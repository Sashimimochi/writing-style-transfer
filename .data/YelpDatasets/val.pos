this place is quite possibly my favorite restaurant in phoenix.
my favorites are the chicken scarpariello, the pizza and the sangria.
my wife can't decide between four dishes.
our daughter loves the penne ala vodka, lasagna, or ravioli.
i've seen them bend over backwards to try and take care of obvious jerks.
all the other places treated it as a marketing event and brought coupons.
get the idea?
it's all good at this neighborhood gem!
dr.k. & dr.b. together with their agape team are caring, professional, thorough and knowledgeable.
each visit is carefully tailored to your current state of being and needs.
their communication was great.
cutest little dive bar in the city!
chill vibe, cheap (and yummy) drinks, delicious food, and family owned.

the gang at sun valley stereo is definitely top notch.
when i first left there was some adjustments needed.
they took me back in without hesitation and made everything right.
the installer was committed to treating my car like it was his own.
now that's going the extra mile!
this time tried the angry dog and just as amazingly deelish!!!
my 2 friends who had the chili dog said the chili was very good!

beef or chicken, both delicious.
affordable, quick, and take some tortillas home for later.
their specialty dishes are very unique.
the spicy tuna nachos are amazing.
some of my favorites are: lemon roll and the edamame is a must.
beautiful private room, we sat on cushions  in a very cozy setting.
two thumbs up!!!!
pho (soup) and their banh minhs (sandwiches) are to die for!!!
not to mention their chinese food choices!!!!
this place is a hole in the wall but their food choices are awesome!!!
located 5 miles from the airport, no traffic, parking is not a problem either!!!!
the staff are courteous and gets your order right!!!

when i come for healthy vegan food, that's all i really want.
i just wish there was somewhere like this in calgary.
woke up earlier this week with a crazy case of torticollis.
couldn't turn my head to the right and i was having spasms like crazy!

the owner provides great customer service.
ask to receive the fish and meat emails.
just moved to phoenix.
stopped at hinckley's for some much needed lighting and fan advice.

i prefer the younger lady for the pedi.
she really takes her time and massages your legs a lot.

every dish we had was delicious and unique.
lots of gluten free options for me as well.
will for sure go again when were in vegas next.
i had their seasonal tres azteca with the raspberry syrup- tasted like godiva chocolate.
it's a little on the rich side, but very tasty.
my fianc had the churro latte which is now his new favorite.
if we lived closer, this place would become our go-to coffee spot.
nonetheless, support local business!
it's the perfect place to go to!
we split a greek salad and ordered a pizza.
it was half pesto, half alfredo sauce with feta & gyro meet.

i live in henderson so public school is a destination for me/us.
conversation at our table for lunch was fine as it was sparsely full.
i saw don rickles there.
he was great, amazing timing.
you knew the lines were coming but he made them funny every time.
the theater is very nice.
we sat far left (stage right) and could see and hear perfectly.
my suggestion, though, would be not to sit on the side like we did.
as for rickles, he couldn't really make it to our side of the stage.
so the strip district is very convenient for me to say the least.
i will tell you that it's very crowded on fridays/saturdays...
so be prepared for that.
their hot dogs are the bomb!

yasu is a must-try sushi experience in toronto.
$80 for an 18 pc omakase is well worth the price.
i would eat it twice in one night but it is surprisingly satiating.
and get a bar seat.
the whole night is a performance.
fresh ingredients that melt in your mouth.
5/5 would eat again and again and again.
the bar is large and well-stocked.
they could probably stand to add a third bartender for bigger shows.
there is surprisingly plenty of parking.
you'll find a lot across the street and also behind the venue.
the ultimate place to go shop for korean grocery.
we actually come here especially for that.
wish we had this in utah.

the fried chicken here was probably the best i've ever had.

the watermelon that came with the combo was great as well.
this is tucked away in the venetian on the bottom floor near the casino.
i would definitely come here again for the chicken.
this place is seriously one of my most favorite place to go.
it is unbelievably cheap!!
most of the games range from $.25 to $1.
give it $10, maybe $15 for the night and you're set.
i love how there are so many arcade games there.
i guess the only downside to it is how the place looks.
the inside looks a little janky.
from the outside, you could never tell what wonders lies on the inside.
but i guess that's good because its not packed like game works.
this place is awesome and cheap.
i nearly threw up!
but then i realized that they just moved, is all.
i can still get my crack buns!!!
wow, that sounds terrible!
pizza rev was amazing when i went there the other week.

the only thing i would forego are the mac and cheese bites.
nothing special about them and they're a bit bland.

prices are beyond fair for the quality of her work.
i would highly recommend her.
you won't be disappointed!
came here for the prime rib burgers and damn it was really good.
the quality of the meat and the extra pickles were great.
i wouldn't order the chips again as they were soooo salty.
the atmosphere is pretty cute, i would definitely have a date there.
it's really small and intimate.
the service was also pretty good!
i'm going back!
keep eating, angela
l'endroit est bien dcore, l'ambiance est relax et elle devient plus festive en soire.
wow amazing team so polite and friendly, i lucked in for sure!
had an emergency broken tooth and needed to go to work.
teeth are important in the service industry.
the bella smiles team did me straight.
i had the tooth fixed and my smile was looking just as new.
it was done so quickly and smoothly.
i know where all my teeth will be cleaned and worked on moving forward.
thank you dr casey and dr chawla.
vegas...oh baby...where the dark side in people come out to play.
remember, what happens in vegas...never happened.
i've gone several times and have not been disappointed in the rooms.
melt has half and full sized sandwich options.
the price difference is just a few bucks.
plan to share it or take it to go.
had a great sandwich there and also a good salad.
decent number of beer choices in a nice relaxed atmosphere.
problem is it is pretty busy and packed.
i can see why...
love me some lucky thai!!
also, they deliver!!
love it, and i'll order again and again!
a great shopping experience with friendly staff who are a pleasure to work with!
awesome selection of new and gently loved designer fashion and accessories!
i'm updating my old review.
5-star for kristina!
she's great and easy to deal with!
the 2-stars is mainly for the convenience of this location for me.
otherwise i would keep going to tide in ahwatukee.
this is definitely overpriced!
even with a coupon, they still charge you an arm and a leg.
sometimes even your liver too!
cheapest iphone 5 screen replacement i could find in town.
got a $65 cash price + the $5 yelp discount.
fast and looks great.
30 day guarantee.
small dining room which was fine for me.
great service and the food was wonderful!
i highly recommend the lettuce wraps and pad thai.

a great place to relax, knock back some brews and make new friends.
a very friendly and accommodating staff, decent prices and great food.
wow, this is such an exciting day.
i will call him first whenever i need help!
i cannot say enough about red rock painting and six stars is not possible.
he always followed up as promised.
i would highly recommend red rock painting; professional work at a fair price.
good crew and programming!
def recommend this box to anyone looking for a close community and awesome wods.
fast, delicious and good food!!
the chicken  kabobs were amazing
went to get a manicure and a shellac.
what a professional service.
manicure  very thorough and shellac lasted for almost 4 weeks.
amazing salon because they focus on satisfying their customers.
they always be on time even though it is crowded salon.
i normally don't do reflexology massage but i make an exception for this place.
cute small place with great coffee and delicious sandwiches...
everything was delicious and service was very nice...
the phone people have all the records at their fingertips and are very pleasant.
shipment is free and trackable.
the best place for a burger in markham.
french fries are always fresh too!
these guys do greek food exceptionally good too!
5 stars all around.
went here for my anniversary.
small place with a lot of charm and outdoor seating.
absolutely loved the tiff waffle macchiato
this restaurant is great...really good italian food.
starts of with really soft bread and the best olive oil.
the spinach and artichoke dip is just mind-blowing.
the pizzas and pastas are delicious and so is the dessert.
eddie the server provided outstanding customer service!
for the lgbt community, ask for eddie!
took care of us 7 queens!!
it's been too long since i've had a flaming fajita.
portions are very generous, prices are fair, and nice atmosphere.
i always get the steak fajitas for two and split it with the wife.
plus they re-fill them no questions asked.
they light your fajitas up when they get to your table.
the guy served us has a sense of humor.
i love how they made the sauce heavily based with garlic.
you just can't stop eating the seafood with it.
back again many times.
always hire nice, polite kids, never a problem with my daughter's gluten allergy.
great arby's location.
one of my favorite places to stay but it is costly.
large luxury suites, canal shoppes, beautiful decor and a very large sports bar.
two clubs to choose from tao and lavo.
both clubs are awesome.
the front desk, casino and restaurant staff are awesome.
always attentive and kind.
i will always return to the venetian and palazzo.
we were not disappointed!
i ordered the james harrison and my husband had the arsenio hall.
the james harrison was ridiculously amazing.
the caramelized onions were cooked perfectly.
my husband said his arsenio hall was also great.
they even had ice cream, but we were too full to try it out.
i highly recommend this restaurant!
had dinner here with my girls on night one of my bachelorette weekend.
the hostess, server and all staff we interacted with were super friendly.
food was delicious!
great pizza cooked in a coal fire oven.
third time, for the $7.99 thali to go.
also ordered 2 veggie samosas.
guess what, no onions this time!
seriously i'm blown away right now.
home to the best sunday brunch in vegas.
chef mike's menu is full of goodness.
the saturday dynamic flow classes are awesome!
the class is a full hour and is the perfect weekend workout.
the class has a mixture of cardio, strength training, and plyometrics.
great food and service.
the bartender tiara is top notch.
i would recommend this place to anyone who wants something different.
finally a solid pho spot in the richmond hill area.
the hills have been missing a good pho spot.
the place is nice and clean and the service is solid.
no sense of "fresh eyes" for the exception of customizable pieces.
as a business owner myself i much rather support non corporate local businesses.
that's like half the price of everything i've found!
so i contacted matt (the coach) and signed up.
very flavorful vegan food-hipster approved (; they have yummy vegan desserts as well.
my compliments to the manager of this store.
i would recommend this particular store to all my friends and family members.
in particular their pharmacy department is outstanding, especially a pharmacy tech named jeanie.
this review is well overdue!
dave and jeff planned everything out and made things happen so perfectly.
if you're a fan of the beatles, this show is a "must-see" for you!
each time i've gone i've sat in the 100, 200, and 300 sections.
they make authentic middle eastern baked breads that are delicious.
i ordered when i arrived and it took about 15 minutes.
everything was super fresh.
it's family owned/run and everyone was really nice.
if i could rate it an additional star i would.
the food and smoothies are amazing.
no filler, just top notch, quality ingredients for super fresh and nutrient dense food.
their prices are so affordable.
we just moved here and have become regulars already!
there are few things in life that i totally crave- that i dream about...
however, the chicken pho from #1 pho is one of those items.
this place nails it!
it's the best pho place in cleveland.
it's a great spot for a quick lunch or dinner.
the food comes out of the kitchen in just a few minutes after ordering.
awesome customer service and i always find a bargain.
beautiful clothes for a fraction of the original cost.
visited on a sunday for the snow cone margaritas.
margaritas were the best of both worlds.
reminds you of your childhood but they are filled with tequila!
the restaurant is absolutely beautiful!
bar was gorgeous and the service was great!
will be coming back!

it's casual, but very clean recommend 100% - yum .
one word, wow!
it was really amazing how they put the whole show together.
hard to put in words but you will understand when you've seen it.
so don't waste money on the better seats.
really worth it!!
vegetable chow mein and orange chicken!
what a happy day!!!

10\10 good place to grub.
reasonably priced and not to expensive
i bring friends here and i meet friends here.
great pic up place!
this was my third home inspection on three homes in two different states.
i can't say enough good things about stinkweeds.
if they don't have it, they'll order it.
walking in, you really get the sense that this is a shrine for music.
the staff is knowledgable and helpful.
i'd hate to think what the lightrail construction is doing for their business.
i do my part by buying all my music there.
and, hey, you should too.
i have been to yasu 4 times and all experience are very impressed!
that's why i come back again and again.
the new sashimi plate for $25 definitely worth the price.
a must add on for the first time visit.
remember to leave some room for the ice cream.
yasu is always my favourite omakase location
i love sushi ken!
the staff are all so friendly and welcoming, and the food is delicious.
i'd recommend the chicken curry (my favorite) and the rice bowls!
excellent food and service!!
such a rarity.

can't beat the prices either...will definitely be returning :)
they never try to trick you and always do whatever they can to help.
they ordered it and replaced it for me as quickly as possible.
vanessa is the best!
she mentioned the tasting menu and we were  blown away!
ask for vanessa and tell vaz you came for her!!
teressa was an awesome help when looking for a new home.
she was helpful and very on top of the market!
i would recommend her to anyone looking to find a new place.
this place is always consistent when i order.
i recommend the pineapple fried rice with chicken.
i've used to take out and dine in on several occasions.
this is seriously some of the best bbq in las vegas/henderson.
burnt ends are lip smacking.
such talented girls and so friendly!

i had a really good time here for brunch one weekend...
and that's coming from someone who doesn't really "do brunch" often.
firstly, i love love rabbits so obviously the decor was a+ to me!
the other wasn't bad, just not as great (cubana).

his follow-up was impressive!
great place to grab a bite to eat.
potato scrambled delicious.
i would recommend this please for sure.
wonderful auto shop for anyone.
i am surprised at reading some of the poor reviews on this place.
i think the lunch buffet was 9.99.
i really liked their dumplings and teriyaki chicken sticks.
i thought everything was very good actually, as did the rest of my family.
the desserts weren't that great but you don't go to chinese buffets for desserts.
also, i found the staff very pleasant and attentive.
they now offer vegan cheese and vegan chicken!
and it's the same price as non vegan.
i'm not a vegan but a friend had it and said it's awesome.
bob and darcy were amazing to work with!
or, go stand in the shade and enjoy!
you can also see them from nearby hotels.
i would imagine paris is a good spot to see them.
they're free, they're amazing, you can watch them for hours and not get bored.
apparently vegas does sleep.
on the night we went, it was piano karaoke night.
pick a song, the piano man does his thing, random amateur singers do theirs.
but the singers this night were far from amateur.
very chill spot to meet regulars, local first timers and tourists.
the servers seriously couldn't of been any better!
great experience and amazing food!
would recommend to everyone visiting akron!!!
i love this place!
teresa oursland was my stylist and she did an outstanding job on my hair.

i can't say enough about cnn mortgage.
las vegas locals highly recommending q bistro!
the budajjigae is delicious and perfect for winter weather!
the broth is so flavorful with a little spiciness to it.
the bulgogi is always a favorite go-to dish.
it was completely submerged for at least 5-10 minutes.
he was really upfront about the costs which were reasonable in my opinion.
apparently they specialize in water damage.
;-) i highly recommend you bring your ipad, iphone, etc.
here for repairs.
i am giving them the best when i take them to pecan grove..
dr. edwards is who i typically see and she is extremely knowledgeable.
truly, some of the best vet care i could ask for.

definitely putting them on the friday night date night rotation.
veggie burgers can be hit or miss, but this one is definitley a hit.

i don't know why one yelper called this a greasy spoon!!
just a sweet diner with a touch of class.
great seasoned meat, full of flavor.
great service, and actually cares for the customers.
adorable mexican wrestling theme.
the tres leche is to die for, and so are the tacos!
i recommend this to anybody that wants an amazing family friendly, (mexican food) restaurant.

i get their carne asada tacos and i'm pleased with them every single time.
honestly, this is the best indian food i've had so far.
i usually order aloo matar with basmati rice and garlic naan.

it's simply the best so far!
trust me, you won't be disappointed!
after researching crossfit i decided to give it a try.
it's been a lot of fun and really challenging.
the people at crossfit san tan are awesome - really friendly and knowledgeable.
my only regret is that i didn't try this out sooner.

i saved $800 with them in extras ...
they were friendly considerate and made sure the job was done right ..
they were on time ..
i have heat again ...
and wouldn't even take a tip!!
the rest of the staff are always very helpful and attentive.
if that's not added value for your money, i don't know what is.
that, my fellow yelpers, is what it's all about!
and she and lenny's will continue to earn my business.
well done lenny and jennifer!
best wishes for continued success!
austin was a typical rambunctious malinois.
it was the best 3 week investment into austin we could have ever done.
thanks for everything andrew and chad!
highly recommend this place for chinese dim sum.
it is small, hidden away inside the gold coast hotel and casino.
very well worth it to come and visit.
their dim sum is so delicious.
seriously, who knew you can go to vegas and get authentic chinese dim sum.

not sure what to expect in a coffee bar....this was a surprise!
a functioning barbershop with the coffee.
we didn't stay and experience different beverages but ordered lattes to go.
artistically beautiful and the best latte ever.
and i have had a long relationship with lattes!
would walk here for a coffee every day!
our server noelani was amazing and everything we ordered was delicious!
definitely get the chicken parmesan.
dr. olson is a total rockstar!
i had a fleur de lis tummy tuck per his recommendation.
his breadth of knowledge was vast, and his attention to detail unsurpassed.
i was told no, but they would serve up a new batch around midnight.
they got us financed.
really nice menu and service!
lots of veggie options, and gluten-free choices, too.
try after, say, 2:00pm and there won't be a wait.
this will quickly become one of your favs.

i keep reading other posts comparing them to sprinkles...me personally, i dont like sprinkles.
i think that they are small, chinzy on frosting, dry and overpriced.

food was very delicious and fresh!
best mexican food in the area!

it turned out to be a bad front left axle.
mike's auto fixed that issue, but then went above and beyond.
they did it because they wanted the ride to be perfect.
mike's auto has earned a customer for life!
most exquisite cuisine, best restaurant in town!
the service is impeccable, attention to details and super friendly staff!
each course better than the previous!
classic example the excellence is not expensive it is actually priceless!!!
i am sorry it took me that long to find this place!
the people who don't like it probably are the ones stealing!
she has a huge amount of products and variety of brand!
always find what i need!
we have to protect the small businesses in las vegas.
they are not a corporation that fits loss in their bottom line!
be respectful and stop stealing!

today i tried a new creation and i think it warrants an updated review.
needless to say i should have just bought the whole thing.
well, there were only 3 pieces left but you get the idea.
if you see this on the case just get it.
don't ask questions and thank me later ;)
i just threw my husbands birthday dinner here on july 23'rd of this year.

the staff is extremely friendly and helpful.
we will always purchase our bikes from here.

customer service is what makes this place extra great.
food is amazing!
long lines but sooo worth it.
service was great n friendly.

honestly i haven't been in a barnes & noble store probably for years.
came here to check out a book my son took with him to read.

so in the long run it likely could be less than other online stores.
came into abc auto got a quote within a few minutes, very reasonable.
looks brand new, would recommend them to anyone.
jason is such a pleasant man.
i've used him since before he opened his own company.
he stands by his work and has very fair prices.

this place is unlike any other car rental center i've been to.
everyone gets herded onto a bus to this mythical rental car center place.

this place was on point and we will be back for sure.
very clean and modern facility.
the only problem was i'm lousy at skee ball.
lan zhou noodles was  - it was spicy and soup base was very flavorful.

you may have to wait for a table.
it does get crowded, and they are closed for dinner.
just wanted to thank mimi and then gang at new look.

i went there last week with my spouse and we had an amazing experience.
and, i'm kind of an opinionated person.

don't let the negativity get in your way, def give them a chance.
ask for kenny.
when we got here our room was so clean and spacious.
the room service in the morning was awesome.
the pool and jacuzzi were very nice and relaxing.
i also enjoyed the huge casino at this hotel.
over all i would definitely stay here again.
we decided to eat on the cheap so ordered ala carte.
and a side of rice and refried beans (worthy of no further mention).
service was ok, you have to be more proactive with requesting your check.
we will definitely go again!

this restaurant used to be called penang.
i think they just change their name after renovation.
the food and the menu seems the same.
i mean they still have my favorite from yesteryear.
the nasi lemak, the hainan chicken rice and the roti chanai.
next time i am gonna try some other stuff.
the best pho restaurant i have eaten ate in my life.
pho here is the main star.
it looks like heaven and every bite is like eating heaven.

she has had 2 hematoma, one on each ear.
the vet team at crossroads has been nothing short of amazing.
dr o is the most caring veterinarian that i have ever met.
i highly recommend them!!
this place gets 5 stars simply because it's an alabama bar in scottsdale.
thier bean dip and queso are on point as well.
i don't know why i was so surprised.
i guess cause it came from a little cart inside a comic book store?
bonus: it was quick.
no waiting around like the busier coffee shops on main.
if you love the beatles, you will love this show.
end of story.
it's not the same as other cirque shows, but it couldn't be.
the more you know about the beatles, the more you will enjoy this show.
i'm not going into detail, as i don't want to give things away.
there are a lot of cirque elements, you just have to look for thrm.
so, all in all, sit midway to the back to enjoy the entire show!
easily my favorite steakhouse in vegas.
and one of the best sirloin steaks a ive ever had.
service is outstanding and the sides and sauces are all fantastic.
can't go wrong with any of the protein selections on the menu!
i come every time i'm in town.
my family had an unexpected passing and it was devastating.
the food is great at a good price.
i highly recommend it!
david wong's has the best thai food in las vegas hands down!

the food is extremely fresh, the onion, peppers and green beans are so crisp!
everything i try is amazing!
my favorites are chicken green curry, drunken noodles, and red nah.
i recommend to everyone i see!
we finally changed our entire family over to skyline.
the front staff is great and always professional.
dr. kerry green is great, but so are the pa's.
they listen, which is son nice at a medical office.
i don't like condescending medical professionals.
i haven't used this yet, but it was one of the reasons for changing.
we're excited to have a place for the entire family.
get away from the tourist food and enjoy some excellent breakfast.
you will not be disappointed.
so much high quality selection!
thai, fresh fresh sushi, wonton soup with all the fixings!
they had crab legs and an amazing salad station.
we got discounted tickets at tix4tonight so for $17 bucks we did well.
this place is cool!
a little expensive, but worth going!!!

the hot coco looked boss!!!
mistakingly ordered from the wrong location.
to top it off the food was so good.

i wish it wasnt but it was still delicious none the less.
all the tapas we got were delicious, including the falafel, potatoes, scallops, shrimp...
lvcc made our wedding cake and i loved it!!
all flavors we tried during our cake tasting were delicious.

we're going back for the sunday brunch & $4 unlimited french toast.

my friend and i are regulars here.
i always get the black bean burger, and i absolutely adore it.
the chips with truffle sauce are also excellent.
i'd probably eat here everyday, if i could.
seriously such a good find.
5 stars for sure.
we tested them all and they were all amazing.
the lavender was delish.
and same with the rosemary.
i am a meat lover.
a classic hamburger is my all time fav.
so when my friend took me to this vegan restaurant i was skeptical.
i ordered the "banquet burger" with bean sprouts and veggie bacon.
and it was so good and super filling.
if you're like me and love burgers gives this vegan place a try.
tastes amazing, great service and a bonus that it fills you up!
if i am in the area, i will go again!
love the green sauce!
food is great, portions are perfect size!
the carne asada nachos are great!
everytime we get into pittsburgh late at night - this is our first stop.
i love this bar, i can't wait to be back next week!
in my opinion, the carne asada fries are better here than roberto's.
only because the fries stay crunchy longer vs the one at roberto's.
the fries @ roberto's become soggy quickly.
they also serve tamales!!!
which i love!!
clean, reasonable price, nice staffs but not close to the strip.
will try again when in town.
we will be coming back and bringing friends and family!

in both occasions we were impressed by the magnitude of dishes to pick from.
there was numerous dishes for every palate in my group.
the staff at this amtrak station are the best!!!
kim's only goal is to provide excellent customer service.
i witnessed kim work with a passenger in a wheelchair.
the passenger had difficulty speaking, and communicating .

wife had veggie and that was good also.
asked for pinto beans instead of refried and they had no problem doing it.
found my new spot in vegas for best burritos!
hands down customer service from the crew to the manager.
i became a regular customer just cause of the great customer service they provide.
- they close at 6pm.
the pros- these folks know what they are doing!
- i needed a waterproof zipper replaced on a mec pack.
i love this backpack.
it's perfect and didn't feel like throwing it out was the way to go.

my boyfriend suggested i try this because he had been there and loved it!
absolutely delicious...real cooking and very friendly family.

their greek dressing is amazing.
not too much oil, lots of herbs and always fresh.
we had a great experience at out first time doing an escape room !
it's a really fun outing to do with a group !

today was my very first full treatment appointment with dr. wrye.
without question dr. wrye is tremendously skilled in many treatment methods.

signs now is awesome.
we are always having to change our large pylon signs.
working with many sign companies in the past has been very trying and difficult.
until we found signs now.

our tenants are picky and want to change things constantly.
we will continue to use signs now for all of our centers.
