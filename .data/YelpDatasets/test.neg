total bill for this horrible service?
i checked online the pills can be had for 19 cents each!
avoid hospital ers at all costs.
met a friend for dinner there tonight.
the server only brought us one menu.
we received the starters and the mains at the same time.
the wings, brisket, and mac and cheese were alright at best.
food was somewhere between okay and decent.
service was somewhere between piss poor and terrible.
the food wasn't very good, way too greasy.
my fries were luke warm and my tray was literally covered in grease.
i needed about 50 napkins and a shower after that.
the service was pretty awful too.
i can't believe i paid $14 for a small meal with no extra fixings.
on national cheeseburger day of all days too.
such a disappointment and i've never gone back since.
best thing about it was the soda, but that's pretty difficult to mess up.
i have no idea what the owner's problem is, but he's incredibly rude.
his wife, on the other hand is super nice (an odd mix).
great space, rude owner and the coffee is average.
rebel doesn't take credit cards and charges you to use debit.
not very convenient for people going to the lake.
we will just fill up elsewhere.
the place is filthy, too.
two days later my nails are lifting and more bubbles appeared.
worst service ever.
only one here and took 10 minutes to get one drink out.
3 people behind the counter including the manager.
they were all talking and doing other things
even for airport food.
don't push the "prompt service" button on the table.
the waitress said that they ignore it.
i'm truly disgusted by the service of this restaurant.
over priced nasty nachos.
the meat was so salty i couldn't eat them.
and they tried to sell me a regular bottled water for $7.
i will never go to this place again!!!
this place sucks!!
never, never, never again(back to yard house for real food)
oph all over this country is amazing.
i've enjoyed them in minneapolis, chicago, la and seattle.
open another franchise somewhere else in this valley..
we ordered today and the pizza had onion on the whole thing.
the manager was rude and didn't want to replace the pizza.
the seafood was not fresh and was going bad !!!!
hands down worst gluten free cupcake i've ever had.
i cannot believe anyone would associate that product with their name, it was terrible.
the vanilla flavor wasn't the problem.
i'm disappointed, especially considering the cupcake was $5 after tax.
they have you held captive because they are only part done with each piece.
i will never rent from budget rent a car, again.
when i complained to budget later, i was told, sorry, you signed the contract.
shady, shady business.
did i mention that the place is like half full.
they of course add 18% for parties of 6 or more so great!
i get to way overpay for the wrong food.
i got lazy and didn't want to leave the resort.
bad call there.
this company is run by an absolute a*****e..
do not, i repeat do not do business with this company.
i have been here way too many times, and we are over it.
we will not be back.
management here is consistently unprofessional and argumentative with customers.
one especially is tyler sims; we aren't sure.
he hides his name tag.
we've witnessed this with how they have handled others complaints as well our own.
less clean than most other harkins.
it's a newer theatre but it's been run into the ground.
we recommend the harkins theatres at park west or arrowhead.
they don't even deserve a single star but their was no other choice.
stay far away from this unethical company if you can avoid it.
nothing but a sham.
the company needs to be rebuilt from the top on down.
and 2) the same kids do not make the all-star team?
coaches kids or something???
the excitement wore off about 5 minutes into the visit.
i ordered a ruben and my husband ordered a corned beef sandwich.
skip this place.
they were very manipulative and literally ripped us off.
don't go there because the price is absolutely not worth the food!
the bartenders and staff are very nice.
we had an okay time.
i've had nothing but bad experiences here.
so, then i wait for 10 minutes while they figure it out.
i won't be going back.
this place recycles rice and food.
avoid pork and clams, their meat is half rotted!!!
roast pork and duck taste ok.
also they do not take credit cards.
just avoid this place.
the wait time, gasp, is 45 minutes....
i have a full time job.
i should be able to cancel a flight online.
not worth the discounts!
had to listen to this yeehaw cringe birthday song 3 times in 1 hour.
trees trees trees
i highly would recommend a man never go here.
please do not order with them.
they were unable to deliver the product and refused to take any blame.
awful awful awful.
they made no attempt to help in the suituation.
i'll go elsewhere next time and so should my carpenter.
i always hated urgent cares.
how is that even possible?
beds don't fit canadian mattresses.
one star is generous.
forget getting the ketchup or napkins.
they can't seem to remember that for literally 10 seconds.
first stop there in over a year...was desperate and in a rush.
and forget calling them...the busy signal is the only customer service you will get.
the place was nice and all, but there wasn't a lot to choose from.
a lot was cold already..
we were instantly turned off and left.
later that night my husband ended up barfing up his whole dinner.
needless to say, we will never come back.
and advise strongly against anyone else coming.
customer service is crap.
no personality .1 and done for me.
so many other italian eateries in the area..
i get it.
never happens, the managers are sweethearts, but the employees they need to check into.
4 out of 5 times i get mayonnaise & a dirty look .
honestly the one star is for the managers.
if i could give the restaurant less stars i would.
it was 108 degrees outside and the ac wasn't working.
soon after, when we got water, there was a bug in the water cup.
it was disgusting.
even the food wasn't great.
i chose not to give them my business for a year or so.
i gave the second chance when i normally would not, big mistake!
seals the deal for me, will never give my business again.
wish i could give negative stars.
the only thing worse than the food here was the service..
evertime i went for lunch it was dead (no shock).
even with no one in the place the servers were absent..
yep they're closed.
in short don't trust this operation.
horrible concession lines.
stood in line for 40 minutes for a water.
missed entire second act.
never be back.
the worst management ever.
plus poor classes and aerobic equipment and no amenities.
super disappointed and left within an hour.
people act like they're special, it's over crowded..no room to walk ...
long wait for the bar...
clubs at paris, cesar's, bellagio:..
even chillin at the bars around are more legit.
music is rad but nothing else about this place is.
since moving to the area wanted to try this place...
wish we never did..
staff not friendly no plans on returning ...
went in for a mani/pedi.
nails look horrible.
they have bumps and paint on my skin.
strongly recommend going somewhere else.
first and last time.
you don't need to call for reservations because they don't even care.
worse experience ever!
got in there, no one came out to the counter.
they gave me no lids for my ice cream(3) to go.
i would rather make the drive to cold stone next time.
i usually have them do a $17-20 job which is typically ok.
to add even more insult i paid an additional $59 for an oil change.
onto the $3 places!!!!
had oysters that were off.
drinks never came.
needless to say we would never go back.
watched the hostess taking tips which bumped us down the list.
very expensive fish and chips.
i bought bean sprouts from here.
i came home and the entire bag was heavy and soaked in mildew.
the bean sprouts were bad.
they charge by the weight.
health department please visit this location asap!
this location deserves a 0 stars!
awful just awful!
management needs fired because it never gets better!
awful just awful!
every dish no matter what it was tasted the same and looked the same.
boring tasteless food.
ordered a 16 camera in oct 2013.
with in a year the dvr died.
now this one's hard drive is grinding and has no pictures on the monitor.
i thing that the second dvr should have been warranted for a year.
i personally think a system should last much longer than a year.
stay away from this company.
they don't stand behind their shitty products.
during dinner a cockroach crawled up the wall right next to our table.
the service was horrible!
the margarita pizza tasted like it had canned tomato sauce on it.
this place was a complete let down!
the hostess approached me with a water, but i was on my way out.
if their busy be prepared to wait...
we will never go back!!
from the start of wedding day till the end it was a horrible experience.
the decorations were lacking cheap and minimal.
we brought a ton of our decorations which helped but don't rely on them.
beware do not get married here!
worst wedding i've ever been in and i've been in 7!
to the manager at best buy,  my time is valuable.
this guy left water marks all over the grill and paint.
i spent $17 for that yellow rice.
i wish yelp has negative stars i would have given negative 10.
i bet you can cook better than what they are serving here.
so watch out guys
was approached in our neighborhood by a few guys in regards to our windshield.
i knew it was cracked but hadn't really put much into replacing the glass.
well a week later and there still is no check.
i text cody about my displeasure and shockingly there was no response.
this is a terrible company who lures people in with promises they can't keep.
i would never recommend them.
bearded bar staff sucks.
new owners i think.
whole staff is about raking your money.
the old faithful (large) crowd has left.
the food sucks now.
they used to cook steaks on a grill outside.
surely losing money and soon to change owners.
go at your own risk.
very disappointed and shocked!
pretty much the same as all of the other reviews.
can't ever get someone on the phone with customer service.
the speeds are dial up slow.
i can hardly make it through a netflix movie without it buffering several times.
it's unfortunate that they have a monopoly on this building.
she obviously had double booked.
i recognized her voice from when i made the appointment.
will take my business elsewhere and suggest others do the same.
ill remove this review after i get a call back, until then, 1 star.
he then said rudely "call them, they will screw you good".
i said thanks & hung up.
they only want easy sales & not put any efffort in.
they won't be getting my business in the future.
wanted to substitute sausage for bacon in a breakfast burrito.
they charged me an extra $1.00 for that.
i asked her why.
she said she is not allowed to substitute any ingredients - ever.
i won't be back.
doesn't matter how good the food is.
restaurants with business practices that don't make sense do not earn a return visit.
veal sangwich  (tasteless) no sauce  very dry one piece of veal .
very expensive $18 with a coke won't be going back.
lamanna's  excellent hot food and you get a lot more for less .
well same here...
my husband and i got a patty melt, ravioli and garlic knots.
why did we bother ordering it well done?
maybe they were running low tonight??
nothing more irritating than wasting your money on bad food.
corporate if you are reading this you guys should address this with your managers.
gym equipment is outdated and broken, the tv's are useless too.
the gate is always open so anyone can enter.
and night security is a joke.
je ne retournerai pas.
i added a picture of how my pizza showed up last night!
there's really no excuse for this.
i will never order from them again.
20 minutes to check out, as only the self-checkouts were open and available.
25 people waiting in line behind 6 who were at the self-checkout?
i paid for milk, oj and broccoli, but left the ice cream.
while you are the closest to home, you are certainly not the best.
you have lost my business.
stopped  in today after being away for almost a month.
read my prior reviews.
lots of upset customers and staff like.....
management is clueless and seems to be a revolving door.
wake up and smell the coffee if you can get your machines fixed.
lots of coffee shops in madison we are greatly for that!
stay away from this place...
the food is terrible.
the gulab jamun was spoilt...
if we didn't carry out, i would have returned my entire order.
not to mention, it's very expensive.
this place is not the buizness.
i got tacos which i can't believe were $7.
whathehell we live in az tacos are like cactus here......everywhere!!!!!!!
i don't know if i can do it again.
waited in drive thru for 10 min.
i smiled and said ok.
i waited for 5-6 more min before the guy came out with my food.
he said oh sorry, we ran out of beef.
i didnt order any beef.
i had two kids in the car one being 3 months old crying.
and my chicken wasnt even hot!
i am pretty sure that they forgot about me.
not worth it.
my friend and i both felt sick after ordering take out.
i suggest going somewhere else...
i recently went to this location and ordered the chicken rice bowl.
later that night i started to feel not so good.
i would say stay clear from the chicken !!
the ambience of this place is great, however the service is terrible.
when we spoke up they immediately sat us.
this place has a lot of potential to be good, but currently is horrible.
do not go here.
not surprising because the burgers were overcooked.
ordered the pcp burger - with pimento cheese, fried pickles and bacon.
the burger lacked taste..could only distinguish the bacon..everything else had no distinct flavor.
the french fries were overcooked and soggy and had a slight taste  of fish..
no kids menu so ordered them sliders.
hence the lack of flavor on the bigger burger.
family consensus is go back to five guys.
this guy should be given a zero.
he charges for a retainer and is all ears until he receives that check.
just wanted a soda and fries to hold memover.
at least 15 cars in drive thru.
parked and went inside.
cash registers down and it was bedlom.
it was complete pandomonium.
here is the best part...
my bill was $4.99.
these are the degenerates that bernie sanders wants to give $15/hr and free college.
i do not recommend this place especially for women.
personally, i don't think he likes women.
women: stay away.
i was excited to have a ramen place closer to home.
the portions were small and there wasn't much variety in broth or topping choices.
the fried chicken appetizer was the only decent there.
neither of these were the case at this ridiculous place.
don't waste your time or money.
the bun was just as stale.
the bartender was a rude hipster.
i felt really silly for paying for this.
i guess it's my fault.
there are plenty other delicious mexican restaurants with better customer service.
so surely the food was just reheated.
by far one of the worst massage places ever.
the lady answered phone calls and greeyed people at the door during my massage.
moreover, my 60 min massage was only 50 mins....
please don't waste your time or money at this establishment.
i purchased tile for my cottage from ciot.
price was reasonable (although they quoted $1,600 to deliver!
so i rented a van and took them there myself).
i have 6 boxes unopened left over.
horrible customer service.
pool cleaner was extremely rude to me.
called the office right away and cancelled service.
online system down.
they flaunt the ability to make an appointment.
however, well good luck with that.
be sure you catch them at a good time.
i'm sitting with an entire restaurant staff currently...
hoping to get out of here before i'm 50.
no one answers he phone, and starting 9/29 no drug screens at this location
called for an appointment, they said one of their stylists would text me.
passes me off to her partner and gets me in later that day.
ok. get another text, cancelled.
will not be trying to make an appointment here again!
total waste of time.
visit another location.
seems like they have issues with keeping up with their planes.
i don't recommend using this airlines
obviously they are dishonest, and are not concerned with long term customer satisfaction.
avoid this place at all costs.
we came here on a saturday night.
we asked for water and never got it.
so needless to say they ignored us.
we had to leave our table and chase down the bartender to pay.
the place is very loud too.
the beer was ok.
the margarita was bad.
the pretzels were eh.
definitely go somewhere else.
all 5 stars?
normally, people write reviews to complain about something went bad.
we were regulars.
then...new owners take over and slowly started changing recipes and using sub-par ingredients.
there is so much competition in the area.
won't go back ever again.
worst fajitas i've ever had, totally bland.
side of rice in a dixie cup!!
18.00 to share the worst fajitas i've ever had.
i didn't like toby before, now i feel ripped off by him.
this place is a ramshackle.
mine was a sweet one (iced mocha) and i could manage to finish it.
but i agreed with her after sipping once.
the coffee (probably only iced ones) had a strange disgusting smell and taste.
i tried this place and bradbury's coffee on the same day.
bradbury's was way better.
not even comparable.
probably they focus more on selling wines?
the worst mexican my girlfriend and i have ever had!
just thrown together.
couldn't find our enchilada in the mess of beans, rice and whatever.
greasy hard shell tacos, they sucked.
and to top it all off....
don't even bother wasting your time and money.
i was told no, they had to keep rooms open for emergencies.
so wait, my dizzy and feel like passing out isn't emergent enough?
a 2-hour wait with a mere 4 patients in the waiting room is ridiculous.
if i hadn't felt so yucky i would have left.
unless they make some changes, i recommend finding another urgent care.
joined the husbands for a happy hour after golf and the drinks were horrendous!
i ordered the french 75 which came out totally flat.
the new drink came back and the only difference is that they added sprite.
it was actually kind of insulting.
the food was gross and over fried.
the line here is always 15 20 minutes.
getting fabric cut can be 30+ minutes.
the employees are not knowledgable.
this store is a pot the swallows hours of your time.
this is a regular occurrence.
something should change.
slowest and worst customer service ever.
always under staffed always slooow.
they have the monopoly for 2 reasons.
defeats the concept of easy and fast adjustments totally.
i never have that problem at the charleston location .
damaging to the brand and annoying .
i brought my car in on mon.
and it broke down on the way home .dont take your car there .
used to be a good place.
has gone downhill the last few years.
spent $23.17 on two pastas to go.
the other was a pesto pasta with chicken, not very good either.
i have eaten middle eastern food all over toronto.
came here for lunch and ordered a simple swarma.
while waiting out of curiously and was surprised at the low scoring reviews.
not the end of the world and my sandwich was okay.
my son didn't like the pickles or beets and picked his out.
horribly sticky floors,  reminiscent of walking on fly paper.
bland "food",  generic beer selection.
i'm not returning anytime soon.
and the bill was almost $50!
so much for one $.
we will not be back.
thanks for nothing :)
ace car rental is not inside the airport.
their is a second shuttle which takes you to the car rental site.
they need to change the name "taking advantage"  i will never rent from them
overall i'm just glad to be done with the situation.
i tell everyone i come across how shady this dealership is.
worst car buying experience ever!
don't roll in here if you have a canadian driver's license.
won't let you in for a drink even if you're 45years old....
somebody please take this tired old dog out behind the barn and shoot it!
this dairy queen has a history of messing up orders at the drive thru.
today i sent my daughter to pick up food for our family.
the food isn't all that good for this hassle.
this company is the worst.
their employees are disrespectful and the work is way below par.
my husband love the tacos ...
but i go menudo "to go" of course i took it home.
turns out it have a little meat and like 1/4 cup of corn.
i feel like i got cheated...
i always recommend this place to everyone but now i won't.
since they have nothing ready for me.
they should be investigated
horrible horrible horrible!
this was my first time here, and i'm sure it will be my last.
if pressed, i would have to say it resembles malt ovaltine.
( but with no taste, really bland, ovaltine would be exciting in comparison.
slow service, especially for how slow restaurant was and for what we ordered.
food wasn't great either.
had hummus trio.
hummus was fine but toast points i was give were stale.
it was pretty gross.
i would pass on this place, better places in the same area.
he is a joke!!!, very rude and inconsiderate.
anna is amazing ..
she should be running this show :)...
i was incorrectly billed $11.52 for fuel charges.
when i called to dispute the error, i spoke with lian santon.
one word: avoid.
zero stars if possible.
the way these people run a business is despicable .
you pay an arm and a leg to be treated like shit.
good job suckiest place ever.
my boyfriend just got the worst food poisoning from your subway last night.
he had the rotisserie chicken and has been puking straight from 4-9am.
we will never eat here again.
unfortunate because we live across the street.
we've been trying to call you all morning and you don't answer your phones.
it's pretty ridiculous.
"eat fresh" more like "kill me now"
wish i could give this place zero stars.
came in went to parts desk.
4 people working no one acknowledged my presence.
waited 5 minutes.
then asked hey, can someone please check if you have a part.
response yes when someone is free.
10 minutes later nothing.
i was only customer in the facility.
probably worst customer service i have ever experienced.
so i left and will not be back.
i have eaten here twice...the food was not appetizing at all.
however,  the deserts are ok...
the menu says the beer i ordered was $5, i was charged $11.
so i didn't order more because i was lied to.
i left after staying and being miserable for two hours.
i hope i never get dragged here again.
ordered a jack on the rocks.
it came out clear.
hmm i wonder if they water down their liquor.
yea, we won't be back.
i just recently started shopping at this company.
still trying to evaluate how the clothing will work out at this point.
however, the encounters i have had with their employees have not been pleasant.
i feel the definitely need improvements in customer service.
there seems to be a lot of flawed logic in their company policies.
at least the interpretation of them by employees.
will likely avoid this store.
not sure how online service is though.
this is the worst customer service i've ever been to.
called again cannot return or exchanged.
bad bad bad bad bad bad bad!!!!!
i wish i can put a neg star!!!
when bad pizza and service go bad.
has anybody had this experience before?
michael, please get an employee that cares about your customers.
please review your videos from 12:30 to 1pm.
special finance is a joke.
was told about all these banks they have that help people.
just stay away
garlic fries are very greasy.
i had the thai chicken bowl which was advertised as a red curry.
it was probably the worst meal i have ever paid for.
i hate this fucking stinky ghetto shithole.
my car was broken into here in broad daylight.
there's always unsavory characters lolling about, and that's just the people that work there.
so you're asking now why i even come here, and i don't blame you.
sometimes, a girl doesn't have time to  drive to a first-world facility.
i wanted a roof replaced and some leaky skylights repaired.
these guys came pretty solidly recommended but sorry i can't say the same.
honestly, i've never seen a guy not want a job any less.
must be nice being able to refuse work so easily.
i'd rate zero stars but they don't let you.
thank the lord snap fitness is right across the street.
they said that new people messed up the order...
not a good excuse.
pizza boxes saturated with grease...very gross.
pretty piss-poor service...look for other options.
what's the point of an appointment time.
will not be rescheduling.
plan to taken hours off work if you go.
sushi did not taste fresh.
and whatever sauce they used on my not-fresh dragon roll almost made me puke.
service was decent though.
that deserves the one star i am forced to put on here.
i took my husband out to breakfast with my kids this morning.
i asked her to take it back and she did.
no apologies, no offer to remake it or to replace it with something else.
the manager didn't even emerge to apologize.
sadly, this is the second chance i've given this location.
i will never be back.
we had high expectations, but we're very disappointed.
we had both ribs and chicken, and both were way over cooked and dry.
everything was what you would expect of a chain.
we won't be back.
hash-browns are extremely undercooked.
low quality foods,cooked like crap.
service and food were poor quality.
limp salad and the hottest wings tasted like bbq sauce.
won't be going back.
the waitress obviously doesnt like her job.
unfortunately neither they nor i will be ordering from them in the future.
i requested a refund since my food was not delivered as requested.
i'm hoping they'll at least remove the 30+ percent tip i'd already added!
customer beware saw ad for $7.77 oil chance with coupon, typical bait and switch.
these people are bad business bad customer service.
carlos and staff can not be trusted.
why can't i give zero stars?
this place is horrible.
we rented a vehicle through them online and i regret it.
he followed me out the door yelling at me and threatening me.
if you don't want to deal with someone shady- stay away from this place.
if you go there dont let the male hairdresser touch your hair.
gonna be wearing a hat for the next month because of him.
you know that cool mini you ordered?
you are getting a hyundai instead.
employees are very nice but it's under staffed and the shuttle van runs late.
this was the worst experience we have ever had selling a home.
we have sold 4 homes over our lives.
very very poor customer service at the front desk when we checked in.
then my family and i overheard the girls talking about us after we left.
if it wasn't new years in las vegas we would have moved hotels.
hopefully these girls will get updated training.
expect a long wait.
i waited about 2 hours just to be seen.
bring a book or laptop or sleeping bag!
only good thing is, parking is easy and convenient.
we didn't order the sushi because my wife is pregnant.
the don kasu dinner was crispy but the batter didn't stick to the meat.
the staff is rude.
this gym is very dirty and needs new equipment.
everything is always broken down & staff is always unavailable.
this is going to be my first time to write a restaurant review.
i had dinner there last night with my friends it was a birthday party.
i have to say, i found everything about this place to be lackluster.
it was almost inedible.
horrible costumer service and nail work.
customer service is a joke!
disgusting to say the least.
i made the mistake of ordering takeout from here.
this food was not worth the 45$
i should give 0 star to this location!!!
what the hell!!!
no sign outside, no instructions, wtf!!
i walk away feeing really sorry for steve and woz.
the fucking power doesn't work...
am i crazy to remotely consider going back?
which is extremely difficult with our busy schedules.
they also never answer their phone.
i hate this location.
jesus once said: :hypocrite!
i scheduled an online appointment for the installation of a contour dvr.
the confirmation email was received, but the appointment never honored.
no calls or email to apologize for not showing up.
bad, bad, bad!!!!
i usually like bww but this place was bad.
first sign of trouble, "i'll have a ...
this was a first for me.
it was a disorganized mess.
ordered an appetizer and left.
it felt like no one was managing and nobody cared.
can't comment on food because we never ordered due to the lack of service.
very overrated on food and on service.
cafe bricco is costing the doubletree return business.
the manager was unbelievably rude to us.
customer service at its worst.
there are 10 or more nail salons in this fiver mile radius.
i won't ever walk in there again they only do an ok job anyway
zero not even 1 star wrorst experience ever .
manager even told us in signs to f**k our self .
after him thinking we didnt pay our bill .
and bad managment worst experience ever !!!!!!!
closing time on friday according to the location website is 9pm
don't waste your time with these super unprofessional people!
call anyone else.
go to another louboutin store.
i'm used to sales reps from cl to be super helpful, courteous and patient.
i mean i'm about to spend a couple thousand dollars.
i went to crystals to buy me shoes.
the sales ladies are much much nicer!!
long wait, nothing great for food, soggy wings, doughy cheese bread.
sauces are warm and disgusting.
crust of pizza was good but that's it.
i won't be back...too many other options in area.
this is the worst target i have ever experienced.
the clerks are clueless.
the checkers "forget" to say thank you.
9 times out of 10 - awful.
the corn is sweet and has no flavor.
the cheetos are not even spicy at all.
too much cheese and no lime at all.
the mangoneadas are too sweet.
needs more tajin and chamoy and lime.
they literally only put a couple of spoons of chamoy.
need to be more generous with the flavors!
i guess it takes a real native to make these tasty foods!!!!
just waited 25 minutes for an ok burger and chewy fries.
no apology, no explanation.
no reason to do that again.
this specific location is absolutely terrible.
worst customer service, very slow and unorganized.
slow service, inattentive staff, and terrible food.
nyc bicycle (gin drink) was super bitter.
fish was greasy and chips were floppy.
if i could give 0 stars i would.
this was truly the worst experience i've ever had at a food place.
do not go here!!!
the food also was extremely average.
they kept insisting to cancel the reservation instead of keeping a customer.
hertz for the lose!
unprofessional and unwilling to please customers.
both managers were ridiculous but more so, the new lady was clueless.
you know who she is.
went here yesterday april 18th nigh time.
fries were soggy with no salt and burger was burnt.
behold my burger was burnt!
black black black.
i couldn't even finnish the first bite.
and same thing fries had no salt what so ever.
and ordered another burger as well that was missing even sauce.
will definitely never come back now.
i still have nothing from natalie pyles, personal trainer.
also works out of fitness elements.
her facebook page is just as ridiculous as she is.
a group of us are getting together to present something.
it is may, 2017, and still not one cent.
check her out on facebook, and you will see what i mean.
i have given this place 3 chances and it still disappoints me.
the food is subpar, the ambiance is terrible and the servers are rude.
this place won't last long in old town.
stopped in yesterday for dinner.
very bland and not cooked enough.
horrible language barrier here.
how the hell does that make sense?!?
he couldn't even explain to me because his english was terrible.
egg rolls are whackkkkkk!
seems like super generic frozen brand...don't eat here.
only came here since they opened early.
searching yelp now for another pho house because i'm starving!!!
the music is on 10.
but, they don't.
so, everyone is looking at each other  saying what did they say??
i'm not sure i'll ever come back here again.
bad business, making your customers walk out and rushing the ones that were there.
so we just went to the new bakery at 1847..
wow what a disappointment.
$17 for 2 ham and cheese croissants and 2 tarts.
the tart has barely any filling.
selection was poor.
won't be returning.
highly recommend not to bother trying it.
i have been going here for almost 3 years.
pulls away not wanting to go.
i noticed the haircuts were not as good.
same person grooming all the time, very uncaring.
last time was the final straw, cut his whiskers and eyelashes.
i would put 0 if it was offered.
or take 3 months to fix my phone correctly.
thye offered $20.00 off your bill if they did not show up ...canceled ...
or came late...!
basically mis-treating their customers...
they were going in all different directions and falling off.
they looked extremely fake which is not what the pictures looked like.
you could see the glue everywhere.
big waste of money.
this place is the worst "brazilian" restaurant in vegas.
has the feel of a sizzler and the quality of food is less appealing.
asked for chimichurri and no one working there knew what that was...yeah...real authentic.
save your money even if it's the groupon deal.
came here for a morning/lunch buffet and it sucked bad!
i didnt enjoy the food one bit.
ugh can't get the wet dog smell out of my head.
have to nuke a piece of nearly paper thin chicken to reheat?
$32 lunch ...
what a waste!
got the same hardcover book for 12 dollars on amazon in two days.
not cosmic, mediocre.
how old is that bread?
they don't seem to be trying very hard.
shredded mozzarella on an italian sub?
first impression of this place was a bad impression and i won't be back..
this place blew junks tonight.
don't go there.
not going back.
not going back.
worst serving size of a take home tub of ice cream!
the amount of ice cream was too little and you'll pay $7 for it!
never order a tub from this store!
my husband and i made a reservation here on 2/10/11 for his birthday.
our reservation was for 6:45pm.
when we arrived the restaurant  was maybe 40% full.
we were seated at a small 2 person table, right next to another couple.
there was maybe 4 inches of space between the tables.
we got up and left.
service good, but don't expect the food to wow you.
salty and not tasty, beware of too much salty choices.
place is nice, food on the plate no so.
had the dungeness crab rivioli and the veal scaloppinil  dinners.
first time i have been let down by yelp.
this firm place a facebook add indicating no service fee.
since my plumbing problem was not urgent i agreed.
i didn't hear from plumber and they simply were a no show.
i would not suggest use of this service
way better pl,aces to eat breakfast and lunch and they only take cash.
how can anyone screw up breakfast?
it's a shame because i really like popeyes.
0 would be perfect.
i regret my first purchase there and will never recommend it.
most stores in arizona accepts returns even goodwill store.
i so regret my purchase.
unacceptable, i cancelled the order.
don't waste your time ordering from them, there's better mexican places.
chase subsequently denied reimbursement because they could not figure out how the theft occured.
basically, accused me of theft.
i mean 20 min in the walk up for two entrees??
i got full on my pop before my food came.
cheese wasn't melted on my burger..smh..come on yall...we gotta do better
disclaimer: i'm pretty easy to please.
the sesame chicken was passable due to decent sauce.
husband had a soft drink.
maybe the noodle dishes are better.
chicken appears to be cooked from frozen.
friendly service though.
every thing is filthy nobody else here trash everywhere.
i had to wait for service until they got off their cell phone.
i for sure will not be coming back
apparently the plane needs a tire change.
worst customer service ever....oh yeah.....they gave us an $8 meal voucher.
...thanks for nothing allegiant!
this mall belongs to the hood rats now.
it feels like a fight can break out any minute,  and apparently they do.
car break-ins are frequent here.
nothing there is worth it.
stopped in for bagels, never again.
i will not be returning.
over priced, bagels had zero taste, and the cream cheese was so bland.
and, the employees were eating while getting my food!very disappointed!
panera has better bagels and cream cheese.
well worth the trip.
ordered the sesame beef udon noodle stir-fry...
will never come back again.
a complete waste of money as it was inedible.
very pricey too.
once she showed up, she had an attitude!
we told her we'd like a booth for 2.
she said, "fine it'll be 5 minutes."  i'm said really!!
the place was nearly empty!!
we told her we'll go somewhere else.
she again "fine ".
that young lady just cost the server and the company money!!!
the door was locked and the people in the restaurant were cleaning up.
for ten minutes.
old maytag refrigerator?
i dont like to send food back to the kitchen.
i have heard about to many bad experiences when people send food back.
that is restaurant 101.
not the quality i remembered from past times.
what happened here don't know.
hope is just this weekend.
but we left not eating there
however, i can't do that anymore because the cheese display is no longer there!!!
additionally, i wasn't able to buy bread anymore!
my disappointment cannot be put into words.
the name "french grocery" is false advertisement now.
it may be "french", but there's nothing "grocery" about it anymore.
this place has themselves confused with a 5 star restaurant.
if i could give zero stars i would.
at a hotel so can't exactly go to the kitchen and get utensils.
can't even give them the excuse they were busy.
literally no one there.
i hate giving 1 star reviews but i have to in the instance .
5 people were  in line waiting with 1 girl at the register working.
the woman in front of us actually left from having to wait so long.
we had to wait 20 minutes .
someone else working could have helped in instead of having all of us wait.
i will not be coming back.
how could a resort go so bad so fast.
soiled linen and poor maid service would normally turn me off.
i am out never coming here again :(
rip off alert!!
after the "re-inspection" they said it would be $1000 + for just the exhaust!!!
they said i must have done some damage in the 2 months since (???).
the car is inspected with exhaust all for $750!
check angie's list it will save you hundreds!
let me fist say that i do like on the border.
i have had good meals at two other occasions  and everything was great.
not the case here.
i'm not sure he's aware what industry he's in.
food was not good.
black beans tasted like they were poured from a can to my bowl.
barely any chicken in the tacos.
has to ask my waiter for water and he still couldn't complete the task.
people rave about this food and i am unsure why.
never ask her, her name.
terrible experience don't recommend to anybody.
they don't even keep the proper oil filters in stock.
had to wait forever.
will never go back to big o.
big o mistake!
20 minutes in the drive thru with one car at the window.
we left and went elsewhere.
i called on the 14th day, so i was still safe.
the woman on the phone (who answers every time is beyond rude).
bryce took a deposit from me to buy parts for a job and left.
i haven't been able to get a hold of him since then.
i've called the business several times and left several messages...
i would give zero stars; however, the minimum is 1 stars.
they'll look for any reason to kick out guys.
and this is only one complaint.
next ordering and going for pick up is a major production.
the took over 20 minutes  to find me package on back storage.
i think i'll be discontinuing my loyalty to this branch of hot topic.
dont go here!!!
who knows how long it's happening.
to respond to the owner's comment:big box store?
i'm not in the business of buying?
i hope you know how absurd you sound.
allow me to be your guide to the wonderful land of the internet.
i beg to differ.
good day, sir.
we went to see star wars on  1/14/17 ....
i did not feel safe...
i would not recommend this theater ...
no ushers checking the theaters...
will never go back.
there was no bbq food!!!
i don't even see how this mcdonald's has an average of 2 stars!?
heck if i was to ask for a water they'd probably give me sprite.
be careful with what you sign.
now i have a letter from an attorney charging me almost $200.
the manager is a witch.
they are full of crap on what they tell you what your are signing.
go elsewhere, they are thieves
terrible terrible terrible.
my car didn't even come out clean.
pretty frustrating and safe to say i won't be coming back.
will not come anymore
if i could give zero stars i would.
we left after waiting over 23 minutes for our sandwich..
the one star is for the lack of service.
just before i was going to say something, that's when she called me back.
she was so courteous and we even spoketo each other in spanish.
some of the others have attitudes for no reason.
they keep that up, they won't have any business.
this was extremely disappointing because it was for a birthday surprise for my husband.
we paid $230 for a crappy room, and terrible service.
should have stayed elsewhere...
it was so loud, no one could hear that their orders were ready.
many people complained and the staff did nothing about it.
many customers just left rather than try to order.
the manager and staff here are not helpful at all.
my wife and i ordered at the same time.
i ordered the chicken eggs benedict which was gross.
it came out right away though.
the service was bad, the food was worse.
the chicken was all breading and no meat.
this particular mcdonalds just sucks.
this is the last time i hit this mickey d's up again.
i tried to make my daughter an appointment to see the pediatrician.
i didn't even make it past the front office girls.
i guess we will just find another pediatrician that is more understanding.
i have come to this one a few times.
every time i go something is messed up.
the last time i came, no one gave me the soda i paid for.
i didn't notice until i got home.
i wrote an email to them and got no response.
definitely won't be retuning to this pizza hut.
spend your money somewhere else, even little caesars has better customer service than that.
i called to request a taxi around 8pm yesterday.
i waited on hold for close to 10 minutes.
the dispatcher who answered the call said, "madison taxi," and then silence.
not, "how can i help you?" or anything else.
there was radio silence.
my husband has really good coverage and they where in plan $20.
we wont begoing back there after that .
this place has the worst wings.
few years back my friends and i would frequent a few times a week.
but after the renovation before the fire.
the prices went up over 3 bucks for a dozen wings.
plus the wings are horrible, as if they get them from kfc.
i wish they would go back and purchase quality wings.
my advice, go to doc & eddy's in tempe.
those wings are amazing and only $8 per dozen.
order them grilled, you will thank me.
played a number of courses in the estrella area.
this is by far the worst.
dry dead grass, dusty trails and patchy greens.
had to take the compressor to clean all the dust out of my bag.
quit after 9 holes.
cheap but still not worth it.
made the mistake of eating here twice.
how clever)the bacon, the pancakes, and fresh squeezed orange juice were great.
the negatives above don't make it worth the extensive wait for a table.
i'll take ihop any day of the week over this silly place.
you do remember you're in scottsdale, right?
at this point i try avoiding boca park at all cost.
this target has seriously plummeted in customer service where they don't care about anything.
even as i'm shopping and i grab my stuff.
i will never shop at this target or questionably any of them again.
the employees don't bother with anyone.
they're just giving minimum service for their minimum paychecks.
$1 for a small line of tequila lime sauce?
are you kidding me?
this is the last time i come here.
lost a regular weekly customer.
should not get any stars, but pages make rater give one .
went to there order corner near the salad bar buffet.
needless to say i won't be returning to this place!
customer service is horrible...
you have to wait in three different lines to get your money back...
i made reservations online and i never recieved a confirmation email.
just left there 6:20 pm on 6/26/2018
this review is for the service dept.
we were lied to many times.
the work finally was done but we left unsatisfied.
definately losing my business for good.
worst experience i had in a restaurant.
first, the burger came little burnt.
horrible - avoid.
greasy food, low on taste.
i nearly choked on a metal staple in my food -- not kidding!
this however didn't figure heavily in my rating.
the owner stated," oops!
next time we will give you a free dish!".
i'll never return though.
you want decent dunkin donuts go to the one on route 51.
just walked out after waiting two hours for a chest x-ray.
unfortunately it is the only diagnostic test you can't make an appointment for.
what a disaster.
it's 11:30 in the morning, by the way.
gravy is good though.
this restaurant has the worst service in ontario!
the food wasnt that greathad rocks in my seafood linguine
the worst experience ever will never ever come back.
shame on them.
nice hotel bad management typical scammers.
try somewhere else!!!
i can't place this causal link for sure...but i'm definitely suspicious.
i really don't think it was the boba i had after.
waited 15 minutes without even being acknowledged.
at 3 other tables received attention.
too many options in vegas to put up with such poor customer service.
the lady signing me up assured me there were pools at other sites.
i have not found one and believe i was misled to make a sale.
i know the new laws for the vape stores.
i know you have to pay to sample 1.00 that's fine.
this snotty little man smirked and said no what tank do you use.
wtf did i do to you i didn't piss in your cherrios today.
i will never go back to that empty vape store.
they didn't even come and check up on me and my guest!
it was all about the money their!
they need to be closed down!
they did not work on the car for two days.
he actually cursed at my husband over the phone before he hung up.
never again...actually, they deserve 0 stars, not even one.
17 people waiting in line to rent cars, 2 counter attendants working!
i have sat in line for nearly 20 minutes already
i really liked this gym when i went there.
my whole family and i were longtime members.
refund checks were supposed to go out march 1st i believe.
it is now march 23rd and we still aren't refunded .
this is one of worst sushi bars i ever been too .
so 0$ tip for her .
the sushi was the most bland sushi i ever ate .
never going back again .
in other words , your customer service stinks buddy .
had to fire justin rodriguez because he was not taking care of my pool.
all-in-all, not a good experience.
the particular dish i ordered i've never received without rice elsewhere.
i obviously won't be going back.
his google review diverges greatly from yelp; peculiar and probably loaded.
i love korean food and this was a poor excuse for it.
tasted plain and i didn't even finish it.
never coming back :(
this store is completely user-non-friendly.
i have spent an hour on 2 occasions waiting to have help.
in each instance an employee with an ipad appears immediately to take one's name.
nothing like that today.
(btw, i am also a long-time, over 10 years sprint user.)
they are racist and have poor people skills.
will definitely not be going back.
i ordered the fish burger and sweet potatoe fries.
fish was not fresh and deep fried in old oil.
the tartar sauce was horrible.
sweet potatoe fries was ok, but you can tell it was frozen.
it didn't help that the oil was old.
never again....you are better off going to mcdonalds.
this is by far the worst dunkin i have ever been to.
i will be sure to travel farther for better service.
please avoid this dunkin at all costs.
the line is too long.
you have to wait an hour and a half just to order.
stay away until they learn how to run a business.
there is no way to eat here without waiting perpetually.
wow, so much bad food.
i would rather them have half the options and twice the quality.
i would avoid this place unless you don't mind bad tasting food.
probably the worst mcdonalds ever.
service is incredibly slow.
the manager was extremely rude.
overall, worst mcdonalds ever.
i purchased a groupon and was sorry the minute i walked in.
they were rude.
slow, surly, shoddy & expensive.
but it's shoddy that runs through.
i just came back with five shirts.
probably ok if these shirts were meant to be tucked in, but they aren't!
so i'm done.
all they could say is that its doordashes fault, not there.
he laughed and said there nothing he can do for us.
well you lost a customer tonight for your little laugh.
i ordered $1200 worth of baby furniture here.
over 3 weeks have passed now and nothing is in.
i'm glad that me paying the $1200 in cash got it "approved".
menu is misleading.
was a regular customer but will never be back.
patrons be ware!
worst food ever .
cod basically had no taste .
service was nice but stay away if you expect good food .
try doing that a few times to fix an just 1 issue.
i will now look for another company to do business with.
i ordered the premium bouquet and i got the bargain basement bouquet.
i ordered the love and laughter premium $79.95.
it looked nothing like the picture.
and when i complained by email they never even responded to me.
awful awful service.
really the worst!
i'm done with this place and never eating here again.
this place makes all the other sam woo chains look bad.
just had my first subzero experience.
while the experience was different/mildly entertaining,  the ice cream was beyond horrific.
worst $6 ever spent and worst ice cream i've ever had.
i was in a car accident and referred here from my chiropractor.
he said i can start taking 3 times a day instead of 2.
doctor basically told the staff to tell me to make it last.
why am i being blamed?
oh my god are you kidding me??!!!!!
i had the most rude lady today drawing my blood.
she told me to deal with it because nobody likes it.
what the hell??!!!
she needs to get fired asap!!
she bruised me pretty bad!
the food is so over-salted
i've tried this restaurant 3 times ordering 3 different dishes- outcome?
i wish i could give a 0 star review.
it was my first and last time ever ordering here.
i got the tonkatsu ramen and a lemon black tea drink.
the ramen soup just tasted like water and the egg was so overcooked.
would not reccomend this place at all.
our server seemed clueless.
i will go to another hooters and never to this one again.
definitely not recommending.
bad customer service.
lying theiving little sales guys.
no help from the manager.
you have so many other options.
take any of them but this one.
go to jack in the box.
the people here deserve to be out of work.
let me tell you what we did wrong - came to arby's!
my breakfast this morning was so nasty, i spit it out.
my egg and cheese biscuit tasted like cleaner and plastic chemicals.
it was absolutely the most disgusting thing i've ever tasted.
i honestly don't know why we continue to go to this location.
it used to be good, but every time we go now, it's subpar.
avoid yellow cab like the plague.
i'm required to take them around town because of insurance issues.
at times i've waited 90 minutes for a cab; other times no cab shows.
i've given up and, insurance money be damned, i call discount cab.
discount cab is always reliable and their drivers are helpful and courteous.
minus one star.
if you need a dependable towing company...then don't call these people.
waited 3 hours for this towing company to not show up.
they were 5 miles from our vehicle.
i could've pushed it to the shop.
middle finger's up!
first time ordering delivery and found 2 hairs in my pizza.
my wife then found the smaller one (beard?
pube?) on her slice.
i try to support small local businesses often, but this is just gross.
got a pedicure done here recently.
this was the second pedicure i had done there.
i wouldn't recommend this place to anyone at this point.
my relaxing pedicure experience was ruined because of this man not paying attention.
i will not go back
worst experience i have ever been through!
it's a scam!!
our salesman jeff took forever explaining pointless information to us!
needless to say it was 5 hours wasted!!
i wish i could give this place 0 stars!
i've come here twice and hated it both times.
everything about this is artificial with not a single real flavor or color.
diabetes in a cup.
the staff was nice.
seems like a lot of high school students work here.
they do a good job.
nice staff, but ugg on the unimpressive food.
if i could rate below zero, i would.
this place officially gets -11 in my mind.
the people are nice, but that's about all.
but i guess that's their version of express.
if you can find a different shop for your pedicure.
they only had a medium and verified the manicin had a size we wanted.
we are talking about a white t-shirt that had a blazer over it!
i was about 15 minutes late because i went to the wrong location.
too bad because it used to be a pleasurable experience.
so far not impressed   it's more like being in a disco bar.
she basically said no.
i come to a wine bar to relax.
not to be in a night club   call it what it is....night club.
all it's missing is the disco ball
my wife purchased tickets to this through groupon for our honeymoon in las vegas.
we followed all the directions as they were stated on their website.
two days had passed with no response whatsoever.
what kind of business does not accept phone calls?
thankfully, we were able to receive our money back through groupon.
1) the guy who "fixed" my phone, broke my iphone's camera.
2) the receiver dislodged and has fallen into my phone somewhere.
so wtf did this guy put on my phone?
and over priced, even for las vegas.
makes taco bell look like a fine dining establishment.
had a bad experience.
first no silverware, salsa bar was half empty and nothing looked fresh.
lots of dirty dishes.
my wife got her food i had to wait on mine.
think salt lick meets a sea salt grinder, then sprinkle some salt on top.
the issue is consistency- the food has never been consistent, other than consistently salty.
same with the drinks.
first time there, drinks were excellent- each time thereafter, not so much.
the associate over the phone said yes.
however if you want good food for a good price go somewhere else.
this buffet is large but the food comes right out of a can.
there is absolutely no taste.
so if you're looking for a good downtown buffet try the golden nugget.
you can't go wrong.
we pulled up, it was a very small place set back off the road.
no one was there on a saturday night except for us.
it was weird and i felt uncomfortable and didn't want to enter.
i didn't want it to be an awkward situation.
we ended up just ordering food from somewhere else.
poor first impression, not sure we will try it out.
do not live here.
after being a responsible tenant, they gave away my money.
policies and answers are not consistent.
they took no responsibility and basically told me it was my problem.
not worth all the headaches and dishonesty.
very unimpressed/disappointed with the service and product received.
when we brought up the 2hr window she said she couldnt do anything.
not very conveinent given a 4 hour ride thru the dessert.
will never use avis in las vegas again for the sheer fa
as of 9/25/14 this restaurant and their new one on gilbert road is closed.
called in my order at 5:15pm yesterday.
was told that my order would be ready in 25 minutes.
i was told it was only a few minutes and it would be ready.
finally got my food at 7:30pm.
now on i'll go to portofino's from now on.
won't get my business ever again
the staff treats you like you're a criminal.
i'm never coming back.
seriously, not worth it.
i would never  send a customer to this repair place again.
i would suggest not going to this place.
the service is terrible.
we had a coupon from the radio shopping show to try this place out.
they would not honor the coupon and ruined the night for everyone involved.
they lost my business forever.
in just a couple of words...
i wish i could no stars.
when i got a full set here two days broke the same day!
so i stop coming here.
my mom went in and waited 3-5 mins and no one even acknowledged her.
so rude and unprofessional.
why we keep going back is beyond me!
the sides took over 5 min.
to be served..
we're done !
this restaurant had terrible service.
there were 4of us and the entrees came out one a a time.
first entree came out before we finished our soup.
lazy waitress could refill our water.
not impressed and the food was horrible.
no stars on this one!!!
ladies steer clear of mollie the perm bee-ah-tch---bad bad bad!
what a smart mouth she has!
at the table and i haven't even left yet.
she ordered the manicotti and had one bite and didn't like it.
we asked the waitress if we could trade it out for something else.
and whenever we didn't like something they always replaced it.
no problem, excellent service.
the woman i talked to was very rude and showed no empathy.
it's a required medicine.
who knows if i'll be able to find someone or not.
the doctors may be great, i'll never know, but their office sucks.
all i can say is my father-in-laws tastes buds needs to be adjusted!!
i will choose freddys.
if i want a really good hamburger i will go to smash burgers!
still waiting here for almost an hour and there is no f***ing food.
not refilling drinks.
needs new management.
not sure how this place stays in business.
and it really is overly priced crap!
it's all put together very poorly!
shame on the company for bad business.
this will be the demise of their company if they don't change their ways!!!
i had one training class and the trainer left the gym.
i asked for a refund and they charged me three more months!!!!!
what a scam!
it has turned out to be the most expensive class ever !
if i could give this place no stars i would.
this was one of the worst experiences i have received.
i contacted them in regards to my complimentary consultation.
i do not recommend this office to anyone!
for that reason alone this place should be no stars.
and when it does- its all wrong and not to industry spec.
he is only here, to take your money.
so needless to say this has been a bad experience.
i work across the street and we've tried ordering from here several times.
i have yet to have a positive experience.
today, i placed a group order for pickup.
after picking it up, i realized they'd forgotten part of it.
when i called the person on the phone was very rude.
my previous experiences were similar.
the food is okay but the customer service is awful.
do not recommend.
do not eat here!!!
the food is cold!
health department should shut this place down.
no discount, or and help trying to fix the food problem.
what a rip off $40 for a cold lunch stay away!!
bad service and poor management.
we went to dinner for my birthday.
she then brought me walleye when i ordered perch.
as we exited, the manager expressed no concern.
we won't be going back for a long time, if at all.
i went here because of all the excellent ratings.
the staff was super nice and made me feel comfortable.
the computers were having issues that day and had problems with the xray.
so i never got to see why i was having tooth issues.
never gave me pain meds or anitbotics after i went twice.
im glad that everyone else got great care though.
super dirty and falling apart.
staff is a bunch of high school kids without an adult manager in site.
play gym has duct tape holding it together and metal pipes not covered properly.
never going back.
very disappointed, would not recommend ordering from this location.
plane is 5 hours late!
don't think i will choose this airlines again!
our food wasn't the greatest....
lacked flavor...(no seasonings) my ramen was sweet,hot and very little meat....
the other dish was plenty of beef yet still missing flavor!
went for breakfast!
food was horrible!
service was equally as bad!
if you want dry mashed potatoes this is your place!
pizza was terrible!
came burnt, which was clearly visible and they still delivered it.
i took my car here because it wouldn't shift into reverse.
then wanted $800 just to start digging into it.
i was warned about aamco, and how their service is shitty, they're scammers, etc.
anyway, needless to say i didn't let them touch it.
funny part, they said they offer a form of payment plans...baha.
was really excited to see mostly good reviews.
even tried going in person to show up to locked doors hours before closing.
very very verrrrry poorly ran establishment.
too much alcohol.
something has drastically changed at this facility in the past few months.
different staff and horribly different results.
he stated he couldn't do that as the manager was not there.
their current techniques will destroy pristine car finishes and nobody seems to care.
i would give 0 stars if possible.
the broth is weak and there's a funny taste in the meatballs.
the one on rainbow used to be one of my favorites.
the food quality and flavor have really slipped with the expansion.
much better pho one block either way.
waited 20 minutes, no food.
asked for refund, clueless front counter guy couldn't connect the problem.
3 others got refunds, two people in line were told the situation and left.
horrible horrible shipping service.
none of my neighbors have received it either.
i just want my textbooks!
who knows where they are.
my experience with junction optometrists has always been poor.
the two optometrists i have seen were excellent; helpful, competent and friendly.
unfortunately the pricing and the staff are way below par.
that's it for me, i won't be back.
btw, don't go in the bathrooms, they were really dirty.
imperial pub came highly recommended.
owner/manager is quite an asshole.
thanks for the recommendation, toronto.
many other places nearby without the violence.
the ladies at the gold member desk are rude and non professional.
i use to like hertz not anymore
i will not be doing business with das in the future.
there are a few good employees that i have dealt with....
this car rental place is horrible.
we reserved the car on expedia and the total was $280.
i've never been charged for an extra driver.
a real disappointment.
tacky decor too.
don't waste your time.
i told her it will take us 10 minutes to get there.
please, do not tell us there is actually space when there isn't!
outdated salon with rude,  horrible customer service.
i asked for a trim and the result was an uneven mess.
save yourself, and your hair, don't go here!
no one woke up so rather than disturb their sleep, we left.
for the price of this place, i expected much more!
the concierge was average at best and the decor was overly dated.
the hallways smelled old and looked worn.
i just don't get it.
i had the 35 day dry aged bone in ribeye.
it was chewy, fatty and not very flavorful.
there was an overpowering rosemary flavor.
while i enjoy the herb it was a flavor mismatch, in my opinion.
the steak was over cooked slightly but i dealt with it.
plus they give you duck fat fries.
skip this pedestrian steakhouse and go directly to stripsteak.
i have eaten here three times.
i ate there about 2 months ago and again it was just blah.
never going back.
i never thought i'd see the day when walgreens became classier than cvs.
this place used to develop photos, now it doesn't.
it's just like every other stupid, gross, overpriced and useless cvs in the valley.
this made an already difficult day worse than we could have ever imagined.
jason, you are right on the money!
scaife is part of the ultra-right-wing bunch.
and your tabloid comments are oh, so true.
i do give it two stars because its......oh, wait a minute....
can't think of a reason for two stars.
so i'll just give it one!
i will never, ever book with them again.
i purchased a ticket for $109 because it was the most affordable.
then, they charged for water on the plane!!
what in the hell?!
the bag and water, maybe you can rationalize it, but a seat?!
gimme a break, frontier.
unless there's a standing option, that charge is ridiculous and shady.
will never recommend and will strongly advise against them to family & friends.
my bicycle completely fell apart after service.
yikes, reading other reviews i realize my bad experience wasn't unique.
as a server i make a very laid back customer.
like other reviewers mentioned, he was frantic and made that clear to every customer.
you can either have bad service or bad food, but not both.
but this place would definitely not be my first choice after reading this review.
the pinnacle of sub-urban sprawl and needless consumerism.
he had to dig to find the leak.
mind you it had been dug pretty deep already.
for the digging alone he charged me $170.
we said no thanks and paid him for digging.
called in december to book an appointment, no call back.
called in january to make an appointment, no call back.
avoid at all costs!
they are just making false advertisements and don't want to help.
don't rely on the pictures they're using to promote their stuff!
there are tons of tuxedo rental shops in toronto, any other one is better!
run away far!
i went for lunch at 1:30pm.
ordered pho, which arrived less than a minute after i ordered.
not a good sign.
my fears then came true: the soup had zero taste.
i had to add a ton of hoisin sauce.
people who know their pho would never recommend a place like this.
temporarily closed,  tried to go tonight.
website doesn't mention the temp close which is why it's getting 1 star.
the door had a sign when i got there.
how effing dare this place call themselves mineo's pizza!
this is nothing more than a typical half-assed pizza milano.
they don't know how to plan, and run out by 6:15pm.
somebody please get this manager some supply management training!
try enterprise they are awesome
i have been a loyal customer in the past.
i recently purchased the $14.95 car wash package.
i am now an unhappy former customer!
planning to call bbb!!
worst experience of my life!
dr. thomas redid an old filling and chipped my tooth next to it.
had to go back to fix it.
he sliced my tongue on the drill.
i ended up having to go to another dentist to fix all his mistakes.
he left a filling to high and messed my bit.
he is very rude and unprofessional.
as soon as i sat down the waitress said you order now or leave.
i said i don't want it because of this.
well, hello to you too, mr rude-arrogant.
to make matters worse, the food was mediocre at best and very cold!
he should have just kept the food and given me a refund.
no, little man, there won't be another order from me.
they convinced me to get a gel overlay because it lasts longer.
i will not be returning.
the hotel is getting old.
stay at the palazzo if you have to stay at this property..
terrible just terrible.
the lady haven't cut any of my cuticle.
and applied nail polish just like a 5 year old would do.
on top of all of that she didn't apply the top coat even.
stopped in with my daughter to get pedicures for her birthday.
signed in and waited over 40 minutes.
license to print money.
xrays that were too blurry to see anything but still charged 230 dollars for.
ridiculous quotes off the top of a doctor or nurses head for minor surgery.
bad vibe here.
total tourist trap rip off!
food selections are way too small, dry, and not tasty at all.
i'd rather have happy meals for money wasted here.
there was nothing to "wow" you at this location.
even with a few extra $, venetian was better choice.
my original review was very positive i did enjoy my message from breida.
it's they only place where my eyes came in contact with anything.
this was unbelievable.
and the servers on duty at that time were walking around like zombies!
my hubs asked for medium well steak and got well done.
he didn't bother sending back.
employees socializing more amongst themselves instead of focusing on quality of service to customers.
very bad experience!
they don't even handwax.
time is money for some people, not for the one that assists you.
they don't know how to drive!
they are creepy and impolite!
uber quality standard is not the one in san franciso, ny or paris!
why is that???
i will never use this company nor this bank again.
wells fargo has lost another customer.
not like they care though
consumers beware rip off companythese guys are nothing but liars!!!!
well that was a big fat lie.
i am warning every trucking company i know about them.
the service is absolutely awful and it's not the bartenders fault.
they need to hire extra help for these poor employees!!!
no wait staff at all.
the same poor bartender is running his ass off with no help.
whoever the owner is....
you are an idiot
customer service at this location is such a joke.
i don't understand how this place is still in business.
all the reviews of bbq galore are horrible and everything is overpriced.
this place is a joke!
this place is ridiculous expensive!!!
experience eith manager very unprofessional.
order had four mistakes plus shortages when arriving home.
brice, the manager did nothing to correct this situation.
will not return to this location.
worst night club.
they ruined my birthday last night.
will never go back!
i was looking so forward to drais too!
one security guard there is a major hater.
my friend was just dancing with a dude and we got kicked out.
chicken had a terrible and dry taste.
the brisket was smoked for 2 minutes, if at all.
portion sizes are awful and they are not flavorful at all.
i threw the chicken away rather than taking it home to my dog.
i will never come here again or recommend it to anyone i know.
no we will not remove the comments.
fix the place.
das is not liable for undercarriage damage.
clearly, das did not take caution to avoid bottoming out.
their employee was rude over the phone.
one star is given for das emailing me to review them.
thanks for the reminder!
i ended up removing them, they came off in one piece!
like it was rubber.
i paid $40 for gel (including an extra $10 for matte).
what a disaster.
i wish i had pictures to show!
i'm just going to end this here before i get myself in trouble.
completely opposite of what we were told at the time of sale.
i would not recommend this store bc of the dishonesty.
sprint= sub par customer and phone service!
i ordered the "custom" table and had it delivered.
dr. knirk is completely incompetent.
accuses patients of faking.
lies right to your face.
i honestly have no idea how this "doctor" hasn't had her license revoked.
avoid at all costs.
gotta be the most ghetto place to rent a car.
cars are old and usually always have issues.
boooo, the worst.
if i could give them a negative star rating, i would.
who the hell wants to have 180 bucks in store freaking credit.
she was horribly rude and inconsiderate.
i couldn't stand talking to her.
this place is such a rip off and they take your money.
i will never be going back into a goodwill again.
this sugar factory sucks!
every single cake in the display case was damaged.
$21 dollars these people charge for what looks like a toddler decorated it.
i have officially learned from my mistake.
they assured us they assured us they would not run out of drinks beforehand.
well they did, during the drink hour before the reception.
they were given money to get more.
then ran out again, and were given more money to get more.
they threw it away while cleaning up.
this place is awful.
an appointment to order a battery!
are you serious?
worst company ever
slow slow slow...
1 person working the desk.
all the other companies around the desk are empty.
there were other tables being taken care of but we just kept getting overlooked.
horrible service won't go back.
these guys cancelled my reservation after i checked-in online.
the manager looked very confused.
turns out they were not sold out, rooms were available.
this shows just what platinum elite status with marriott will get you.
i've stayed 89 nights with marriott in the last year.
it means nothing to them.
my food was good, the service was less than desirable.
asked a few times for mustard never showed up with it after.
not a good first time.
not sure we will be back
his store has some shady practices.
the employee suggested a box, without naming price.
i agreed and was surprised the box rung up as $6.30 (17x17x8).
i then saw a 2.85 and 3.41 service charges i was not informed about.
so it cost me 37.21 to send a package whose shipping was only 23.99.
what type of price gouging is this?
i usually use my locally owned shop, where customer service is top rate.
this was my second (and final) visit to this subway.
major sad face!
service was ok, but my steak was overcooked and the potatoes gratin undercooked.
rude and unprofessional.
steak lesson: the steak has to have the same thickness to cook properly!
never going back, never recommending to anyone.
i recommend using priceline or any other internet rental application to rent a car.
this same car was available at your competitors for $10 a day!
the referral to this place was a first and a last!!!
i expected way more from enterprise.
food is very good but service is very bad.
sad that a restaurant values there customers so little that they turn them away.
shame on them!
quite possibly the worst chase in vegas.
15ppl in line on a holiday friday and you have one teller open.
i promise to close my account with chase with suck horrible customer service.
oh yeah tried the drive up and rang the bell 5 times.
the parrots are disgusting.
they are noisy, dirty, and one even will curse at you.
as far as yoli's.
they blamed it on a large party being there and not even grill space.
i would never go there again!
worst south indian food in the charlotte area.
we wanted to try a new restaurant in the area.
should've gone to peacock instead, as we'd planned to.
shitty place with shitty service and bad attitude employees...
i rush this wasnt the closest
this restaurant is a celebration of complete mediocrity.
the sides included rice, beans, chicken soup, and a few other equally bland choices.
first timers and the service is terrible.
then we didn't know of their limited menu for sunday.
will not be back
took bike to cervelo authorized retailer, who refused to help.
contacted cervelo and received a short note saying its not covered.
very disappointed with customer service from the cervelo shop and with cervelo headquarters.
do not recommend purchasing their bikes.
many other great brands with better customer service, who stand behind their bikes.
i had a bed delivered last may!
have eaten a battista's in the past.
the security gate which made this place appealing is broken, had been for months.
i have seen cars drive in casing the place for robbery.
beat up car, two suspicious looking characters driving in and then right back out.
management never returns calls, ever.
i would have recommended it in the past but not anymore.
think i am looking for a new office!!!
we don't mind paying the pricey prices but the service was horrible.
an employee with green hair was talking tattoos with someone else for so long.
i would have walked but my wife wanted the juice.
next time, i will pay a taxi to take me elsewhere
well i'ma be honest i stayed there for a year and two months.
kids run all around the complex very loud.
the location though accessible for this area has its own share of issues.
go here only if you need to.
thanks, hero burger, for giving me food poisoning and keeping me up all night.
not worth the 7 dollars.
worst hamburger i have had.
fake butter flavor on it.
had the applitizer.
so much salt on it.
tried scraping salt off.
still way to much.
wouldn't give it one star if i could.
baked beans were from a can, potatoes, blah, and the ribs were inedible!
hope the health department visits this place soon!
my experience with this scam of a company was just like everyone elses.
then magically i received a call right away.
this is 100% an illegitimate insurance company and this guy is a career criminal.
ill be renting from another company next time
lots of issues from this company.
but he did not.
details are very long and i don't have the time to get into it.
avoid at all costs!
i had new brakes put on my truck.
they squeaked but i figured there would be a break in.
i brought my truck back to see what they could do.
should have gone to a real mechanic.
food was not good.
it was more like a 4.
the end result was a chopped up mess that was obviously uneven.
no wonder they were half empty on a saturday!!!!
not the best restaurant for a vegan newbie.
your options are pretty bad for lunch.
i went for lunch, and they barely had anything on the menu.
customer service isn't so good.
both times there were about 10+ empty tables.
we work less than a mile away and used to come here.
rico, the bartender, was awful.
horrible car wash the last few times i've been there.
i had an empty cup in there from dutch bros.
and they didn't even bother to toss it out.
no scent which was part of the package either.
very bummed out about the quality of the furniture made by this company.
my husband and i bought a bed 3 months ago.
it is now falling apart because of the cheap way it was made.
i also bought 2 leather reclining sofas.
i was planning on remodeling our whole house with living spaces.
after getting up to see what was going on i saw half dressed females..
continental breakfast is a joke as well it's a dump period....beware......just saying...
this business has closed.
it was a cute little shop if you caught them open.
i had the same experience as others but i lived close by.
guess that's why they went out of business.
they never did show up and continued to send me rude texts.
we have been here before and it was good.
today we watched the cook cough and hack all over our food while cooking.
it is an open kitchen so you can watch them cook.
no attempt to turn away from the food or cover his mouth.
it was really bad.
we left and cancelled the food.
the waitress and very nice.
beware of the cook
too many items on the menu for a 1 woman show to do well.
new ownership and no more alex.
service went way down.
i'm not sure about the food.
we ordered two blinds and they both were supposed to be bottom-up/ top-down blinds.
both were incorrectly ordered.
definitely won't go back here.
went to buy juice earlier tonight.
i think acting like this will make you lose your business one day .
i will never go into your shop again.
there are other places who provide the same service with a smile .
nit with a nasty face you make .
the most expensive  mid grade sushi i've ever had.
it's empty for a reason.
4 iced teas later 150 dlr bill.
this is theft.
won't be back to this location.
do not book through this service!
we arrived early (noon) had we booked direct we could have checked in.
i'm sure this isn't the only disadvantage we will discover.
don't do it!!!!
the worst experience of my life.
cut my hair extremely short and gave me bangs with out asking.
would not recommend anyone to go here.
i just ordered a hennessy on the rocks and the bartender said $20.
he said, "hen on the rocks!
he said for two hennessy's on the rocks, it was $33.
i'm no mathematician, but i know that shit don't add up!
i've been to this restaurant twice.
both times the nachos were terrible!
the cheese was like chewing a rubber tire both times.
the wait staff are not observant at all.
recently the waitress just got our order incomplete or wrong.
i've given this place two tries and will never return!
the hours are posted and they are never here.
they also never answer their telephones.
don't waste your time and money on such a.
u professional place.
i bought a 60-minute massage session from groupon.
i walked in 5 minuets before my 10 am appointment.
the massage therapist gave me some paperwork to complete.
by the time i finished forms and got undressed, it was already 10:15 am.
but there was absolutely no reason to cut me short at the end!!!
i will never go back there again
the drinks are watered down and over priced.
the sushi is lack luster.
website states that weekend champagne brunch is friday-sunday.
i even called before but the wait was so long that i gave up.
recently, the service has been quite the opposite.
about a month ago, i went here to buy some ice.
thanx and i hope this help to anyone who reads it.
everything about the rental experience was a fail.
on a sunday afternoon.
these cars are cheap and available for a reason.
it does not have 24 hour delivery.
tried to order but they would not deliver because of the time.
the worst food i have had in vegas in 15 years !!!
not very good.
the customer service was ok but the pizza was burnt.
and it wasn't cut properly!!
lame won't be back
what a sad place with the worst "management".
never ever was my eye brow waxed so bad.
she doesn't seem to understand instructions nor english.
this is like days before my wedding.
i don't think i will ever come back.
not even deserving of 1 star.
you changed the tv's go multiple stations before.
lying to your guests, no flexibility?
seriously not after the customers satisfaction older gentlemen manager with nose in ipad.
i was over drawn 600 plus dollars .
what's the concept?
use apteka as a baseline for the quality and price point of your food.
the whole earthy to be earthy idea never got me anywhere.
hope you reopen with a better plan.
this spot deserves something special!
joke of a guacamole.
i ordered the steak quesadilla which is supposed to come with guacamole.
they use 2oz souffl cups to dispense it.
they barely filled it up 1/4 of the way.
stop being so cheap!
oh and the tartar sauce looked liked it had been sitting out for awhile.
i've been incredibly sick since eating here.
ate it because i was in a hurry.
was here with a group of 11 for lunch.
many complained to me that their lunch wasn't good.
on the upside, it is cool decor inside.
service was decent and friendly.
however, the vegan food here is way overpriced, tasteless, and just plain boring!
for $65 a person (no drinks included) i expected a lot higher quality.
never stay here!!
i checked in on monday into a cigarette smelling room.
then was moved to another room.
they're housekeeping team literally went into my closet and stole my luggage!!!!!!
i'm outraged and now out my luggage !!!
never coming back here again
came back tonight cos, well i'm stupid.
ordered take out.
spicy salmon maki with a side of saliva.
definitely not coming back now.
this one is not one of those.
and the kitchen staff was rude ...
one girl went and turned up the music for no reason.
the nurses and doctor seemed more interested in bickering than helping my kid.
i'm avoiding dignity like the plague from now on.
they all look like they hate their life.
i love taco bell, but damn are they making it difficult.
love this place but had really bad service a few weeks ago.
had the worst bloody mary of my life!
paid $10 for an overpriced bland salad.
they could have at least grilled the damn chicken.
tastes like it's right out of the fridge
how did this place get two stars?
this is one of the worst golf courses i have played.
please go any were but here.
i will never go back.
i am from texas and i know barbecue and this is the worst.
do yourself a favor and drive up the streets of scottsdale to bryan's.
fortunately for them there is very little competition that is not 20 minutes away.
we came in today at 8.
they don't close till 9.
cause he did t wanna clean the machine again.
why would you stop serving an hour before you close?
when people know you for burgers and shakes.
oh and then the bill came!
sure try it!
who the f*** gave this place 5 stars?
i deleted my yelp app after trying this place out.
food taste like s***.
yelp sucks donkey d*** lately with fake reviews.
the lady took my order without writing it down.
got my order wrong 2 times.
the seafood pho my wife ordered looked like s***.
f***** pho nasty msg is what they should call this place.
they are un-ethical.
they charge you for extra for stuff you did not want.
then they do nothing about it when you talk to them.
if you can go with someone else, you would be wise to do so.
my turkey burger was almost inedible.
husbands burger was dry and tasteless.
cheap glasses and accessories.
not worth the price at all.
the worst set up for a play structure.
what the hell were they thinking??
no one came out to greet us for 10 min.
not that i want to eat somewhere that is so unwelcoming and rude.
beware, they actually close at 8:30pm.
samantha, the manger, should be terminated.
insulting and arrogant are a bad combination.
greeted warmly by the half  hammered owner but downhill from there.
waited 2.5 hours for cold entrees.
that got his immediate attention.
there is a no-tipping policy on my next check , just so you know.
then we will be back to even.
i would nvr go back .
the lightened wasn't even that great .
scam  leave you holding the wet bag.
i can't even call it mediocre.
the food was terrible.
not worth the comps...definitely not worth the price.
if you are in a hurry, do not come here!!
worst customer service, no one is ever behind the counter!
and the sandwiches taste like crap.
dont come here
i am very surprised that the food here was awful, given the location.
chicken was indercooked and under spiced, yet still tough.
the service was prompt.
next time, i will go back to the dundas and hurontario area.
very deceptive, cash does not give you the cash price.
cash and credit are the same high price.
you must buy the extra car wash with cash to get the cash deal.
last time to go here.
go across the street to fry's and save.
gun range closed.
all the signs and advertisements we saw said open 7 days a week 9am-7pm.
wasted lyft ride and an hour.
disappointed, employees just cleaning, no one available to give us a ride.
we can't eat these due to our particular diet.
when we pointed this out to the manager she did nothing.
my husband and i were in town for a vacation.
googled about this place.
the first thing we ordered was thai tea.
it had a cockroach in it.
we just left.
forced to use them again because of fidelity home warranty company.
once again they came and "fixed" the problem.
only to return again and fix the problem.
they never came back and we spent the day/night with no ac...summer...in vegas.
house is now complete and we're back in the house totally again.
i go back assuming the poor weld would be covered, nope!
i work in the industry and this place disappointed me.
they let us in 20 min before close and we all ordered bowls.
15 min before close.
this was a terrible experience and i have loved this place in the past.
i purchased a voucher on groupon for a 60 minute deep cleansing custom facial.
had appointment at 11am this morning.
great business  practice...not!!!
what a corrupt seating system.
came here for dim sum on chinese new year and the restaurant was packed.
taking a number means nothing at this restaurant because numbers never get called.
decided to leave after waiting almost two hours and complaining multiple times.
definitely will not be returning.
the worst car rental experience from customer service perspective (actual car worked fine).
do not use them.
horrible customer service.
added on extra charges to final invoice so no longer a low rate.
hassle to deal with from start to finish.
this place tried to put me in the hospital.
she assured me no problem we deal with that all the time.
i called and she got mad at me and then hung up on me.
i had to go to quick care and get a shot.
they have no respect for their customers!
my one star review is based on my experience with reservations.
i arrived to be told they never take reservations on the patio.
this place needs to get their story straight.
charged $225 for 30 minutes work just replacing a gfci.
then wanted $8 to be paid with a credit card.
rip off and very unprofessional office staff.
horrible customer service.
the hostess "assumed" we wouldn't want to sit at the bar.
the hostesses disregard of saying "sorry" is not excusable.
when i come to charlotte i always looked forward to coming here.
was set up with the shop's visiting artist, dixer.
terrible customer service.
i decided to go to another tattoo shop to get this fixed.
the artist there couldn't believe what a sloppy job was done on my arm.
if i could give these unprofessionals negative stars then i would.
i went to a local repair shop and was informed the screen was defective.
he wanted me to mail the screen back to him.
avoid this place at all costs!!!
i've never contacted this company before...
i've never even heard of this company before.
if you go here do not see fabio!!
just a warning.
he is a liar and sneaky car salesman.
i don't even know if he still works there.
i bought my car so long ago but there were sooo many issues.
i don't feel like typing them all there were so many problems.
do yourself a favor and find another toyota dealership.
today was our first visit to wahoo's.
the chicken tacos had 2 pieces of horrible chicken and tons of cilantro.
much better food.
first time at this osmow's and ordered a medium half & half chicken shawarma.
portion was a lot smaller than i expected.
for $9.25 + tax i expected more.
i asked for mild and got 3 little dots of hot sauce.
for this price they could've at least given me a full line.
i ordered it to-go so i didn't know until i got home.
garlic sauce was good - that's about it.
i won't be back (at least not to this location)
staff is rude.
no response at all from them.
won't ever be going there again.
this place is a joke.
i was absolutely disgusted with their service and their inability to paint nails correctly.
terrible customer service.
he told me that it could be done today.
don't trust what you hear on the phone i guess?
thank you spartan arms for helping me whittle down my gun store choices.
poor service at best.
having to triple check my bag is the new thing apparently...
no cinnamon twists either.
offered me tap water when he said there was no more baja blast though...
this place is straight bull.
first messing up my account and not even giving a refund for their mistakes.
worst customer services in any gym i've been too.
the lady lied to her boss saying i ordered plain burgers.
you need better employees.
ones that do the job right.
never coming here again.
i don't understand what the whole rave is about.
if burritos were like this nobody would ever eat them.
there are so many other places in the city which are much much better!
chipotle or makes much better burritos.
so does burrito boys and big fat bastard burrito.
pretty much any other burrito place trumps this hole in the wall.
the sound quality is extremely bad.
it has nothing to do with the settings.
it is the bad quality speakers.
again i asked them not to contact me again.
i received another call in february then a letter i march.
this is nothing more then harassment!
if you like getting harassing phone calls i recommend this medical office.
being a chandler based company myself, i think that max.
i am arizona born and raised, and a chandler based business owner.
don't ever do business with maximum title loans !!!!!!
took 25 min to get a salad and grilled cheese.
asked for slaw, got tater tots.
will never eat here again.
i'm a big junior fan but this sucked.
only 2 people working during the 5pm hour.
line kept growing as i was waiting.
both employees were slooow.
during my time waiting the health code violations just kept adding up.
as a chef i just couldn't stand it.
great ceasar salad that can be eaten according to  tim the manager.
put bread in the plate that was hard as a rock.
later was said to be a bowl ...
i guess in a bowl ..
atmosphere and waitress was great.
poor excuse for a cease r salad
poor service and food was mediocre at best.
when we arrived at 11:20 it was packed.
there were hundreds of people outside, i was not expecting that.
the workway in scottsdale is no better.
very unprofessional and not organized at all.
terrible listening skills and rude.
not a good job at pedicure.
will never come back!
please think twice when buying a pet from petland!
when your dog has sensitive stomach you can't just switch to another kind.
i was extremely disappointed by this location.
i had appointments scheduled at 130, 2 and 215 for myself and children.
i arrived at 115 to complete paperwork.
i'm incredibly disappointed with this facility and their lack of promptness.
prices aren't too great for what you get.
actually, the food isn't even that good, period.
only time i ever think to come here is if i want asada fries.
but then i remember how terrible the staff is, and my craving subsides.
the worst salon experience ever!!
if you are not part of it you get really second class treatment.
left salon at 2.30.
went outside with wet hair, they did not offer to dry my hair.
store is closed.
i came in withy the intention of purchasing a 60 inch tv.
the one i was looking at was $1500.
definitely the most wrinky-dink operation i've ever seen.
vegas never sleeps, but getting shuffled around at 2:45 am is moronic.
spend your $50 elsewhere.
these companies are hit or miss either way.
i had to take it back and waited another two days.
defiantly will never return to this car was again.
we went for dinner on a monday night.
we waited over an hour for the sushi.
we only received half of our order.
never received our drinks.
terrible service and customer service.
will never go back.
our room was never cleaned - even though we were gone 8am until midnight.
one of the staff members verbally abused my friend throughout the night.
a long, odd and uncomfortable story.
the manager never bothered to return the message i left her highlighting these issues.
usually i love carl's jr. but not this one.
went there for the first time and will not go back.
place is outdated, dirty, & staff was not friendly.
will not go back.
this place is suuuper cheesy looking.
from the outside, it looks as if this place has closed down.
keep this in mind when considering coming here
she did not want to eat it any more after taking five bites.
do yourself a favor, stay away from coconut grove.
as for me...i'm moving!!
so at 1:00 a.m i was expecting very little wait.
sorry, i got a little sidetracked there.
to recap, on my honeymoon, i reserved a challenger, left in a minivan.
i strongly recommend anywhere but here.
i now know better.
i stayed here with my boyfriend for four days.
the real kicker was that the customer service is crap.
beware: behind every smile is a lie.
i am not even kidding.
had a horrible experience with this place.
rude management and the worst service.
plenty of better options in town.
disgusting food alert!
i am now concerned that i might be food poisoned....
waited an hour or more for every single appointment.
i asked for a number ten medium spicy nuggets.
learn how to to do your job !!!!
as a customer how do i know that's how your system works
went to get a shake and requested no whip cream.
the lady comes out and it has whip cream on it.
she comes back in no time at all.
poorly i might ad.
apparently actually putting effort into fixing the shake was too much to ask.
she rushed through my whole fill.
i simply rubbed it and my polish peeled off.
they also say a fill is $15 i paid $30.
i was just so frustrated i didnt question it and just paid and left.
so disappointed with the job she did.
stay away from this garbage!
their cloud service sucks, customer service sucks and they will not honor warranty!
2 months cam quit working after firmware upgrade.
they are morons!
stay away from them
rude bouncers and hostesses.
we left and ate at another olace around the corner.
i will never return and i definitely don't recommend this place.
theft theft theft.
this is a very shady operation.
horrible, horrible horrible.
if you want to see your valuables again, do not use this company.
i will update with the other names this company uses.
they do this to try and disguise their bad reputation under different company names.
it's not worth the price that i pay for dinner.
i would not come here if i was you.
this is going to be my last time here.
the food was mediocre.
pasquale is incapable.
the place is really big and has some nice tvs inside.
the food and service on the other hand were awful.
after tasting the wrap it tasted how i imagine cardboard would taste.
the chicken was really dry, the wrap was really hard to chew.
overall i highly recommend not going here.
so, this place is no longer my fav.
that is just weird and could lead to an unsanitary situation.
be a little cleaner people please
wenr last week for the montreal tbl citywide food festival.
well you'd think that they would put they're best foot forward.
the service was teriible.
i waited a good 10 minutes before anyone came to the table .
another 10 mins for bread and water .
the food was just so so.
we visited this location today.
i wanted ljs,  my wife wanted taco bell.
we went across the road to popeye's,  where they seem to value customers.
the manager at this taco bell/long john silvers should be talked to.
where are the bartenders?
or is it the severs?
i would give this place zero stars if i could.
absolute rip off.
rude and blatantly disrespectful to customers.
we wound up paying way more than what we signed up for on line.
paid over $600 for a car that was originally supposed to be around $265.
my fault for signing....should have just walked away.
phoenix does have extremely high taxes...but be very careful..
never, never again.
almost got fired from my work!
worst service ever
you'll get better sleep in a motel 6.
the ceiling creaks like the place was built in the 50s.
first time eating there for a late breakfast...
and everything was just not up to par!
nothing was fresh...
insane way to do business.
waited in line 2.5 hours for a reserved car at phoenix sky harbor.
i was so distraught we had to leave right away.
please do not ever eat here.
i've been conned twice from them.
last year and just recently.
don't do it or you'll make the biggest mistake of your life.
my mistakes is your gain and i hope you take my advice.
i'm fighting the battle to get my money back.
i just resigned my lease earlier this month for another year.
i really regret my decision to stay.
i would never recommend this as a place to live to anyone.
thank goodness his father still lives at that address!
and the guy hung up on him!
poor customer service, poor employees, and terrible bank in general.
the pasta and omelet stations are the only things worth eating here.
the staff is tired and hagard.
the buffet island could really use some customer service training.
avoid unless you have free passes.
decided to see what the famous galley boy was all about.
the sandwich was made sloppy and was dry.
the best thing i had was the chocolate shake.
i would subtract stars for this location.
the downtown mesa location is like another restaurant.
it is almost false advertising to call this pete's!
no messy fish sandwich?
are you kidding me?
that's like no big mac at mcdonald's!
do us all a favor and close this joke of a restaurant!
please comment and follow me for more reviews!
i would love to have you!
we waited for an hour only to be given a cold bibimbap.
had to walk out cause we didn't want to eat other people's leftovers.
seems to be pretty poorly run.
i will update if they happen to show up with a good explanation.
read the comments the the gm  put and he's  full of it.
your shop is the worse i have seen in 15 year.
this one will ben you over.this place is more like -1.
don't order anything other than the creps.
everything else is too over priced for the microwave quality food.
oh and their juices suck too.
the orange juice had a hint of rotten.
don't even ask how much i paid for that, you'd call me stupid.
came to arizona and purchased a groupon for my nails.
groupon was great and refunded my money but that's horrible customer service.
i would have come back but they were unwilling to work with their customers.
this is the worse service ive ever had to deal with.
it wasnt busy at all!!!!!
it was almost good until we ordered our food.
not my cup of joe.
the first time i went there the staff was customer service stunt.
the second time i went there the service was plain jane.
big yawn to urban beans !!!

do not take your dog here, since they have no regard for well being.
also no attempt to try to rectify the situation.
my mothers day experience here was very disappointing.
our server was very uptight, unfriendly and not very customer oriented.
server was less than mediocre and food was still cold internally.
however i will make the exception when in bullhead city.
and they're uneven!

unless you all changed your business hours, there should be someone by the phone.
you lose customers this way.
come on psh get your stuff together.
worst place to live.
ac problems all the time and the toilets are always clogged.
at the end of the day management will blame you for your loss.
never ever think of "the meridian condos"

i requested it online and made an appointment.
i got here and they said they don't do typhoid immunizations here.
she said i shouldgo somewhere else...so i did.

they should have at least gave a free candy bar or something!
decided to give tokyo express another try after being recommend by a coworker.
i would place my order and asked her for "white meat only".
she said very rudely " yeah, yeah i know".

food: just another pei wei.
this is not chinese food and it is drowned in salty sauce.
service: friendly but only one waiter on a sunday just couldn't keep up.
we nervously stand around for around 10 minutes or so.
considering i didn't even get served i would give zero stars if possible.
extrmement du par la qualit du service, si on peut appeler cela du service.
le vendeur ne laisse aucune alternative sur aucuns autres modles et prodigue aucuns conseils.

i've left too many messages to count.
no one has responded to any phone calls i've been making.
that's not right.
wholefoods is already overpriced and making the dish smaller too is not helping.
i used to have the dish for lunch and dinner on occasion.
now i refuse to pay the same price for 1/2 the product.
ok really bad service..
no one greeted us..
so we walked to the bar and still nothing..
we ended up walking out ..
i yelled out thanks!
never coming here again!
i ordered a cake for my wife's birthday.
when i went to pick it  up it wasn't made.
the manager pretty much told me there wasn't anything she could do about it.
i refused to spend another cent at this establishment!
he said it may finish before 12:00.
but we wait till 3:30pm.
i ask other car repair store.
it should be done within 2 hours.
he has really discrimination on foreigner.
so pay attention!!
basically told my boyfriend to shut up so she can talk to me.
i mean this lady asked for my email and couldn't even spell out cloud!
end of story i would not go back to this place ever again.
(short black hair,hispanic,long unprofessional black nails).
the food is fine.
we concerned about the environment a lot.
there is some bug crawling on the wall when we were eating.
the girl taking the order in the drive-thru is very rude.
i even felt her spit on my arm when she was talking...
it was disgusting!
if so, come here!
i'm amazed at the horrific service.
do yourself a favor and go anywhere else.
they open at 10.
i showed up at 10:30 and they still had nothing ready.
it was ridiculous...
will not be back to this location because of the bad service.
i would give this 0 stars if i could
then there was not tater sauce who serves fish with out tarter sauce.
short and sweet, please do not spend your money here.
i have never felt so uncomfortable walking into a store.
boooo audio express.
absolute worst haircut my dog has ever had!!
worst $48 i've ever paid!!
horrible, wouldn't recommend to anyone with half a brain.
the girl who did my nails couldn't even hold a conversation.
i wish i could give it 0 stars.
the worst !
very dirty inside.
disorganized, stacks of papers, dishes,equipment everywhere.
floor is sticky, bugs on the ground, cobwebs everywhere.
i literally asked for a refund and left.
you won't be disappointed!
we got in and ordered our food, we ate and it was decent.
by far one of the worst experiences i have ever had.
the fries were over cooked.
absolutely the worst!
finds somewhere else to eat.
we were extremely disappointed in our visit wednesday morning.
we went for breakfast but had to pay the holiday brunch rate.
sorry, never again.
slow service with quite possibly the smallest water glasses ever.
burger was $22 and over cooked.
would love to give more stars but what a cheapass place.
ordered a milkshake at 7:59, by the time it arrived it was after 8:00.
they are offering their half price shakes after 8:00.
the customer service at this location was a joke.
i wouldn't recommend this place at all to anyone.
the salon is tiny, the size of my bathroom.
the owner rapheal is rude; egotistical and obnoxious!
his attitude is disgusting.
salons like this should not exist in service industry.
do not go!
she tried telling me she didn't touch her face and could replace my mango.
i asked her to make the entire drink over.
super small servings.
hopefully they will get it together.
im not sure if i will ever go back to this location ever again.
a dirty, crowded hole in the wall, filled with hipsters.
we got there around 9:00, and left at 12:30 without even singing one song.
will not return.
i had to call my ac man to come fix the problem.
i felt belittled by manny himself
chicken and shrimp over cooked no popeyes sweet tea or jambalaya.
not a great popeyes restaurant.
good beer selection.
worst customer service ever.
une des choses les plus importantes pour moi est: le service  la clientle.
et le bar n'tait pas plein du tout.
la serveuse etait dsagrable avec une attitude hautaine.
tout a t compliqu.
le menu des drinks tait collant et sale.
bref plus jamais j'irai  cet endroit.
we ordered the borani and the gulpi.
the borani was smothered in yoghurt which left little else to taste.
gulpi was bland.
pita slices were stale.
would not recommend
i won't return and will find another psychiatrist to prescribe meds.
so unnecessary- just nasty.
worst service...huge rip-off!!
canada junk removal inc.
i now hesitate to use their services again with our unused coupon.
incredibly rude employees who shouldn't be allowed to work in customer service positions.
i will be contacting the corporate office about this awful treatment.
i'm absolutely appalled by this behavior.
but i guess mr frank likes the 20 bucks tips only.
blamed me for everything saying that i started the accident.
proved with documentation and statement saying that i was not at fault for accident.
what company in their right mind would do that.
jeremy morgan, erika javier, meritza - you guys are extremely unhelpful.
made senseless claims regarding my accident and antagonized me for asking questions!
get out of the customer service industry and learn to treat people nicer!
i have always loved capriotti's, but this store is horrible!
had to go back not once, but twice and the order still wasn't right!
they can't even get your order right.
i wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.
the emergency care center sent my amox script here, near my home.
only after i arrived did they realize they were out of stock.
sure, i need the medicine.
told it'll take 45 minutes.
off i go to cvs.
they call the 16th, transfer the script and fill....all within 15 minutes.
guess where i'm going in the future.
guess where i'm not.
some of the worst food i've had in a really long time.
gross feeling to bite down on that.
plus, for a half sandwich, half salad, and drink it cost almost $17!!!
don't waste your time or money here!
the cleaning devices pick up impurities over the course of the day, week, month.
1 speck of sand will make the design impractical for newer cars.
the wash will also remove wax and help you discover deeper problems.
we literally walked in and walked right out.
the line up was completely disorganized and people were very agitated.
really surprised to see a multi-billion dollar company with a location this badly managed.
not allowed in because of shoes?
come on man.
the website says casual dress.
all these other people are allowed to come in with sandles, flip flops ect.
this place sucks and i wouldn't recommend to anybody.
came here for dinner on a sunday evening.
the place was busy but we were seated within an appropriate amount of time.
not really a place to go to for quality rolls.
great place if you are looking for a cheap meal.
the quality of the hotel is beyond disgusting.
but the pee smell prevailed!
everything is outdated and rusty and old and broken.
i can't believe i paid for my family to stay here.
**you've been warned**
good service, but below average food.
at the salt cellar i ordered a rib eye steak.
there was absolutely no seasoning on my steak...
unfortunately, it made our experience a disappointment and we won't be back.
went to the ac/dc concert there.
great band, great music.
downsview is an awful venue.
poorly thought out and poorly executed - never going back.
many people are not friendly here.
they are very pushy.
just go elsewhere.
i figure -- whatever, let them come and clean.
i already got my refund!
go figure -- they're late.
just avoid these people at all costs.
their lack of professionalism is astounding.
if i could no star i would.
when we finally got to the window it atilla wasn't even right.
it ended with us completely cancelling our order and leaving.
seriously we order two meals...
a number one and 20$ fill up and they couldn't even get it right.
all i wanted was to defeat my kfc craving...
well thanks kfc you did that without even feeding me!!!
sucks this is the closest one to me.
avoid this place if you can.
their food isn't good and their service is really bad.
i ordered noodles with roasted pork.
the noodles didn't taste like anything and the pork was salty and cold.
the servers were also rude.
you'd be better off spending your money elsewhere.
who knows what's going on but obviously i'm being shafted.
went to eat today with my family and it was a bad experience....
my food was cold on top of that...
so not worth the money that i payed...
done going to this place.
all the servers were really polite about their screw ups though.
i'm so very disappointed.
or a hygienist.
i'm beyond disappointed 2 chances to wow me.
two total flops    i'm done
food is so low quality ...
execution also lacking.
it's like a motel brunch ..
not what i expected from bellagio.
cheese plate was a joke.
"small" plates were so unsatisfying.
i did not receive my drink.
my yellow curry was only 1/2 full.
don't order here.
the restaurant did refund my drink.
terrible customer service.
not one employee would acknowledge me.
needless to say i made my purchases at the "big box store"
1st time at this location.
ordered a $3.99 chili to go.
small cup not even half filled.
i showed employee and was told thats stardard amount.
what a rip off for a $3.99 chili.
plus it's a high traffic area.
hard to park.
i'll stick with wendys.
very bad service and rude.
got a haircut i didn't want.
they did not listen to me and told me to leave!
never come back again!
i wish i could give this company a zero!!!
they are unresponsive, unprofessional and the veracity of their employees is highly questionable.
don't waste your time with them.
if your home warranty company refers you to them, request another company.
the service was discriminatory.
please don't tell me that it was based on skin color...
who on earth do you think you are?
all the rest is so average & disgraceful.
nothing of the elegance of italy, over cooked pasta and the prices.
scottsdale at its finest.
and the sound..
your hipster architect has no idea how to buffer sound?
i would pass on cox cable.
after two months i gave up today and moved to a different provider.
not only is the office personnel rude but the dr.
every single person in line was pissed and complaining.
not to mention, it was burned.
our food took forever and she rushed through the order.
it too was cold when we actually sat down to eat.
the tortilla was already soggy.
and damn the steak was nasty.
chewy, beef jerk like meat that had more fat and tendons than anything.
i will update my review when and if they turn it around.
they lied to me about work that needed to be done.
told me i needed a gasket replaced, i did not.
i was quoted $601 for all the work to be done.
i told him my stepdad would look at it and he encouraged it.
ok where can i start.
i've been craving this place for months and finally decided to order some.
so i called and placed the order.
they couldnt organise a piss up in a guinness factory...
$$ good service not so good food.
beer is expensive.
sooooo disappointing & it had so much promise!!!
nope no beets.
i"m not a beet fan.
and my cucumbers were mushy and oldf-booo
my pharmacy reported that they called 3 times with no response.
i am looking for a new doctor.
the office staff seems unprofessional and uncaring.
i should have changed doctors last year.
urgent care billing as er visits.
a month later received a $1800 bill, this is almost medical billing fraud.
very very overpriced.
i believe my margarita was 15.95.
and tasted like a 4.00 drink.
if you have money to burn.
this is the right place..
never see me there again.
try mellow mushroom for 3.75.
20 ounce draft beers.
dirty and overpriced.
i ordered soft-shell crab and shrimp sandwich.
the crab costs more than 20 bucks with a drink.
what a disappointment!
i took my teenaged sons to dick's because i thought it would be fun.
this place is a joke.
i've never been to a worse hotel in my life.
most hotels learned long ago not to rush a customer checking out.
this one went out of its way to do so.
they couldn't have made my stay any worse.
extremely slow service especially when there was only 4 other tables.
also took 30 minutes to get our two meals.
which was a breakfast quesadilla and a scramble.
didn't refill our drinks.
there were also kids running around behind the counter.
try somewhere else for breakfast if you're looking in the area.
i do not recommend shopping online at kirkland's.
the items take forever to be received.
customer service rarely responds back to emails.
it has been eight days and they still have not refunded my paypal account.
they do not take ownership of the fact they never processed the refund.
perhaps they hope the customer does not notice the refund is not given....
this place sucks
muy first time and the last one...
and it was expensive!!!!!..
$42 for 2 mini pizzas and 1 soda!!!!...
once i been here before and there was a huge line.
maybe 100 people and senior citizens .
so i left went back today and the fire alarm was going off....
they wouldn't sell any tickets ...
what's up with this place?
no wifi, average coffee at best.
i dont get all the complements on this place.
was not thrilled with it at all.
honestly i don't understand why this place has such good reviews.
the food is good, but not great.
service was bad.
waitress came over like once in between meal.
we were there for about 45 minutes.
table next to us left and had forgotten their leftover dessert.
will probably not come back to this place.
this medical group is a mess!
telephone system is horrible to reach actual human.
frequently get stuck in phone tree, voice mailboxes full or calls not returned.
he said that they were closed and wouldn't assist me.
this is terrible customer service and represents the product that cox offers.
i guess they don't need business so find someone else.
worst experience ever!!!
paid $105.48 for a family 4 pack online.
the event coordinator confirmed we would be refunded the full amount.
i was never refunded.
these people will rob you!
worse uhaul experience ever!
i would never go to this uhaul ever again.
guy at the counter was extremely rude and unhelpful.
they clearly don't inspect their trucks.
horrible horrible experience!!
so remember when you bid on a car that you can't test drive!!
it might start and maybe even sound good but you never know.
also check the positive reviews and the people who post them funny.
its now 11 am and still not open.
i don't understand what business doesn't have hours posted.
being insulted by staff really ruined this place for me this time.
or better yet made the brunt of their homophobic jokes.
but that is just me.
too bad the first time i liked the food.
this time it did not taste as good.
i only have one phone.
the charger isn't charging my phone which means another trip to town square.
this is my fourth trip trying to get a car charger.
poor customer service.
didn't make it past the front door.
interesting, i guess they must double up for each client....
especially jose he was horrible.
after being a patient for over 4 years,  i will never go here again.
the staff is awful, does not communicate, and has no customer service.
they do not care about patients and just money.
no continuity of care here.
i had a bad experience.
they were un professional.
took a long time to draw up my tattoo.
i actually  had to go and get it covered up.
i dont recommend  anyone to go here you are better off tattooing yourself honestly!
this is not a greek restaurant.
it is a fish restaurant.
food is just okay.
very, very expensive and no view.
we were a little early so waited until 11 anyway.
i said don't you open at 11?
maybe probably an hour or so.
so can't review the food but service was a joke as you can read.
we won't give it another shot.
visited on monday 5/16/2016.
unfortunately i've seen this smith's go way downhill over the past decade.
it used to be clean and have a great variety of organic/natural/vegetarian food.
update: always long lines (especially at customer service) and stuff out of stock.
updating my review to one star to reflect that.
this place is horrible.
the bag check is worse than tsa.
i've never had anyone check my little bag as bad as them .
they took my tic tacs and perfume.
the vip line took so long just to get in.
we will never come back
this is a particularly bad boston market.
and they were understaffed and the staff they had was borderline incompetent...
definitely slow as hell.
this is a bar trying to be more.
the small plates were heavy and riffs on burgers and fries.
vets need more experience, the staff is very friendly and welcoming.
the girls left me sitting for an eternity.
the only good thing we had were the fire roasted olives.
we expected more out of this place based on reviews and especially the price.
brucshetta was medeocre and the pasta was not good at all.
ok, thanks for erasing my comments.
this vet is all about the money since they moved into a huge facility.
everything is about the treatment plan and we will never return.
this is vet place not a bank.
i would not recommend this business at all.
thanks for listening.
the flowers were absolutely horrendous!
they were already wilted by the time my wife got them.
there were only 3 roses and 3 lillies in the bouquet.
i ordered the large for $79.
i asked that the lilies be already bloomed.
1 had already bloomed(and was wilted), but the other 2 were buds.
the worst experience ever.
waited 2 hours for food..
not even entrees...
and we had a private room..
i guess we weren't important..
the school is small, promises an excellent education.
teachers are lacking, not a happy friendly atmosphere, kids are treated harshly.
bullying is rampant and nothing is done to remedy.
not enough servers....waiting for 40 minutes....server was told,  i know he's busy.
cone on i told u 3 times i need service and still none.
walked into the bar area to gamble and have a beer.
there wasn't a bartender around, not a good start.
i had one beer and she asked if i wanted the food menu.
ate here because it was convenient since we stayed at the signature.
we should have taken a cab somewhere else.
the cost is ridiculous for the food that you get.
looks nice on the outside and on the pics but i was really disappointed.
i met by best friend in vegas for a girl's weekend.
written on the side.
all the bells but no whistles...very disappointed.
only to be lied to and jerked around.
salesmen will say anything.
finance tries to bend you over.
the only other volvo dealership in town is much worse.
this experience has turned me off of volvo forever.
do not bring any of your electronics to this place.
for about three days.
additionally, he makes it very difficult to reach him by telephone.
really bad service.
will not go here again.
the food is phenomenal for a great price.
however, the service provided by the employees was poor, inadequate, sub-par, unsatisfactory, bad....
you get the idea.
very very very disorganized for pick up orders.
the kitchen can't keep up with orders but they keep taking orders.
the food isn't worth the wait.
horrible customer service.
i decided not to use them.
i never take the time to put any reviews usually.
too late for me.
a great way to lose customers is to frustrate them.
i was super excited to eat here at first but the service was terrible.
i work in food service at a bistro and give better service than that.
he also took forever to ask how our food was.
i was so blown away over the double price change.
and in addition no coupon was allowed.
i will never go there again.
i would have paid extra $$$.
i will be calling another mobile groomer!
so i got here and i ordered 6 shots.
first 3 were liquor and the next 3 where ordered chilled....
chilled means with ice.
do not order chilled shots.
it means watered down....
but if you are looking for authentic indian food stay away from origin india.
overall just a bad restaurant and service.
last night we had a reservation at 6:15.
we did, however, get water from a bus girl.
we left - feeling disappointed.
went next door for mexican instead.
so this pizza place is now called "boca park pizza".
and it's not just the name that changed the pizza sucks now ...
it's just bad very doughy and oiley...
do not use hale pet door.
the end result is functional doggie door on a messy wall.
i hired hale to avoid such a mess.
they should know better.
do not use hale.
their teenage cashiers require more training when dealing with customers.
rude and disrespectful to regular customers.
i used spend in the range of 2-3 hundred dlls a month here.
this was honestly one of the worst salon experiences i've ever had.
i hope they have submitted their establishment to tabatha to come and take over.
this place is a glorified supercuts.
i googled "best salon in vegas" and this one kept coming up.
they must have some really good marketing people.
this was far from the best salon in vegas.
$45 for a men's haircut could be used elsewhere.
overpriced and underwhelming.
i think i'll have some gelato.
it's pretty flimsy.
ooooh i get it.
lol the people are fine and the list of services offered are pretty standard.
shouldn't it be on the house if i got it done there?
or less than 15 bucks?
get out of here.
my friend and i made appointments for 4:30.
we showed up at 4:18 and we were not attended until 5:20!
there were three employees and two were working on one person.
they were tilting to the left!
it was the worst burrito i have ever had in my life.
she also couldn't finish hers.
bland, bland, bland.
what a waste of money
another 15 minutes went by and no food so i cancelled my order.
guys shows up but i refused the order.
if i could grade a zero i would.
has another heart surgery in 2-3 weeks.
my opinion and personal experience absolutely not.
no integrity, disingenuous, not honorable, false statements, false promises, extremely aggressive salesman.
sales manager walter real piece of work.
i could only recommend in good conscience to stay far away.
really the worst pizza i ever had.
a flat limp mushy pizza.
just look at the photo of my leftover $125 dinner entree.
very salty and fatty soup to start.
far too much sweet dressing on the otherwise very nice salad.
$20 mandatory tip on my $95 jubilation menu.
never coming here again.
totally unprofessional environment.
the ladies that work the front have absolutely no customer service skills.
i don't recommend taking your pets here for any type of service.
went to one of bobbie sales fri in sun city.
no signs out til after nine am.
she opened the door to about thirteen people in a very large house.
nothing was marked except furniture and higher end items.
terrible personality with a scowl on her face.
i heard the sound of glass breaking and left after that.
do not ever use her.
try natasha at silver linings estate sale.
professional honest and fair prices.
poor service, gummy shrimp,uncooked vegetables, no bread and this was on a slow night.
the only good thing is that it was quiet without the noisy children.
if you have doberman pinschers and pitbull dogs the more the merrier!!!
i'm truly disgusted with this place.
it's so bad i've had to call the police.
i live in a pigs breakfast?
i'm not understanding why there's not a friendly person that works at these locations.
at least the 2 i've been to.
we go to credit unions because it's more personal.
i'm really starting to regret it now though.
i have shopped there since it opened.
these people have been very nice - but last night severely ticked me off.
what've you done or not done bellagio?
you were the gold standard.
we should have asked for a refund.
tough chewy meat, skinny crab, poor service.
one star because of the desserts.
worst experience with this naked city.
gives the brand a serious bad name!
the gentleman was extremely rude and inconsiderate about the issues.
his excuse was that they were too busy.
this has ruined my overall experience with my first uner eats experience.
thankfully jaime was an awesome server and made me forget!!!
the worst place to be for food.
recommendation don't come.
you will be ripped off and the food has no taste.
the place is sticky and hard to live by.
the restroom is even worse though.
it is filthy,smelly, and disgusting.
don't come or u will find out what i mean.
this place looks nice on the outside and inside.
god forbid you ask a question and get a helpful answer.
emailed the gm and no reply from him.
i guess the lead by example.
save your money, and don't go here.
this place is so stuck up!
i hate to write negative reviews, but i had no choice for this restaurant....
let me start by saying that the staff was extremely friendly and nice.
but that's where it ends.
the food is very, very, very poor in quality.
i didn't expect gourmet food for $13, but the quality was very bad.
the shrimp looked and tasted old.
the rice, chicken dishes, beef dishes, etc were really bad.
paid $34 for handwash + $10 tip.
this is the worst car wash i have ever been to.
been trying to call but nobody is picking up the phone.
this is the last time i will be visiting this god awful place.
very unfortunate professional for a management position if that.
at least have some respect and customer service mentallity.
very unfortunate organized and confused at their own job!
do not waste your time here
don't expect much in terms of good customer service and you won't be disappointed.
i would give these guys a negative star if i could.
they came out to fix the fan blower on my ac unit.
doctor cool was not willing to respond as quickly the did the first time!
there license number is 52792.
this place is terrible and they rip people off!
very rude on the phone as well!!
save your money and choose somewhere else to eat!!
very poor service.
had to search down our server to order and again to get our bill.
the guy who brought our water was very nice though.
the food was bland and mediocre at best.
i would definitely not recommend this place.
i want to echo other reviews...i should have checked first!!
pay more for another trail ride experience!
one word- "overrated".
service was horrible, food mediocre at best, save your money and go elsewhere!
snotty scottsdale at it's worst!
very disappointed when i ordered from the healthy menu at what was served.
not at all healthy.
but clearly it is not.
by far the worst manicure pedicure i have ever received.
they rough, rude and provide low grade services.
better luck doing your own nails.
doubt i will return to top golf.
i haven't had a horrible food experience in a while....megas broke that cycle.
the food is mediocore at best.
the restaurant ambience isn't great.
it's a little ghetto.
we went there on 03/04/2016 around 4:30.
the ribs were very dry and the sides were very small.
you will not get great value here.
we did find parking on a side street, but not real convenient.
the friendly service is probably not enough to get us back for another visit.
walked in and saw a coach roach running on the floor.
think they forgot the leaves on my chinese broccoli dish.
worst dental experience ever....
the dentist dr sekon seemed ok advice to the dr.
i don't like leaving bad reviews, but these guys weren't very helpful.
it's a shame.
please sucks now.
we used to go here and i remember it being much better.
not any better than refrigerated grocery store sushi, and overpriced at that.
here is a tip for your sushi chefs.
watch jiro dreams of sushi.
no sauce or flavor or anything.
few pieces of veggies but not enough.
the dumpling dough is so thick its not completely cooked through so its inedible.
it just tastes like wet flour.
waste of money.
terrible experience ordering online.
i asked to speak to a manager.
i told him i'm mad that i pre-tipped when i prepaid online.
will be a long time before i give them my business again!
no lunch special.
ordered ox tail i got 3 small pieces for $13 bucks.
not caribbean to me not much flavor very blan taste.
caribbean food has lots of flavor puerto rican, cuban, dominican & jamaica.
worst popeye's anywhere.
they do not serve spicy chicken at all.
this location should be called  poopyeyes, since they do not serve spicy chicken.
i order the fingers with extra hot wing sauce on the side.
much better than poopeyes.
the food was, to put it simply, quite underwhelming.
drinks were expensive and they had a shockingly bad selection of beer.
go somewhere else to watch a sporting event.
i would not recommend this place.
and to top it off they didn't tell us it was 1.50 per topping.
wouldn't come back !
apple..."genius?" more like apple (fill in the blank)
ticket prices are higher and the theatres are not very clean.
and very clean.
the place was very small to get in and out of.
parking is limited.
however i have to disagree with the lack of customer service.
the person who helped me started to tell me my options and prices.
sadly it was out of my price range.
will find alternatives.
awful  organization .ongoing billing discrepancies.
if anyone needs help to battle these scammers.
i will assist you in your money back efforts if needed.
pretty shady this location charges you for water!
we are in arizona people.
i have to say that this was the worst waxing appointment ever.
she completely ruined my perfect brows that alyssa had already created.
i would not recommend going to bri.
she does not know what she's doing at all.
let's start with an hour limit.
i hope that guy gets his soul back.
sushi tasted decent.
steak and chicken dishes tasted stale.
5 people from my group got sick after.
must have been rotten food.
do not try the buffet.
this lab is horrible.
receiving that was absolutely absurd as no other salon has ever claimed that.
some of the most ridiculous, ostentatious and pretentious individuals out there.
nasty, tasteless nuggets of over-fried batter.
even long john silvers is better than this dump.
it was not good at all.
the rice was hard..the food had no flavor.
the fruit was not fresh it had been sitting out too long.
they don't have a lunch special on sundays and they are over priced.
however the sushi was ok.
we won't be back.
totally a waste of money.
there is no customer service whatsoever.
a lot of food selection but the flavor are just way too strong.
and why do you put that jar of water on the table?
saw fly flying around so this place didn't seem to be clean to me.
one star for the chicken curry the only thing i really like.
won't go back.
came to to bass pro shop to see santa....
kids were very excited to see santa..
advertisement says santa will be there till 5 ..
we got there like around 3:30 and line to santa was already closed..
it's bullshit how they advertise something that ain't even true..
we drove pretty far just for bs..
i decided on kretzlers for my family birthday celebration.
apparently the times have changed.
we waited patiently for an hour for our house salads, which were still subpar.
my friends and i were really disappointed with our experience at ninety's.
what we got was not worth the money.
nothing to be excited about.
the macarons were nothing special either.
please just save your money and go elsewhere.
i ordered a birthday cake with vanilla butter cream icing and white cake.
i will not be going back here.
worst bar ever.
i can't even describe how bad the service was.
joe, this bar needs a lot of work
customers beware....their rewards system was devalued....another airmiles scam.
this company's reward system was devalued .....
they have devalued their customer's loyalty.
bland overpriced food!!!
unless you like the taste of cardboard with a little seasoning
sat for 15 min and no one came over so i left.
slowest moving staff ive ever seen.
atleast 4 different servers walked or more like strolled by  like 10x each
salesmen are a little pushy.
if you make a purchase don't plan on returning anything .
they make it a huge hassle.
they have some decent stuff but they charge a lot for it.
makes you feel like you're in the post office.
can they move any slower???
once again, the cashiers move like thickened molasses.
so what am i saying here?
i'm saying that the service here is very, very terrible and sluggish.
seriously is there only one person working here!?
get out of here with that!
there's no one in the store.
they broke my engine cover while changing my motor oil.
they didn't even have the decency to let me know they broke it.
shame on them.
terrible customer service.
won't be going back.
if you happen to go there make sure to check everything before you leave.
rebecca was rude from the beginning when checking into the hotel.
my friend asked what beers he had since a list or menu wasn't given.
this was the most terrible experience i have ever received at hotel.
this place scammed me and my girlfriend and refused to make it right!
you are taking a gamble with your money going to the state fair!
you were warned.
has anyone been to this chili's lately.
no. good, you are not missing anything.
went there with my son and had a hamburger.
spoke with the manager and he gave me a 5 dollar gift certificate.
my wife signed up and also signed up our children for the day care.
then my wife walked in and the teacher looked surprised.
she decided to check them all out because she was upset.
they don't even communicate with you.
customer service is so important, and this place lacks it completely.
so disappointed, you just lost a loyal customer.
food quality is sub par.
we weren't even on a day that was busy.
not worth it...
bad service and mediocre food marked our dinning experience.
by far the worst buffet i have ever been to.
how can a 4star hotel like westgate allowed this to happen is beyond comprehension.
the name is fresh buffet but nothing in there is fresh.
prime rib was chalk-dry.
shrimp cocktail smelled like it has gone bad and slimmy.
that was the last draw for me.
this place is a total joke.
if i could give it 0 stars i would have.
they have no respect for others time!
i will drive across town to avoid this place next time!!
yesterday i ate there with six other people and ordered the fried cod sandwich.
this is disgraceful.
take it off the menu if you can't serve a larger portion than that.
otherwise you are just insulting your customers.
do not order this sandwich.
do not order delivery from here.
they are horrible.
wish i could get my money back, left worse than i went in.
tried 2nd time and left without any relief.
purchased a month of visits.
this was the worst chipotle i've ever been to.
the line where the food is was filthy.
the rice was so old that it was burnt into chunks.
rice shouldn't stay together like that.
the food was awful.
never going to this location again.
go to solon.
2 hours of watching kids fight, cry, scream & steal toys from each other.
wow, terrible service from staff across all boards.
liked watching games there previously , but maybe not so much.
might have to pick a new place.
always had a good experience.
not my problem.
no one to fix the problem either.
been coming here for almost 2 years and same tech yet can't be accommodating.
will be going elsewhere!
i'm so disappointed.
i haven't been in since december and it's just silly now.
we paid $50 for a 2 entres (including tip).
my guest and i both had water.
for a mediocre  (at best) meal, it's just not worth it.
the work that was done by this business has been fine so far.
so i did it.
got here at 9:05 (says it opens at 9)...
stood around for a while, nobody is here.
hours aren't posted on the door to confirm if yelp is right or wrong.
walls paper thin - could hear everything from next door.
room feels more like a hostel or homeless shelter than a "3 star" hotel.
it works perfectly.
although i would still never buy anything else here.
way too much hassle.
this place is clean and new, empty, but the burgers are revolting.
these people no absolutely nothing about burgers.
don't eat here!
they would be packed if they just stuck with falafels or something else.
u might as well go to mcdonald's.
very little meat and mostly a sticky, gelatinous goo which was quite unfortunate.
being a visitor to montreal, maybe this is the local style?
if so, please know that this is not what bao should be.
i wish i could personally suspend her medical license.
dr., heal thy self!
avoid this location!!
i would give this place 0 stars if i could.
don't waste your time at this place.
at the end, he destroyed my hair.
he might be good at cuts and styling.
but i'm not going back there again.
i am seriously disappointed and haven't even gotten a chance to try it yet!
update: i tried for over a month.
i gave up and went with cox and got service the same day.
walked in and they weren't very busy.
seated promptly to a filthy table.
took over five minutes before our server came to take a drink order.
after that we never saw her again.
how do you forget a drink order consisting of a coke and a tea??
probably won't ever be back, terrible terrible terrible service.
we have been regular clients of albo.
the pizza we got through delivery was nothing like the ones we pick up.
the woman on the phone was rude.
we won't order again.
too bad, it was our weekly go-to.
pretty cheesy in my opinion.
all these add on fees are ridiculous.
advertise the actual fees instead of hiding them in contracts.
dishonest if you ask me.
nothing but problems with this place for the last 8 months!
had tires replaced, since then have had a tire leak constantly.
i have had to be without my vehicle for months!
complete con artist.
going to the bbb
unless you enjoy being treated like a number, i do not recommend mesa pediatrics!
this was probably one of the worst customer service/dining experiences i have ever had.
first courses dropped off with no explanation and the first 2-were meat!
basically i waited another 15 min before they brought out something i could eat?
definitely would not recommend even though the food was actually very good!
extremely rude staff.
will never be returning here.
don't waste your money or time!
stay clear of this place.
during my pedi  the girl cut my big toe...ok things happen.
i was now set for my sns nails, yup you guessed it...cut my finger...really?
so i would not be back and would not recommend this nail salon!
two other guests in front of me received full on attention.
i was not even acknowledged with a greeting.
i did not have an appt, but the door stated they take walk ins.
this is my 4th or 5th time.
it is very disappointing.
pumpkin ravioli filling was tasty but the pasta was undercooked.
even after i sent it back.
not worth it
i wanted a one time treatment.
truly nolan wouldn't give a price over the phone.
no thank you.
rippppppopp off if u eat in!!!
oh and the lox they say us nova is actually salty belly lox.
it's way cheaper.
they think we all a buncha schmucks ova here!!!!
i am not ultra critical when it comes to restaurants.
however, in this case this restaurant has sub standard everything.
the server was terrible, rude, abrupt and got our order wrong more than once.
the time we waited to get served and receive our food was ridiculous.
the drinks watered down with more ice in the glass than liquid.
i could go on.
my advice, stay away.
it is not worth your time or stomach.
just had dinner there there service was horrible....
my garlic bread was burnt asked for a new one and was burnt.
waited 15 mins for my server to close my bill out.
the guests next to me were having issues with their dinner.
my family and i are never going to go back their again.
horrible horrible service don't shop there.
omg, bad food, bad service.
you have been warned.
i saw the bad reviews.
my bad for still going, mike glendora ca
no greeting !!!
if i could give them no stars i would.
this food was disgusting and bland.
do not order from here!!!!
the worst sub i ever had!
the tuna was bad and the cold cuts are inferior!
i was sick for 2 days!!!
the board of health should check this place out!!!
whatever you do, do not get suckered into the presentation crap they do here!!!!!!
as for the rooms they're just ok.
other than that it's ok nothing special.
trust me on the presentation for free gifts thing.
super l has some ridiculous pricing.
am i at a bodega?
am i at circle k?
god no even they would tax you on chips this crazy.
unfortunately, my experience with this restaurant was very disappointing.
although a little confused, we all obliged and waited outside of the restaurant.
30 minutes later, still no table.
it was a shame because we were really looking forward to dining there.
worst service i have ever experienced in charlotte.
but the other lady was so nice and courteous.
will never come back.
google reviews about this place says it all.
food taste is not good either.
placed an order this evening on the website for a 5:10 pm pickup.
i walk out of the restaurant and go home.
first time customer.
i was excited to see full service and try out a new bar.
it was literally slop.
i ordered the nachos and the girl kept pouring cold queso sauce over it.
my husband ordered the burrito and it tasted as if the chicken was burnt.
i think cafe rio and rubios is way better and even taco bell.
it was also very expensive.
$45 for four items.
their chips were also sub-standard.
the new management is awful!
but nothing changes.
and everything is really dirty
food was ok.
i just don't get why everything in mgm area is way overpriced!!
its not worth it.
go somewhere outside of mgm properties.
total ripoff scam.
worst customer service with genius bar techs at this store.
the appointments are never on time.
i won't go back again.
flat rate $9 shipping regardless of size of order.
they don't allow kids which is odd.
i don't really understand why my kids can't eat here?
we won't be back.
other hard rocks allow kids.
i am sitting at mgm buffet right now having brunch at lunch hour.
waste of money and time.
worst korean bbq i have ever eaten!
ever since the new owners replaced chingu, the place has been a mess.
only half of the grilling meats on the menu were delivered to our table.
and the ones that did, you could clearly tell they were still frozen/half frozen.
we came here on a saturday evening, you would think they would be prepared!!
extremely disappointed and would never come back.
always a bad experience, but never shopping here again.
i finally ga e in and bought it and it smelled like rotten eggs.
this is definitely the most unprofessional gnc i've been to.
the owner is awesome and don't worry she will tell you she is.
this starbucks always has a line.
they are slow and they are always messing up your order.
they cheat you on the way they fill your cup.
i am going to quit buying coffee at this location.
their system is down.
we even tried back again & nope, closed at lunch time.
:( so much for trying this place!
so my family and i just ordered gyros.
worst meal we have ever had!!!!!!
worst food, the salad was even bad.
while i have my registered emotional support animal!!
i am blown away that i am stuck with this terrible company.
it started with the sign-up process.
the price the guy gives me on the phone turns out to be bogus.
then after i finally give up on getting that honored we move to installation.
you would think after the install everything should be fine but no.
problem after problem.
what a monopoly.
they broke a mirror on his truck last week.
the owner won't even speak with him.
this is bad business and i want to make sure everyone knows!!!!!!
always loved this place, but last time we tried it had a terrible experience.
wanted to order fish and was told they no longer served it.
we are like " what the heck" ????
the food that we got was not that great this time anyway.
customer service sucks!!
i stood at the counter for about 10min.
before anyone asked if i needed any help.
first time ever going to a fat burger and the last time.
of course i am.
the place was about empty thus why i didn't not understand the delay.
don't waste your time and money here.
typical shady insurance practices.
literally waited 20 minutes for a chicken bowl and biscuits.
the employees didn't apologize for the wait at all.
indigestion on a bun.
service was lacking organization.
lot of work with little out put.
but recently their food quality has gone downhill as their bussiness has increased.
went there around 8pm on a weekday.
just overall disappointment.
we stopped in after my daughter's dance recital for a celebratory ice cream.
the only two flavors available- cucumber sorbet and chocolate.
no thanks, we'll take our celebration elsewhere.
so so so bad.
i am scared that we're going to get food poisoning.
i basically paid $45 to get food poisoning.
don't eat here
i chose dr. kovac specifically as a certified practitioner of art.
avoid this dealership unless you want to get ripped off !!!
drove 1.5 hrs because avertised price of used bmw was reasonable.
terrible nail salon.
trust me and don't go there.
rushing through the whole thing.
went to dinner friday 3/9 nite....this one suck!
not worth going back ....57$ i would rather have went to mcdonald's !!!!!
i gave 1 star for my skinny long ice tea!!!!!
i will never go to pep boys again.
i received text messages all week reminding me of the appointment.
would have been nice to know
what a joke this company is.
very unprofessional, and do not know the first thing about business etiquette.
rude, disrespectful owner runs the business.
read the other reviews and most people will agree.
spend your money elsewhere.
i come here because they have my medical records.
i'll wear it.
but this place is as bad as it gets.
i've talked to a number of doctors and this isn't standard practice.
i wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy.
uber is a rip off!!, they invent the prices and impose it on you...
i received a 5$ bill for that!!!, never again
lol) got a call today saying my insurance flat out denied my botox coverage.
thanks for stringing me along another week guys!
guess it's really time for a new office now.
worse del taco i've ever been to.
my food was burnt so i returned it and they charged for 10$ min.
and my drink.
so i said charge me for the burnt food it would be less.
they would not do it.
no air conditioning no fans.
no customer appreciation
are here twice and both times the wings were undercooked.
never coming here again.
pickup process unbelievably slow.
fifteen minutes to get a bed frame during a slow period.
i've gone at 11 am on a tues and still had hours to wait.
range officers are too overbearing.
range is cramped and there is no room to move.
i won't be back.
when i went on black friday i noticed great sales.
returned my items the next week and went to target .
i've never had anything bad to say about it until yesterday.
keep your money and bring the business to the other ice cream store !
very bad experience when calling to order two pizzas.
website advertising pricing on pizzas is not the same as when called.
to me this is false advertising, won't be ordering from this location again.
absolutely horrible experience.
my car had trouble starting.
i said what am i supposed to do drive around for two hours?
(i was afraid the car wouldn't restart) and he shrugged his shoulders.
so, i drove around and waited two hours.
this church's chicken restaurant has been closed for over a year!
the burger was burned and bitter.
the sweet potato fries were also under cooked.
for the price of the food, you would expect a higher quality of food.
food is cold and either bland or bad tasting.
had the classic benedict and the french toast and egg.
service is polite and nice, but super slow...
tiny place and still didn't see the staff during my entire breakfast time.
was told like 3 times i'll get a refill of my coffee right away...
that never happened.
went into office for cleaning.
i have good insurance and they still wanted to charge $600.
i've been an accountant for 28 years they need to hire a knowledgeable.
person who can be polite and know simple math.
my five year old could do the job better!
definitely won't be back!!
frozen everything except the white wine which was luke warm.
we will not be coming  back any time soon.
bummed because it had so much ambience potential!
the absolute worst service i've ever had in my life.
she had zero personality.
i genuinely tried hard to get her to engage.
i feel bad for the restaurant if they have staff like this.
i paid it and left.
goodbye mesa hooters, i'll stick to mill, they have better food/service.
if i could give it less than 1 star i would.
they are consistently out of bagels and very slow.
i hope they can do some training to help the team.
i work in a very busy restaurant that serves 400 people a day.
my wife and i live in anthem.
we went here cause it is close to us.
ordered some take out from here last night.
$52 worth of the worst fish my wife and i have ever had.
we took a couple bites and threw the rest in the garbage.
i suspect this place will be out of business soon.
i give one star cause can't give less
here is the  in just got at mcdonalds.
apparently, no one gets a fresh .
mine was burnt!!!!
one star in terms of service.
i would even assign no star if that's possible.
if not for their food, i would never come back to this place.
their service is horrible!
you're best bet is to order take-out.
worst service ever!
a little pricey, and the quality and service was not there to match.
the pizza was ok and the salad was great!
there wine bar looked interesting but i am not sure i will be back.
came by with my wife for a drink and to do some work.
i have never seen a waitress deliberately ignore a table before.
these people are scammers!
the first time i used them i was impressed.
i used them a 2nd time and was thoroughly disappointed.
first, they couldn't get the lock off the back of the truck.
then my roommate ended up helping them because they were so slow and inadequate.
they tried to get extra $$ too and a tip.
i told them their tip will go to my roommate who helped them.
plus they damaged some of my furniture.
i will never again use this company!
closedas of april 29th
worst cleaning service i've ever experienced.
do not bring your vehicle to this location for any reason.
my food was covered in cheese!
no flavor just salty and plain!
i was looking forward to checking out this new restaurant.
ordered 4 burgers and 2 poutines.
when the food arrived, the poutines were missing.
left feeling very frustrated.
and the burgers were not good at all.
no this is not in regards to hippa.
it its in regards to unprofessional rude staffing.
hippa had nothing to do with it.
all hippa forms were filled out and on file you can check with brandon.
i asked for a glass of water and am still waiting for it.
after 3 consecutive bad service experiences we have taken our breakfast business elsewhere
nasty flavor and burnt!!!
so we opened the second box and it was the same thing.
this place is horrible!!
i will definitely stick with jet's pizza for now on.
i don't even like that i'm giving them one star .
they deserve 0.
they were rude and not helpful .
we will not be back .
she checked and stated they have a total of 4.
i rushed to this party city from across town and made it before closing.
they were just fucking lazy as fuck to look for it.
never will come back to this location ever!!
manager was fucking useless and don't know how to do shit.
what a scrub
this is the worst portuguese i have ever had.
chicken is tasteless.
piri piri and spices are nowhere to be found.
potatoes watery, rice just bad.
came for the view.
poor customer service and left extremely unsatisfied.
if i could give zero stars i would.
this dealer is very shady.
they sold me a dangerous vehicle and won't own up to it.
do not buy from this place!!!!
i can't warn you enough.
nothing about this bar excites me.
karoke, trivia night, bingo or something.
shit, adding a touch tunes machine would help enormously.
what happened to the female bartender's skimpy outfits?
come on man.
this place is disappointing for a brand new franchise.
i ordered the thin crust pizza and it came out like a giant cracker.
possibly one of the worst pizzas i've ever had.
zero reason to return or order from here again.
waste of breakfast and time.
won't be coming back here!
never come here go to silvercity!
i give it three stars for my bloody mary.
the pork sandwich was way too smoky.
the burger was like crunchy and way overcooked.
the staff was friendly but not efficient.
do not order the lettuce wraps they're disgusting.
plus fruit flies flying around what's with that?
stay away from them if you love and care for your pets!!
also my dog's behavoir is worse now than when i dropped her off..
no response  from andrew in months..
if i could give less than one star i would.
i have been in vegas for 10 years.
worst customer service and club i've ever seen
i don't know how there are 4/5 stars here!
i had to repeat our sandwiches 3 times and my medium soup twice.
the vegetable selection is slim and they have one seasoning: italian.
now on to the sandwich(es)..
i ate 3 bites.
the one star is for the bread.
try madeline's next door, or which which around the corner.
if i could give it 0 stars i would.
absolutely disgusting food.
such a shame.
it was the best place in town.
i'll never go back.
soggy, gross sandwich.
half the menu is misspelled.
overpriced for what you get.
and i love chipotle, which is next door...
so why would i ever go to tony d's?
honestly i called 4 times this week haven't gotten a call back.
they seen me once and no follow up.
i've requested several appts on the stupid portal and still nothing.
now i am 5 days without a refill.
do you guys realize how dangerous it is to stop taking medicine cold turkey.
i'm honestly so disappointed i thought you guys were doctors to help and care.
so crazy because i seen all the bad reviews i should've known.
hopefully i can find a new place.
he was texting and scrolling on instagram the whole time.
i don't believe that it interefered with my test results (i hope!).
however, i found it incredibly rude and unprofessional.
the director is rude and unprofessional to parents with concerns.
got hit by someone with progressive insurance.
it's been a week and no one has called me.
my car isn't drive able.
then the claims adjuster is on vacation.
i definitely won't be ordering here again.
live close by so have tried several times.
order is usually wrong so make sure you check it before you leave.
quality is 50/50 and owner lives in phoenix.
complaining is pointless.
if you have a choice just go somewhere else.
worst service i have received in a long time.
we were a party of four.
then our server switched, but failed to tell the new server our order.
don't waste your time.
grimaldi's up the street has better food and service.
customer service on manager's part was horrible!!
i am done with giving this mcds anymore chances for my business.
they just cannot seem to get it together.
never go to a place without yelping!
ugh, our out of town friends were visiting and staying at ti.
they saw the unlimited alcohol sign and went for it.
no idea how some folks could give this place 5 stars.
must be vegas buffet virgins that don't know any better.
the food had been sitting there probably since lunch.
limp corn that tasted like it came from a frozen batch.
what a waste of my money!
take your $31.95 and go have lunch buffet at wicked spoon!
the one star is for the fabulous server who looked after us well.
bought a voucher on livingsocial for this service.
called for an appointment twice, and left detailed and friendly messages.
waited 5 business days for a return call.....got no response!
got a refund from livingsocial.
ordered the corned beef hash with 3 basted eggs.
it had so much oil, it was like a soup..
couldn't even eat it without wanting to puke.
literally used a spoon to take out the oil.
i ate only a small portion and disliked it.
wish they took it off my bill but oh well
staff are asleep at the wheel.
receptionists socialize at the expense of patients waiting to be seen.
be prepared to wait.
found this out the hard way.
let me start off by stating that i love dollar tree.
however this particular one disgusted me beyond.
the floors were filled with days maybe even weeks worth of debris.
it's very concerning because all it takes is a broom and you sell them.
they are rip off scam artists!!
the internet contract was for $23 dollars a day plus tax, total $41.
it is 4 days later and 4 phone calls to them and no response.
obviously they are giving competitive quotes and then adding ridiculous surcharges.
do not do business with this crooked company, as everyone else has advised.
this place is now closed down.
it is turning into another lindo michoacan.
lost my business forever.
she said no you can only have beef!
anyway slow service.
you lost my business mr.
my husbands hair was just butchered by the rudest old woman.
she had black hair and was smoking a cig outside when we got there.
didn't wash her hands, nothing.
he explained what he wanted.
well, he tried.
ended up giving him a way too short, choppy, horrible cut.
she was horrendous.
the worst cirque du soleil show ever.
no live music.
product received in the mail was absolutely destroyed.
not in a sellable or useable condition in any way whatsoever.
thanks for nothing staci k.
if i can give it a zero, i would.
the dj, worst customer service ever.....
i'm in the industry and 0
really horrible service.
i was there yesterday and the man waiting on us (we are they frequently).
it started to get weird...
needless to say not going back.
at least subway doesn't condone violence among women.
holy crap this mall got ghetto.
i just went here to ask about whether they make custom pieces.
there were no customers in the shop.
ice cream is fine, but 2 major problems with this place.
1) why is only 1 person working?
6 people in line and very hard for the girl to keep up.
i would think this is a major safety violation.
2) the exhaust vent was 80% dirty with black debris.
the vent is right over the prep area.
never come here.
car wash and vacuum job is mediocre at best.
no customer service.
you all will be hearing from a lawyer.
we had reservations for 10 and were seated in the back room.
as we were perusing the menus another group was seated in the same room.
i would avoid this place like the plague.
as a customer you will feel wrong and insignificant and be told as much.
i would award this establishment negative stars if that was an option.
small, dirty, trash floating by...yuck!
waitress service so lacking that we had to keep going to bar for drinks.
if at the bar be prepared for $18-$20 drinks.
the upside...not that crowded.
wait...guess we know why....
the donuts in this place is overly sweeeet!!!
almost hard to swallow sweet!
i was very disappointed.
not what i have in mind when it comes to donuts.
the dough was not fluffy at all and very dense!
abhorrent customer service.
salad bar continually empty.
not enough employees.
poor experience overall and consistently.
i have called home office so now it's a fight to get my money.
go to hertz or avis.
stay away they are thiefs
& that was a huge fail and the overall experience was horrible.
and me being in a rush didn't have the time to argue about it.
worst experience ever, i wouldn't order cake from them.
they should be embarrassed offering cakes like this in a brand new walmart.
this also all happened today!
we must have gone on an off day seeing all the great reviews.
it came with just egg.
then they bring over done bacon, but i stopped complaining.
then they didn't offer anything like a dessert or comp for the sandwich!
a place like this should do something when the screw up.
this place has the rudest waitstaff i've ever met.
no one is friendly.
food was mediocre.
we won't be back and we don't recommend to anyone.
had more waiters standing around doing nothing than customers in the restaurant .
pizza was okay, but nothing to write home about.
scottsdale and phoenix are the last places that need another pizza joint.
terrible service and even worse food.
it looks and tastes like something made in a high school cafeteria.
the bald gentleman serving us was beyond rude.
i will never return.
it's incredible and the staff are so nice.
the doctors are great, but the staff is horrible!
not even exaggerating.
omg i'm so f*ckn pissed at this place!
i paid for $25 of meatless pizza and 2 bottles of water!
they should've given me more meat!!!
the crust was soggy, too much sauce and barely had any basil.
i wish i could've taken a pic but i forgot.
this resort is over-used and under-maintained.
bbqs didn't work.
noisy at 5am from staff rolling their carts down the sidewalk.
smoking is allowed almost everywhere, even stinky cigars.
why did i not read review first.
i got the pesto chicken that said it was just made.
it was stale and tasted pretty bad.
i think i'll throw it away.
a bit too pretentious and hipster centric for me.
coffee is too pricy despite being on high end 17th avenue.
the portions are tiny, and the prices are very high.
i ordered an orange juice, and received a shot glass of it.
after receiving the bill, the oj was $7 and my bagel was $5.
this is the definition of a tourist trap.
terrible direction of flow for customer service.
odd staff turnover, oppressed atmosphere.
extra insurance for phone buys you more headaches and rudeness.
always a scam feel and always about upgrades.
save your time.
keep tossing money until resolution happens.
when my contract is up i'll be free.
wish i could give 0 stars.
not sure about foods either.
holy smokes heed the warnings.
i will never order from here again.
not only is the pizza unimpressive but 2 hours after ordering, it was delivered...
not the first time experiencing this either.
four of us wanted seperate checks.
we were told we had to go around the drive thru 4 times.
mind you, there were no people here at nearly 2 in the morning.
please like this post if you have had this experience to.
management must not care...
staff was rude & unsanitary.
hostess was wearing a crop top....
memorial day, stopped in early afternoon.
when entering in the doors the smell was horrible.
we just wanted a soup and salad  lunch .
how can a salad taste bad?
well it sure was so we ordered more salad and again wilted .
if you look on the reviews it is completely like that for other customers.
completely disappointed  just moved over to this area.
i've been here twice and i won't be returning.
the chefs clearly don't know how to properly cut sushi.
we received a plate that tasted fishy.
the line is ridiculously long even if you're on the waitlist.
someone threw up in the swimming pool so they have to close it.
overall not a great experience
run away as soon as possible.
it's a very expensive place to go guys .
i don't recommend this to anybody else.
what a great seller let alone customer service guy.
i will never come back for sure
couldn't be further from the truth.
i am leaving this practice.
the epitome was when my pa said that he has problems too.
i was stunned and could only respond that well, i am not his doctor!
i tried and tried - longer than i should have to make this work.
i feel as though they are just a money mill.
a few croutons added colour.
that was it.
i ordered and pulled up to the window.
i'm pretty much done with this location entirety and this company all together.
they seem to hire crew and managers who other restaurants deem undesirable.
bad doctors, bad pt staff.
the doctors are a mob that want to make money.
dr. zoltan was curt and weird.
dr. armendariz was a jerk, period.
the pt staff does not do astem.
astem is a physical approach to fixing an ankle.
instead, all i did was strengthen to no avail.
ate here last night and i must say it is expensive.
three people costs 97.00 with tax.
we ordered 3 beers and that was an additional $14.
$4 for a bottle of water???
$10 for an over salty smoked meat sandwich.
we all have to use our time wisely.
just to go once upon a child.
never will go back!
stephanie smith is a thief with horrific customer service skills.
i filed a better business bureau complaint, to which she never responded.
and when you are dissatisfied, please write to the bbb.
she does not deserve a positive rating.
no no i would not recommend this place to anyone.
there are plenty of korean dessert cafes with better tasting menus.
i was really hungry and needed some food quickly .
they ran out of biriyani so took the three item thali .
i have never tasted something so bland in my life .
only pros the girl who gave was nice .
they give you frozen pita in place of a naan .
for me why even bother because i  won't eat it .
don't waste your money
example: the bbq combination plate which had the bbq pork, roast duck and chicken.
overall an underwhelming experience i'd say don't waste your time here.
the tacos  came out 5 minutes later and the food was not even cooked.
i asked the lady what she just served me and she laughed.
really poorly taught class with maia.
hopefully she can improve and learn to not gossip about others in the community!!
been here a couple times.
wasn't amazed with the service the first time.
can't remember what i thought of the food.
decided to give it another shot and ordered a pizza for pickup.
they said it would be ready in 30-35 min.
got there in plenty of time.
took it home and was completely cold.
had to warm it up in the microwave which basically turned it into cardboard.
won't be back for a third time.
i would not recommend this restaurant.
the contents inside were mushy and not appetizing.
this place needs some help.
i've been to this location 3 times.
this place is on my off limits list !!!
i thought maybe this was a hidden gem, not at all!
food was okay, space is very dank, service was horrible!
my dinner counterpart did not like her meal, the waitress' response: sorry.
a few days later, i'm noticing they ran my debit card twice.
the guacamole was brown and the salsa was bad.
customer service was terrible, reporting this place, the kitchen was filthy.
i do not recommend this location, it's a possibility you could get sick.
i walked into sorelle today and was left utterly disappointed.
the employee organization and management really needs some serious improvement!
i cannot express how disappointed i am.
my cajun sandwich had flavors that did not meld together whatsoever.
the fries were stale and seemed reheated in the microwave.
couldn't get out of there quickly enough.
been here years ago and then recently went back.
this place is awful!
the employees are either dumb or just don't give a shit.
they're unorganized and totally clueless.
i have never used a business so poorly run.
or maybe they're all this bad.
this by far is the worst ran business i've ever encountered.
they'll have two registers open for dozens of customers.
meaning be prepared to spend half a day just paying for your items.
they'll have two registers open while having dozens of employees walking around.
please take your money down the street to cosco.
this place obviously is not in business with customer service in mind.
i came with six people...
not one meal was good!
full of grease, didn't taste like anything!
best part was the stale chips!
would not recommend at all!
afterwards we decided to go next door to the gamestop.
this store is really horrible!
they kept following us around, recommending games they hadn't even tried for themselves...
just pulling random crap from the shelves.
do not waste your time and money!!!!
sandwich was all bread and the meat was very dry!!!
my buddy ordered a gyro....huge mistake!!!
pita was very cold and fell apart.
it taste nothing like a gyro!!
this place sucks!!
what a waste of $20
i am so disappointed in fridays what happened here?
the uncc one is straight hood this one makes food dry and poorly cooked.
it took 15 min just to get a water.
the theme here i guess is 15 min or more per item.
this rating is strictly for the waitress name sarah d.
i would give a 0 if i could !
i had to constantly follow up on my labs and request a call back.
i had labs done weeks ago and barely heard from their office yesterday.
only for them to refer me to urgent care.
i believe it was an employee that did it.
here is the review i posted on their facebook page for more details.
not for me it isn't there are too many other places i can go
turn around and go to another casino..
i might as well been at the chow hall on base.
the quality of food here is terrible.
i cook better.
the only thing that was decent was the shrimp and crab legs.
so if you can eat $24 of this, then this is a decent place.
prime rib was chewy and under cooked, turkey was dry.
the deserts were bland and the service...well what service???
i will never go back.
2/10 home warranty uses this company ...
and their service is horrible.
they wouldn't fix my tenants refrigerator, because the "coils needed cleaning"  ...
newsflash, nobody cleans refrigerator coils, and they know that.
just a simple excuse not to repair the appliance.
communication is key!
when i'm sat i expect someone over within 15 minutes!
what in the world i don't think i have ever in my life
rude and arrogant waiter.
doesn't have the decency to talk properly.
doesn't matter how the food is.
service is so horrible.
will not be going here again.
very uncaring and not loving.
your visit are less than 10 min .
pregnancy is a special time and you want to be treated with care.
not a fan.
i would stick with malleys chocolates everytime.
some of the products are to over the top like there cupcakes.
they were very short and rushed me through my decision.
must have been to busy for my order.
there is so many other choices so i will not be going back.
we've been going to this place for a couple years now.
we gave them another chance, but it was a mistake.
he lives in the house, so he couldn't have gotten it from being outside.
that will be the last time we go to this place.
and my normal hula bowl...
but i was questioning if the makai bowl usually comes this empty.
check out the comparison in both bowls.
my hula was equally leveled but the makai bowl was not full at all!
what a disappointment.
it went down and allegiant air could care less about what we were told.
i am not sure how they happened to go down after we scheduled.
my husband and i called them to get an estimate on a garage door.
it took them 2 months to come out to look at what we wanted.
then it took an additional 6 months to get a half butt estimate.
i'm unimpressed with their salesmanship, company, reply time, ect...
be cautious when dealing with cox doors!
3 people in lobby and 2 hours have already elapsed.
i advise another urgent care.
they are unfriendly, lack personal skills and quite rude.
they tell you it's 10-15 minutes and you end up waiting 1 hr plus!
i've watched them many times being rude to customers!
i'm shocked they're still in business!
seems like a nice place until i checked out.
i paid another's bill of $60 plus my $30.
i was charged $130.
i admit i was feeling the effects of their awesome margaritas.
i did ask how $60 and $30 = $130.
too wasted to fight it.
seems like they took advantage of the situation.
so, no way to dispute it.
this restaurant, however, was anything but great.
visited tonight on labour day.
disappointed, sub par, mediocre food.
if you ever had authentic vietnamese food, you'd know how bad this place is.
over priced, food not authentic.
needless to say the more i went the shittier the meals were prepared.
my last 4 meals were lacking.
i always asked for two extra tortillas which they did until last 4 meals.
don't know what happen.
wont be going there anymore.
the place was empty!
i mean, i guess i can't expect anything more from a place like this.
service was horrible and food was just ok.
it was a friday night and there were maybe 10 tables of people.
wonder what would happen if they were busy?
didn't seem like anyone had been trained or wanted to work there.
only went because i had a bucky book coupon.
will not make that mistake again.
crappy driving school, all fake reviews written by their instructors.
never learnt anything there.
waste of money and time
plus: long waiting time alert: prepared for more than half hour of waiting time
ordered take-out yesterday.
on a positive note, the vegetarian spring rolls were excellent.
all-in-all a very disappointing meal.
too bad - i remember when this was an excellent restaurant.
i don't know what's happened to this inglewood classic?
we have a regal card membership and are frequent movie goers.
the last few times at phillips place location have been extremely unsatisfactory .
they are totally understaffed.
this past memorial day weekend was unbelievable.
senior management needs to reassess their business strategy.
i would give less than one star if that were an option.
very bad experience!!.
gone for dinner.
every dish is over priced!!.
ordered hyderabadi chicken biriyani ($19) and got basmati rice filled with chicken tikka masala.
the chicken pieces were boneless and it is not dum biriyani.
surprised!!...so how the hyd biriyani is made??...
don't go to this restaurant since everything is overpriced and don't have any standards.
rude front desk.
i have been here twice and they just rush you in the appt.
i asked if i can have a monday appt.
she said we don't have any.
and her response was i don't have any mondays.
i said i thought you were open mondays?
just overall rude customer service and not helpful at all.
going to another place.
this place is disgusting, just killed about 10 little roaches in the kitchen.
hair and bugs in the bathroom, a used bandaid under the seat cushion.
stay away, far away!
once on we didn't even get beverage service.
she had no idea what she was doing !!
and had an attitude with me for it !!
this place doesn't get that idea !!!
the salad sounded great so any kind of vegetable substitute would have been possible.
so instead i order the plain, basic mushroom flatbread with onion and feta cheese.
the service was fine, nothing exceptional.
honestly if you have the option or time to go somewhere else, take it.
made reservation for 2 at 12pm.
waited for 50 min, table is still not yet ready.
suggested sharing table with other ppl but was refused by receptionist!
i was unable to get ahold of them on a prepaid voucher.
what a tragic example of the american small business!
shame on you maid affordable for having such poor business practices!!
i don't recommend this place and would never return to this place.
just about as bad of an experience as you can get.
no idea how to fade (blend) your hair from shorter to longer.
when i said no thanks she informed it was part of the fee.
i asked what the fee and my mouth dropped.
gentlemen, run from this place!
overpriced rush job!
the lady cut me while doing my nails pedicure was well below average!
horrible service, would give 0 stars if possible.
don't go here, many many better options to eat in montreal.
avoid this place at all costs!
i'm moving back from out of state and had to switch my license back.
don't use this one.
came here for lunch and had the salmon ...
actually attempting to eat it now as i am writing this review.
their lunch menu consists of 30 items none of which are appetizing.
disappointed in leaving this place still hungry ...
the wi-fi is terrible at this location.
even when there is no one in it.
been coming here fur years and it's never gotten fixed..
please pass it on and get it fixed.
also bathrooms are always dirty
but, sadly, they are not accommodating to vegans.
i went to this location midday on a monday for an oil change.
this is a oil change express station with two servicing stations.
there was one vehicle being serviced when i arrived.
the walmart tire and lube express down the street got me right in.
gave this place a number of tries.
i have bought two turntables here and one cheap receiver.
the receiver broke literally the moment i plugged it in.
no big deal it cost around $15-20 and was very low end.
i got burned three times and i will not be back.
sunday, june 29, i called in a take-out.
a bbq chicken meal and an order of ribs.
well, the chicken was sooo tiny that it hardly fed one.
plus it was very dry.
the ribs were not much better and the two orders were 40.00.
oh my, what has happened to famous dave's?
i used to really like their foodwell, not any more
seriously, the best part of the meal was the bread.
two weeks after the purchase they started saying i owed them more money.
either way i have now hired an attorney to help fight for me.
i do not recommend this dealership!
dealerships are a dime a dozen and i suggest finding one that is honest.
if you stop in here please keep moving on, i wish i had.
last night we arrived at 6:00 pm as a party of 6.
at 8:15 we were still waiting for a table.
we finally walked out the door at 8:30 and were never seated.
i strongly recommend never going here.
i've been to this place many many times but i will never go again.
i got food poisoning.
absolutely disappointed and no intention of trying again.
service was pathetic,  our server never checked on us.
they were out of diet coke.
the decor was urban shabby chic meets thift store.
pizza was tasteless hardly any cheese.
don't waste your time and money,  there's plenty of other great places in phoenix.
outrageously expensive for average work!
the owners are not particularly  friendly, and seemingly uninterested in customer satisfaction.
i will  not use them again.
rude and unhelpful.
way to run a business guys.
apparently they don't need your money.
took my business to spoonflower instead.
(as should you)
food is good, but service is sub par.
they were out of dos equis draft.
this is the third time i've been there that they were out.
it's 5:30 on a saturday.
how can you be out of mexican beer in your restaurant?
they leave dirty tables for like 30 min.
need to remove "walk ins welcome".
wet floors at dinner time that smelled horrible.
i thought what is he talking about??
overall a terrible meal.
go to any other burger joint!!!!
a most disappointing evening!
we spoke to the manager,no apology only an excuse that they were very busy.
arrived at 4 pm on a monday.
could count 6 patrons total in the entire restaurant.
waited 30 minutes to be greeted at our table.
never received the drinks we ordered.
1 server in the entire restaurant.
when our food arrived, it was burnt to a crisp.
what a mess.
she just kept cutting and cutting and cutting!
way shorter than i asked for.
i feel like she was on drugs or something.
buffet food not bad - prime rib great.
casino is problematic with server problems.
no announcements, explanations, excuses, or rationale.
arrogance and an attitude it is not happening and is just status quo.
it is not.
patrons have voices and choices and i would recommend go elsewhere.
back in the day as terribles this never happened.
don't know what changed but it is a step backwards big time!
me and my coworkers ordered mr. hunan's in tempe at 10:30.
at 12 they brought 2/3 orders.
don't ever eat there!
she was by far the rudest manager i've ever "met".
when my wife politely requested that they open it they refused again.
this sealed it.
she looked at me very nastily and said "i don't know!".
she seemed very angry at life in general.
i told her that the attitude was unnecessary.
she comes back with, "do you want to stay here tonight, huh!!??
wow- i am speechless!!!
horrible and un professional experience with this company.
hugely unprofessional service and they continue to not deliver on their own contracted responsibilities.
this place suuuucks.
it smells terrible in there.
it was very expensive and i felt sick afterwards.
i heard the manager yelling at an employee, very unprofessional.
i won't be back.
you service sucks.
i literally watched your manager and employees discuss their schedules and who was closing..
i hope steve and mike figure out who's working today #suck
i guess a new disability.
complaints seem to go nowhere now.
they need to understand that the handicap laws ensure equal access, not priority.
nurses do not have basic skills of being able to communicate effectively.
been their twice, got super bad service for the both visited.
they did not accommodate me nor apologize for my inconvenience.
the $5 went to $6, now they're charging for the deductions.
lc, you're starting to lose your street cred!
lol this hefe is such a joke.
she then argued and told us to leave the table.
don't waste your time with this establishment.
first time here!!
got home and it was a small plate of food.
dry rice and not much flavor.
i won't be going again.
i have been going to this place for years.
when you try to call and ask someone about it, they never answer.
the food here is simply disgusting, there is no other way to describe it.
everything tasted spoiled and i ended up throwing everything out.
avoid this horrible restaurant like the plague!
we were told our wait for a golf spot was 30 minutes.
so we went to the bar to have a drink.
we were so frustrated that we ended up asking for a refund and leaving.
website sucks, employees suck and pizza sucks!
will never recommend to anyone
the phone said they closed at 11pm.
why would a company schedule pick-ups after they close?
possibly the worst cut experience i've had in my life.
he didn't listen to anything i said.
and just did whatever he felt like.
and even that was done horribly.
just a complete mess.
and when i mentioned anything to him politely, he would argue with me.
this is the worst that i've ever been to.
no privacy, we were right in front where people walking in could see you.
they should have at least put the shade down.
i left there feeling as stressed as i was walking in.
terrible service, all they wanted was a tip.
not worth the groupon i purchased.
they didn't even explain the detox process.
don't waste your money here..
i had a cajun fish taco, white rice, and cajun beans.
this was the most bland fish taco i have ever had.
stick to rubio's.
dropped by el pollo loco on 12-16-17, 45 minutes before closing.
the entire restaurant was ready for closing.
clearly el pollo loco closes at 9:00 p.m. on saturdays, not 10:00 p.m.
this place is really bad.
packages get lost and never make it on time.
the customer service simply says anything to get you off the phone.
not sure why rei is using this last rate service.
yah, so in town from denver.
thought this place looked cool.
wouldn't let me in because i was wearing flip flops.
seriously, you know you are in phoenix right?
get over yourself!
it was 2pm...
great customer service.
conversely, i then stopped by the goodyear on rainbow/russell.
the guy was friendly and got me right in.
same company, two completely different customer service styles.
stayed at the grandview for my daughter's final cheer competition of the year.
i've attached my letter to management and their repsonse:
horrible service, manager was extremely arrogant and rude.
no paying customer should be treated so poorly by the manager of the restaurant.
the food was greasy and overpriced.
for a vegetarian restaurant, the food was anything but healthy.
horrible horrible service.
it was like we were bothering them.
i don't understand.
i work customer service everyday and i know how to treat customers,  not here.
the management needs to seriously look at how people are being treated here.
because her attitude stinks, first time in this location and definitely my last.
first of all, the guy who checked us in was very rude.
secondly, the course was dirty with goose poop all over.
we will not golf at that course ever again.
if you want friendly, fast, affordable service the i strongly recommend you shop elsewhere.
customer service isn't anywhere in the owners vocabulary either.
her staff proved to be rude and untrained.
run, don't walk away from this establishment.
heard some good things - but most definitely wouldn't recommend.
unfriendly & does not keep its word.
what was the purpose of scheduling the appointment without the part.
this place is and has been going down hill.
i took the day off for this appointment.
this place is the worst place to get scrubs!!
the gentleman working was clueless and very inconsiderate!!
this customer service is awful!!
thanks for ripping me off!!
one of the most disgusting hamburgers out there.
i regret not sending it back.
our food was just ok.
but, i understand the sometimes need to change.
the store ladies were helpful but this store is a huge waste of time.
they did not have most of the styles.
some of the other customers in the store had the same problem too.
really people look close.
expensive drinks that are weak unless you pay $24 for a double.
food is a lame americanized version of mexican.
they've ruined a culture on their plates.
forgive us (and them) mexico.
tomato sauce on a chili rellano?
worst service ever.
maritzas office and they said that "they were too busy to fax".
they didnt get this fax done for 4 days.
do not go here.
worst experience ever!
where i live.
i wouldn't recommend them to,my worst enemy.
everytime i go something is messed up.
the staff is nice nasty, when you point out what's been done wrong.
if i could give a negative star i would.
how does on repeatedly mess up a coffee order?!
i'm floored at how this place has good reviews.
popped in for a lunchtime meal and i'm having major regrets.
won't be back
worst customer service ever!!
took 20mins just to order water, the place was not busy.
they added 18% graditutity charge.
(way too much for shitty service) food was good but that's about it!
this was a disappointment for sure will not be back!
worst experience ever!
we finally get greeted and we receive our bread about 3 min later .
we order chicken strips and spinach artichoke dip.
2nd time dining here.
(or trying to).
i had asked for a booth.
so much for ever getting our business again!
such high hopes, and the food might be amazing.
i couldn't tell you.
4 of us went on a saturday night.
there were 2 tables with patrons outside and 2 inside.
we were seated right away....
and then completely ignored.
after 15 minutes without a word to us we left.
planned to come for a friends birthday.
so embarrassing for them!!!
good luck gold spike!
ur a joke.
no restaurant, order from bar.
this is a $6.00 cheesecake!
i should get a candy bar from the vending machine.
i love las palmas grocery stores; the restaurant is interminable.
over an hour wait for our uninspired meals.
the wait staff was apologizing for the delay.
the manager gave us a 20% discount without talking to us.
what, you don't want to face your customers???
giving my group of 6 a $12 discount don't do diddly.
the guacamole was good, the burritos starchy and the posole a disappointment.
until there are a dozen or so positive reviews, stay away.
my friend posted on their facebook page and they immediately removed it.
their appetizer cod-fish has a fish-bone for a stick.
the stick of this cod-fish was brittle inside of the fish.
she only noticed; sliced provolone (cheese) as being their italian product.
i have not visited this location but trusting my friend's experience; i never will.
lame and pathetic.
unfortunately these employees are not witty, they are just rude and incompetant.
we walked up and the hostess was having a conversation with another co-worker.
i want to start by saying this used to be my favorite place.
they said ew and gave us 92 cent discount.
i know mistakes happen but a bug in our food!?!?
i'm so mad our sushi spot is now ruined for date night.
the fact that we had to pay for our full meal is crazy.
they handled this situation very badly!
we decided to grab something quick so we stopped into this arby's.
the line for walk up order was long as well.
every employee working looked like high school students with no directions.
they were obviously under staffed for a saturday afternoon.
it took us 15 minutes total  to order and receive our food.
do not buy from them!!!
a month later, no bed and no refund.
i will be filing a claim through amazon today.
i would definitely not buy from this fraudulent company.
i  wanted to enjoy a meal with my boyfriend and friend.
rather than eat inside and be disrespectful to the establishment i sat outside.
not to mention there are dogs sitting outside!!
if i could give a zero i would!
find a new job if you don't want to deal with people!!!!
there was no line in front of me.
had an appointment scheduled for noon.
arrived 15 minutes early and waited for over an hour.
i never saw the clinic physician because no one ever came out.
words cannot describe how unacceptable and unreasonable this is.
i will never come back.
update: i decided to come back for a flu shot.
my appointment was scheduled for 9:30am and again no one is here.
christin (the bartender) was very rude and belittling.
i ordered a water and left.
i was so disappointed i ended up going to another restaurant to eat.
had my initial piercing done there and it was a great experience.
i went back months later because i had questions about my piercing.
when i started asking questions, they all spoke to me condescendingly.
there were 2 other customers who were there that had great customer service.
i ended up leaving, needless to say i'm not going back there.
this place doesn't even deserve one star.
shariff is a total scam.
he never showed up or even responded.
so i made a video & took pictures since he didn't showed up.
then he said he has 30 days to send it out.
what a joke of a company
we came here for a birthday dinner of 9 people.
the food came out more than an hour after we ordered.
the food actually taste good but not worth the wait.
there are another 5 people in the restaurant and did not order that much.
i can't stand the service here.
they have all my information mixed up.
isn't this what i pay for???
can't wait to switch to a different provider.
the lack of skill required to work at this fine establishment is amazing.
i would steer clear of at all possible, unless you like torment and anguish.
my 2 issues with this place is the price and the wait time.
oh but that's even more.
$12 dollars for shellac on your nails and $4 dollars for one nail replacement.
no signs posted as to cost to have shellac polish on your toes.
never again the prices are ridiculous.
nope, not what you think.
live and learn.
the employees were rude and arrogant.
i bought a raspado there, and it was disgusting.
never waisting my time or money in that disgusting/unfriendly place.
literally zero stars.
the "boy" actually said to me "yeah?" when i ordered !
i felt i was intruding on "their" time!
always the same low low standards!
this is for the location..
the name of this establishment is mispelled, it should be poor.
poor service, poor food quality and poor dining experience!
rubbery chicken and mushy rice.
don't you think that it kinda the first clue to do something about it??
here is a hint, stopping using frozen chicken laden with water.
won't be back, ever!
grease and salt overload.
i love good cheesesteak but this one is gross.
you have in this area much better choices.
jimmy johns is great.
the service is terrible.
i watched a server sweeping scraps of meat onto the floor behind the counter.
no one seems to know how to do their job.
it certainly wasn't good enough to make up for the horrible customer service.
you lost me as a customer after my very first visit.
so bad i didn't even get to eat !!!!!!!!!hope your not in a hurry.
i'm downgrading this review of pep boys on 2754 e.
bell road from 2 stars to 1 star.
i'll never do business with pep boys again.
poor customer service and poor quality repair.
i hate this store and the one on bell !!!!!!
they rip you off , when you trade in ....
always messy , always all over the place never again !!!
i unluckily ended up with you that day.
i was trying to save you from humiliation, but here they are.
everyone meet randy g.
don't waste your $$.
$12.41 for the market salad...
it's not even that big.
plus it was slightly edible, not good.
the amount of chicken was minuscule.
not good at all!
the staff was really nice though
my wife was super embarrassed.
the same lady charged me for a cup of water!!!
yeah we won't be back.
starving on the way home and bojangles is the only option coming from uptown.
it was 10:26 and tried to order something.
"we're out of chicken." um, what?
i guess i'm a glutton for punishment.
both times i've gone the coffee was luke-warm.
i was extremely disappointed with both the arrangement and the service.
i ordered an arrangement to be delivered on saturday.
it was delivered on monday, to the wrong address.
sorry to say, i would not deal with this merchant again.
i do not think they rate even one star!
here for the first time.
apparently az law's do not apply here at this venue.
i had never been here before for a carwash...probably won't go back.
most probably go for the food.
confusing for first time users, not clear where to pull up and pay.
employee had to run my $ into the store.
this the worse barber shop ever.
barber dre straight disrespectful asf!
really bad service, very unfriendly and indifferent staff.
we got four people visited this restaurant this saturday.
there were roughly 5 tables available (totally around 10)with only one marked reserved .
will never come again nor recommend to anyone.
the workers were completely disrespectful to me and my friends.
would not give us water cups or even a smile.
being paying customers i expect to be treated with respect.
never coming to this establishment again.
it was awful.
it felt like i was in a nursing home.
the staff was very nice did not have any issues there.
i was really bothered by this practice.
she made me extremely uncomfortable and the entire appointment felt weird.
that being said, i will be looking elsewhere for my healthcare needs.
i will never rent from advantage again!
customer service is absolutely horrible!
i will pay double to rent from another company, i don't care.
zero stars if i could give it!
by the way, all the other reviews seem to complain about a long wait.
pretty upset, showed up half an hour before close and buddy wouldn't serve me.
couple infront of me ordering was his last customers apparently.
can i give zero stars??
literally the worst service.
if you hate your job find another one way to lose business.
upper management wondering why you have money loss look at your employees.
the service was extremely slow and impolite.
the price is too high for what you get for.
we were still hungry after spending $80 for dinner.
will not go back again.
ordered takeout from here for the first time and will never again.
it was super bland and very oily.
they also gave my vegan boyfriend the wrong tofu dish with pork in it.
save yourself the calories and don't eat here.
i ordered two sets of locks.
they arrived in two shipments in two weeks.
upon opening, the locks were dented and rusted.
what kind of customers service it is?
never ever buy from them.
i walk in alone for lunch and wait at the front to be seated.
i should have walked out when the waiters ignored me.
the chicken cashew lunch special tasted like last week's leftovers.
this establishment is therefore most veteran unfriendly.
would not use this company at all.
they should rebrand to "pay more and be cranky".
i will never rent from this company again.
i am so glad we are leaving and never coming back to this place.
the waiter billy is the most obnoxious server i've ever had.
i hope he didn't think that was a compliment because i sure don't.
he didn't even back off when we made it clear we were a couple.
i even left a voicemail, and nobody has returned my call.
i will not be using their services.
the bartenders are awful!
i never leave reviews, but do not order from this restaurant.
we didn't receive the food until 9 pm.
absolutely horrible customer service-- find another restaurant that respects their customers.
this is unfortunately ridiculous i'll never ever go there again!!!!
first off the hostess was not very nice.
throwing our menus down and walking away.
we ordered some chicken strips that tasted like fish!
we will not be returning.
i went to the knights game on sunday january 7th.
this happens all game and is never a problem.
it has never been a problem.
all the while there are literally a thousand fans doing this very thing.
the manager wasn't very accommodating.
i don't recommend going to this one.
aside from paying them via credit card i have signed nothing.
i was told i would receive emails with information i needed.
if i could give zero stars, i would.
this place has to be the worst doctor's office i have ever been to.
apparently whoever i scheduled with didn't really make my appointment.
and then the kitchen closed.
don't waste your time and money like i did.
look up mark fugit orthodics.
he custom makes them for your feet at less than 200!
i obviously miss cali mexican food.
no reason to be greedy on food that a customer is paying for.
very disappointed as we thought this should have been amazing.....gosh we were totally wrong......
i am disappointed in the fact that this place is filthy.
not just surface dirt but total grunge.
the bathroom was really disgusting.
i am certainly open to giving this place another try.
the owner should give this place a good scrubbing.
it was the worst ayce sushi that i have ever been to.
the sushi's were overly sized.
the quality of the rice was really bad.
i will never go there again.
they were so limited compared to the ones i am used to in california.
i wish we had a better whole food close by.
you can get the same chinese buns at other bakeries at a better price.
if i could give it zero i would.
they sneak nickel and dime you at every chance.
you can find nice places for cheaper.
do not sign with bankier.
actually the worst.
not even 1 hour later they ran out of the chicken!
and it turned out to be about 60 to about 70 ppls that came.
the beans and rice were very bland.
and they served very small portions.
the lady kept coming over and telling us it was to loud.
what a disappointment!
the overall i wouldn't do another party here..
food is always fantastic, but for the last year the service has been horrible.
three years ago we found this hidden gem and the service was good.
unfortunately the service is getting worse every time we come in.
the servers are just unfriendly and seem angry at the world.
not sure the food is worth putting up with the service anymore, saddens us.
spent thousands more than car's value.
life risky defects.
car won't work now.
service was extremely slow and the food wasn't really my type.
i couldn't even drink their bubble tea because it tasted out of the ordinary.
i probably won't even come by here again
this is most certainly the worse chinese i have had in az.
i would honestly describe this food as a really bad pei wei knock off.
if you want anything even remotely authentic go somewhere else!
online ordering is a bit confusing.
kept me waiting well past the scheduled pickup time.
worst customer service ever !!!!
he is the true definition of why sprint sucks in the first place.
not a fan.
rice overcooked and mushy, fish gritty (frozen) and poor quality.
"fusion" contemporary maki...
too much fried/deep fried.
came here today despite the bad reviews and i'm sorry we did.
i had to get up and tell the hostess to please find out waitress.
she finally came by 5 minutes after that.
such a horrible experience.
we left 15 minutes ago and went through the drive through at arby's.
the decor is cute that's what the one star is for.
the not yo momma's pot pie was definitely not my momma's.
all this for just under $60.00 for 2 adults and i child.
run in the opposite direction!
veggie burgers suck.
decided to try something new today...
i totally regret that decision.
i won't be visiting there again...
and all this was almost 50.00!!!!!
our waitress was brutal, worse ever.
food was meh.
do yourself a favor and go elsewhere!
the grilled tandoori chicken was pink inside and blander than a jewel cd.
actually, the word bland encapsulated pretty much all of the food i had there.
and don't forget the oil.
oh, the oil.
no place settings - had to steal from empty table.
dough wasn't cooked all the way, cold and doughy in spots with hot toppings?
frozen pizza kinda quality.
salads were drenched in dressing to the point of soggy lettuce.
well i'm still hoping to work something out with this business.
i'm sure they hope this will all just go away eventually.
perfect example of buyer beware.
i will never go there again nor would i recommend this place to anyone!
ultimate worst airline ever!
delays with no explanations, no compensations.
you get what you pay for.
never taking this airline again.
wasted half my weekend at the airport waiting for the flight to take off.
customer service is something that keeps businesses going in this country.
that ideal is not displayed at all at this usps.
i work in mckeesport myself so i'm familiar with the cliental in the area.
poor customer service in any area is a shame.
i left this location and went to the ups store in white oak.
never again will i go back to this post office again.
my husband and i ordered two pizzas from this place.
so incredibly bad we thought it was a joke.
update: owner wrote to me saying that we have not been there.
extremely rude and condescending.
i have always had a great experience here in the past.
the reception was not only rude but uninformed.
the attitude seemed like they felt they were "above" the community they were in.
i challenge you to find a telephone number and address for a corporate office.
they don't provide it because they don't want you to find them.
delhi palace does not have it in them.
in general, the servers sound rude and they don't look happy to serve you.
i really really wanted to like this place.
but first off the windows are very dirty...
not a good sign.
and secondly the cleaning products smell was so offensive i lost my appetite.
makes one suspect that they are masking something.
the yogurt was just okay.
i have never seen such rude and horrible customer service.
just overall horrible customer service!
coffee was not the great either.
only thing good was that it is open 24 hours but never coming back.
this show is terrible!!!!!!!!!
i fell asleep.
no tricks, no stunts, terrible dancing, and boring boring boring.
the dryers are horrible don't work well.
didn't hear anything for two days and the pie clothes were stained pink.
never going back.
while my wife's mussels were great, the steak that i had wasn't.
the frittes were strikingly similar to mcdonald's french fries.
we live near by so we stopped in to give it a try.
the food is worse than denny's if you can believe it.
everything is made a week in advance so it's all stale.
horrible customer service.
picked up other items from the back.
just cancelled it and returning the rest of the stuff to them.
do not go here, they will just cause you headaches.
that's the right information...
he came to me not i went to him...thank you for prolonging my divorce.....grrrrr
wasn't too impressed first time around, thought i'd give it a second chance.
the food was subpar, oily, low quality mexican, yuck.
i will never go back!
eat there at your own risk!
rolls were good and that's the best i can say about this place.
everything came out burnt.
atmosphere was lame and so were the servers.
plain jane central.
this restaurant seemed to be on the outs based on what i saw.
don't go here.
terrible...terribletrying to be a ??????
stick to what your roots not
i will never go to another one of her sales again!
i'll keep it simple!
i hate my haircut!
i didn't realize how uneven my hair was until i got home.
never have i witnessed such a corrupt and disorganized restaurant.
serve customers on a first-come first-serve basis, not through bribes and favoritism.
more like very disappointed.
this place is a ghost town that smells like dirty diapers.
the parking lot can be a bit scary and sketchy.
everything else is equivalent to shops you would come across in a swap mart.
skip this mall, you won't miss anything!
it ended up a fizzy mess.
what a waste.
i will never come back to eat here.
this place should just be a bar and not serve food.
which the food was bad.
the service was just as bad.
i sat at the bar.
the restaurant was dirty and the service was incredibly slow.
the employees at jimmy johns were amazing, happy and provided very quick service.
i went on the weekend with some friends.
the service was ok but the food wasn't worth it.
i got the lille fluk thing and steak frittes to share.
the steak was ok could have used  more flavour.
overall it just wasn't worth it.
i wouldn't eat there again.
i had a rental reservation 12/21/16 thru 12/30/16, confirmation number h1163089268.
after arrival i had upgraded the vehicle to a premium suv.
there was no snow brush provided either.
this was in no way a premium rental vehicle experience.
i would never recommend dollar car rental.
and the ones who were not twerking were laughing like crazy.
what has happened to this place
towards the end of our meal, the fire alarm went off.
the alarm is super loud it made my head hurt.
however after 10 minutes, they don't know the code to stop the alarm.
i don't think they know the procedure.
fucking trash ass lying cashiers.
very rude don't give a finna about customer service.
recommend wendy's across the joint
i think name was brianna.
i don't remember, i will not be coming back fo this location.
they're lucky i'm giving them a star!
never going back there again!
this restaurant seems to have tried to minimize overhead costs.
waiter looked bored out of his mind.
15$ wasted on this buffet.
this is the worst delivery service ever!!!
i'm talking at least 5 days late.
but no, not them, they say "undeliverable address", really?
then how is it i get mail everyday & packages from everyone but them?!?!
i cannot fathom how anyone could rate this beyond two stars.
the service is incredibly rude and unprofessional.
pitbulls with bowel obstructions are more pleasant.
not quiet, near liquor stores with questionable miscreants milling about.
avoid at all costs!!!
there was half of a roach attached to the crust of the pizza.
the other remains was scattered around the box.
i had to throw away the pizza.
hopefully i get a refund.
a few of the girls there tonight had terrible attitudes!
the big guy named chris was cool.
talked to him for a minute, seems like a solid dude.
won't be back tho, so i wish him well, and only him.
been coming here for a while but no more!
had a horrible experience here yesterday with a very unprofessional manager.
try zips sports grill instead.
my first question was are you accepting new patient?
response: hmm yeah with a not so nice tone.
second question do you accept cigna?
uhhh yeah, hold on a minute.
before i could say anything i was placed on hold.
no no no!!
i will not be scheduling a appointment here.
unless raw chicken is your bag, i say skip coming to the arrogant butcher.
the dish was $23, so that really did not remedy the situation.
we will definitely not be returning to this establishment.
in a few words.
eat anywhere else, not here.
food is overpriced and uninspired.
wait staff is detached.
signature consultants is a useless recruiting agency.
so far i have been contacted by 3 people.
why should i waste my time if i don't even know what it's about?
where is the job?
what is the job?
where is the description?
there goes my 1 star review for a 100% useless employment agency.
this conservative pos rag makes faux news look like npr.
no one reads it, the post gazette is the real newspaper in this city.
what a shit hole.
..can't believe this place is open..
.dishes are big.
as a parent i showed up when instructed to by the staff.
i had to pay $100 for the third visit.
i let that go & figured was a mistake.
when i went again, ordered different item & same result.
little to no meat.
i will not be going back.
thieves , thieves, thieves....
horrible service, loud & crummy ambience & mediocre food.
very poor service.
not the employees fault but it is what it is.
disappointed because the rio is a solid hotel for the most part.
i'm gonna have to agree with queenie on this one, bleah!!!!
subs were just ok, and the bread was stale for me too.
this really bothers me considering how much the ingredients cost.
one little girl checked me out and took payment, hmmm.
this was the most miserable experience at a fast food restaurant ever!!!
it literally took them 15 minutes just to take our order!!
then they were missing some our food when we received our bags.
they also never gave us the dip for my french dip & swiss sandwich!!!!
my family(15+ ppl) and i came yesterday to celebrate a baptism and my birthday.
the waitress was badgering us appetizers/soups but we didn't know that it was extra....
however, the lack of customer service pissed me off.
that is not how you treat a customer.
we are never going back because of how we were treated.
overall: the food gets a 3/5 and customer service gets -2/5.
i hope they don't treat other customers like that.
chips and salsa cost $5 with no refills on small portions.
pitcher of margaritas suppose to fill 4 glasses, didn't even fill 3.
food marginally ok.
won't be back.
service was rarely offered.
we got here at 6:30 and they were out of stuffed mushrooms.
they ran out of take out boxes for the unflavored, bland chicken picatta.
the rigatoni, while the portions were lots, it wasn't anything to write home about.
i called to schedule a wax app 11/10 and i purchased a groupon.
about five months ago from my husband .
farida rassiwala was unprofessional and rude.
she ought to be reeducated about the patient's bill of rights.
first line states, "be treated with dignity and respect".
she disregarded that with me.
she just wanted her day to be over with.
you can either take a smoking room or pay us for the upgrade".
this is the third time something like that has happened...we will not be back!!
i have been coming here over twenty years the food is great.
i told the manger she was too busy was her response.
she was three feet away.
now the restaurant is charging for salsa refill.
my how things have changed.
i love their food but won't be back due to sanitation.
it is a sad day!
i told them to stay out and i'd take my business elsewhere.
every single time i go to this location they are soooo far from friendly!!!
this definitely must not be emphasized in their training.
i ordered the crab cakes.
they weren't very flavourful.
you can get better deal in other bbq joint at jones ave.
the quality of duck was so-so, very little duck meat and too grease.
i can't convince myself to come back anytime soon.
further, phone calls to ask questions about treatment were not returned.
the whole place is a big mill organized to make money for the practice.
stay away from westfield.
if i could give a 1/2 star i would.
donot wase your hard earned money.
ate there this am two omelets at our table.
neither had but a tablespoon of ingredients and was cold.
bread highly buttered and the butter could not melt as toast was cold.
the only thing hot was the water for tea.
not going back!
dirty rooms, rude staff, phoned house keeping several times but never comes.
beds are uncomfortable, toilet doesn't always flush.never staying here again
we had another company come out they changed a fuse and started it up.
we put 170 into minor parts and used it last night.
the pool service charged $85 for coming and wanted a minimum of 500 more.
just disappointing from every angle.
poor service, dirty, incompetent staff and terrible food.
management is to blame.
if you do land here.
do not eat the kangaroo!
what a complete rip off!
i ordered two dinner bento boxes at $20 each.
one of the worst values i have had in vegas.
absolute terrible service today when i had lunch here.
won't be going back here anytime soon.
this old navy has the most unprofessional staff i've encountered.
probably the worst representation of leadership and old navy possible.
rude in person.
stores a mess.
will never return or recommend.
isn't there a class action suit against them for this crap?
do not use centurylink for phone, internet, tv services.
they are a bunch of liars that cannot live up to their promises.
shame on them!!
really not even 1  star.
the staff here is totally inept.
oh my goodness.
my fiance and i went here to grab a quick breakfast.
i was so wrong.
the donut holes we ordered tasted more than two days old.
i will never go here again.
there was no mention of this upon pick up.
cancellations received within 151 days will result in 100.00% forfeiture of your deposit.
but any casino/hotel that does this will get a 1 star from me.
we ordered pizza from this place.
when we opened the pizza box we found ants in the box.
horrible customer service.
if i could give 0 stars for quality of service, i would.
it took 30 minutes for one order and 45 minutes for another.
when we spoke to the waiter and mentioned that, he walked away.
didn't even acknowledge it.
a simple "sorry it took so long" goes a long way.
do not recommend, lots of other good taiwanese cafes around markham.
i believe new management has taken over.
increased prices, decreased quality.
spicy burger was a regular burger lathered in hot sauce.
i would recommend spending your hard earned money elsewhere.
went to hotties for the first time!
she didn't like it!
so i figured i just exchange it for a different one!
so the purchased i made they stamped it final sale!
so i couldn't exchange it!
i left it in the counter and said i won't be back!
i should have known walking in there were no customers just before christmas!
tell tell sign of their business!
they are no longer open for business.
save your hair.
her youthful inexperience shows.
i regret this haircut every single day.
no way to give no stars.
i was served raw chicken.
i told the waiter who said he would tell the chef.
no one came to apologize by the time i left.
place was closed with no sign of life.
might be out of business?
recommend confirming status prior to making a trip to this place.
from the minute i walked in the service and clarity of communication was awful.
sorry guys, i had high hopes for this place, but here were my experiences.....
aside from having no zing, the pork was chewy, stringy, and flavourless.
third, and unfortunately my last time, i picked up some oxtail, and curry goat.
the oxtail tasted like nothing but sugared beef.
way too sweet with little caribbean zest to it.
the goat, was a complete flip, at being way too salty....
waited in line for over an hour at 11pm on wednesday!!
it was ridiculous with little to no explanation.
they acted as though it was customers fault they had no cars ready.
will never come back again.
the decor is beautiful but my experience was not that relaxed.
she said it was a "european reflexology"i bought it on living socials.
it was supposed to be a introduction.
she didn't even ask me if the bright light could be turned down.
i felt distracted by the other clientele coming in the room.
i did not feel like my belongings would be safe in the locker.
they are over priced and not very honest.
what a waste of my money.
poor service and waited far too long for our food.
when it finally came it was lacking flavour!
they took everything, leaving broken glass and shattered remains of my life.
so please consider this before you take your business to this corporation.
get more tellers.
i do not want to spend my entire lunch hour waiting in line.
busy afternoon 2 tellers.
the food was ok, not great.
although we were able to purchase it for an additonal $14, we politely declined.
we came here expecting to pay vegas prices.
that's not even vegas prices, that's just crazy!
i will never go back to this place again.
they have the worst customer service i've ever seen.
they gave me the wrong order so i called back to tell them.
then the manager yells at me for having it like it's my fault.
i've never been so disrespected in my life.
they lost a good customer i would never be back again.
very unpleasant staff.
ok. try posting prices and we won't have to ask!
then getting served cold "hot" tea by a clearly confused waiter/waitress (?
- still not really sure what they were and i'm a physician).
i think next time i need to just grab a croissant elsewhere
so poorly run and staff are so slow.
at our first visit our truck was rented to someone else.
i was just trying to buy boxes, should it really take this long?
answer: no, no it should not.
avoid this location at all costs.
i'm not picky.
but this was tragic...
the whole meal took at least 15 minutes to come out.
we will not be returning.
when i get in the store it was a different story.
also i had to spend 25.00.
i went there for dinner around 6 on a monday night.
the line wasn't as long as i expected and it moved quickly.
we were seated within 10 minutes.
anyhow, the meal was a huge disappointment.
argh....bottom line, i wish there was a microwave to heat up my food!
not coming back at all, waste of money and time.
dried tomatoes in my tomato salad, dried out salad, black guacamole.
tried to buy a wedding gift.
they had no idea what was in the store.
they also have quit wrapping gifts.
tj maxx here i come.
why bother with parking and high prices when you get no service???
this location was horrible.
ohhh my god, this place is horrible.
if you eat here, you will smell like grease and smoke.
the food is all packaged and they microwave eggs for the love of god!!!
the owners are very cheap and the portions are very small.
i hope this place is replaced by a subway..
it will still be horrible but at least it wont cost as much.
the old owners were so much better.
i do however appreciate her phone call.
i only went in because a friend was having a birthday/friday night out.
hey, 20 mins???
and actually getting a drink might help.
we have a few spots for this one...' seriously?
we left and there was at least 50 more cars in line.
also, control the entry line...
there's cars getting in through the exit, sneaking out the line.
i usually love going here but lately it's been an absolute nightmare!
first, it's almost as bad as walmart!
hire some dang cashiers and people to check your door.
let alone standing in line for 45 min for a cashier!
i am ready to ask for my membership mo why back, service is awful!
their baked goods are good especially the icing.
however, the service is terrible!
i knew it was available.
i left without ordering anything.
i will not spend my money there no matter how good their products are!
drive thru here is probably one of the worst ones i've been through.
very very slow.
this location needs to get is act together.
that was until my horrible experience today.
i love filibertos but wont gobhere again!
ray will not return calls for warranty work!
this isn't a one and done warranty.
the second time, haven't been so lucky.
sorry but i'd rather give my business to someone who really appreciates their customers!!!
this place had an awful smell.
if you want to save money sleep in your car.
liked the atmosphere but our food took way too long (1 hour).
we had to pause in between because we finished the first few dishes.
so frustrated with at&t's horrible service!
go anywhere but at&t!!
bad experience in canada i have ever experienced with bad service, very slow dishes.
i can only pay in cash if i don't need any change
dough is under-developed and also bland.
horrible experience at encore beach club.
stupid and racist security guys at the door.
will the regional management step in?
worst einstein bagel location.
place is filthy, poor customer service.
i go back in and let them know.
i asked to speak with a manager which took another 10 minutes of waiting.
there was no apology or any acknowledgement of any type that they did wrong.
employees are rude and have no clue what good customer service is.
the service was very slow.
the waitresses were more concern about how rounchy they looked than give great service.
we had to ask several times to get our water refilled.
we will probably won't be back there again.
if i can give a zero rating, i would have.
dan is great.
otherwise avoid this place.
they overcharge and never file the insurance correctly.
do not go here.
at first i gave this place an average review..
most of it is still valid..
great band and atmosphere with little ventilation.
the security staff  needs some work.
there loss but businesses like this don't deserve a good reputation.
i hope i see the day this place goes out of business
i can't believe they would tell me such a thing!!
went here with a large group, prepaid.
service and food was unremittingly horrendous.
it took something like 55 minutes for them to prepare the salad/soup course.
when it finally arrived the salad was meh and the miso was cold.
the low point of the night came when they brought out the main course.
so they respond by taking the food back.
what were they planning to do, serve it to someone else?
paid extra for the tire shine, but tires were not touched.
subsequently promised a certificate for a free car wash.
no certificate received.
i was severely disappointed in geno's.
their food was dry and bland.
it was far from it.
i won't go there again,  and i wouldn't recommend it for anyone.
this place looks like it had a change over...
poor service wont be back ..
dont even want to give one star after seeing other reviews..yuck
me, my boyfriend and his mom went here for dinner last night.
the biscuits tasted like it was old.
expensive place to begin with but way overpriced if you can only hit irons.
been to one in wooddale, il.
great concept just not in scottsdale though.
horrible service, drove from chandler because we heard this was the best.
picked up our to go order and no noodles in the chow mein.
the way they deal with customers is horrible save your coin.
have your wedding here if you don't want your guests to be served dinner.
they legitimately never served 2 tables dinner at a wedding..
worst service ever.
i have been to numerous weddings...had my own wedding...
and have never heard of guests not being served dinner.
staff is always rude, in store and at drive though window.
they basically throw your food out the window at you.
the food is typically cold or luke warm at best.
i avoid this wendy's unless i'm really in a bind.
since i've been here only 2 people have been called to teller.
everyone in line is depositing in someone else's account.
so it's very irritating to have to wait so long for a deposit.
never will i come back to this location.
the worst customer service ever.
took a blow dryer back with the receipt that was bought in july.
won't be going back there.
not even one star.
18.99 for an exterior wash?
fabulous freddie's is only 3 miles away and totally worth the drive!
even if your down the street from both of my homes!
we had some kids going house to house offering centurylink services.
we canceled immediately!
bunch of liars!!
i don't like to give bad reviews but this experience was very bad.
don't rent here.
two staff working with 70-100 people in line waiting.
it's off the charts ridiculous.
wait time is 1-3 hours for a car- if they have any cars.
this place it double the price and a tenth of the value.
the vacuum on the right (yellow hose) didn't even have suction.
the carwash is weak and has no direction.
15 seconds into my blow dry it told me to move forward.
manager refused to honor groupon even though it's not expired.
seafood platter was dry and fried rice was tasteless.
said she shut the kitchen down already.
poor business practice.
if you want to close at 2:30, post that on your door.
the vet also had a lot of appointments coming and was "very busy".
the staff was unprofessional.
never again, sephora is way better!
the guy that runs the place is a complete scam artist.
he charged me 20 bucks for one pumpkin.
avoid this place like the plague.
they rip honest people off.
the sushi's okay, but the service is horrible.
walked in the shop because i wanted to replace my vape.
we left within a minute.
crap food, crap service.
not sure what the appeal is here.
one piece of bacon and runny eggs (ugh).
when she did resurface she smelled awful, like cigarettes.
staff is rude!
dr dao is rude and won't listen to any concerns you have.
he refused to read previous reffering ophthalmologist notes.
he checked my daughter eye and said it looks fine beside inflammation.
now let me remind you he checked her eyes in less than one minute.
uncaring doctors please pay someone else that truly care!
stay away from this place
andrea the assistant manager is very rude.
was very unpleasant that i asked to exchange a top for a different size.
no welcoming hello or have a nice day.
went in for lunch last week.
our server introduced herself and stated that another gentleman would be her partner.
our server only came by to drop off the check.
we couldn't even get boxes to go.
this location does not live up to the radisson name
bought a $300 coffee table from them a while ago.
the coffee table on display had a big scratch on it.
i stated explicitly that i would only buy if they have a new one.
also, the delivery personnel was just the owner and a staff.
filthy, overpriced, ghetto.
there was a gang fight in the lobby my first night there.
the hallways reek of cheap perfume.
my shower drain didn't work due to it being clogged with hair.
my window looked out on the wall of the neighboring hotel.
life is too short to stay at the quad.
unacceptable to me.
i definitely will not be back.
you should have had it fixed immediately or have two machines.
plus the fact i drove 20 minutes, soooooo angry.
also, terrible selection on product.
i have given them two chance and both times were a disappointment.
one star is too much for this awful place.
worst customer service.
waste of money.
worst company ever
two thumbs down!
horrible experience here.
their hours start at 7am.
i got there at 7:05.
the employee showed up at 7:30 to unlock the door.
the 5 people waiting by then, one tech.
then appointments started to show up too.
so another hour wait.
don't use them without an appointment.
the problem is the timing belt, which the car had warranty on.
go else were...
i guess i didn't learn my lesson
so yes, they have improved in terms of line waits.
eyebrows waxed and my skin was peeledoff my eyelids.
probably will leave me with scares.
i've had 4 amazon deliveries sent with ontrac.
one being a package that was due today.
the last one, still out for delivery, was due in february.
that's 4 packages that never showed up.
begged amazon to ship with any other carrier other than ontrac.
hate hate hate this company!!
this is the worse mcdonalds ever.
how does this place every time i come here get my order wrong.
worst johnny rockets you will ever experience.
we ended up demanding a refund due to waiting so long.
avoid like the plague.
i had the carpet cleaned before i left as well.
got a call on sept 5th asking if we were going to pay rent.
come to find out the good management that was there was gone.
this is the worst store.
when asking a question they all have a different answer.
i'm not at a club just trying to buy some glasses.
really lady you had one job!!!
never come back here
never flys on time and they charge you for everything.
pay double and save yourself the headache.
this airline flys junk that the faa barely approves.
md80s belong in a junk yard, not in the air.
the old guy who works graveyard is a super rude prick.
went to make a purchase in the morning before work as i usually do.
been shopping here for years and won't be back no more!!
i would not ever call them.
it is now thursday and the company has continued to give me the runaround.
probably filled with similar complaints...
i'm sorry but with integrity i can barely give this place 1 star.
sorry ambience was great food was horrible!
stay away to avoid being treated wrongfully and disrespected!
no return policy.
found out after he had arrived that he had quit smoking.
i have been to montanas several times and food was great.
my daughter and myself started to become ill the next day.
severe diarrhea and stomach cramps.
tomorrow i will be filing a complaint with the lake county health department.
came in when it was slow on a sunday night.
employees had seen us but just continued their laughing and conversation.
took them 15 minutes just to get our water.
food was subpar and is not made to order.
i was very disappointed in my first experience here and won't be back.
if i could give a 0 star i would!
worst service .
waitress took forever..
salad was dry and pizza was just gross and honestly overcooked.
won't be coming back here again
don't waste your money.
the third time should be the charm.
however, they cared so little that they didn't bother to ask my name.
there was no apology offered.
it was simply "i'll let the manager know."
my daughter was in this kinkos today to get oversized copies made.
she is a college student, and this was a shock for her.
$70 for two copies.
don't waste your time.
would not recommend to anyone, go to buffalo wild wings instead.
this is the location closest to my house.
when one of my friend ask what was the difference between lunch and dinner.
the waitress simply reply it just the price.
will not visit again!
this is the worst bait and switch experience that we have ever had.
apparently they have gone to the seinfeld school of rental.
ended up renting at alamo to get a reasonable rental car.
budget must be commission based on what they can get out of you.
we will never rent from them again.
well how can i leave after that.
also as a side note...washroom really dirty!
car has never been the same.
will never ever use them again!
our waiter was so sweet.
he did a great job.
but the food was so gross!!
red lobster is not the same anymore and over priced.
poor quality food.the manager did come to talk to us about the food.
we let him know that our food wasn't tasting like usual.
he offered us a different plate but we declined.
we just wont be back.
i have to say that the experience after visiting the facility was horrendous.
even if your visit is good it isn't worth it to be harassed afterwards!!!
i ordered a pick up and wait 1 hour( which she said 30minutes).
when i ask if my order is ready, she shouted at me?!
and the reason she yelled at me is "i'm too busy".
his answer is i have other deliveries.
he didn't even say sorry i can't wait.
worse service i have ever gotten, so disappointed
this safeway is so so so slow!!
they only ever have 1-2 checkers no matter when i go in.
so then my 20 minute quick run into the store is now 45 minutes.
played the sunrise & canyon 9's the lakes was not offered to us.
so i spent thousands of dollars on hair removal from brazilian to face.
every time i came here they tried to sell me something else.
it never did work better.
the employees are awesome, however the product isn't.
i love greek salad from showmars but i will never return to this one.
i quote " what do you want" .
the other team members look shocked and upset at his actions and manner.
they looked at us like they where sorry.
i will never return.
i left the drive-through and called the location to talk to the manager.
she was very rude, short with me in, and hung up on me.
i will never go to this location again and i hope this gets around.
animals are not disposable and someone working here should know that.
my advice is , if you are a vegetarian dont go here.
if they don't sell insurance/upgrades the company let them go.
but unfortunately this particular location sooks.
i don't think we will return since we did give it two shots.
sorry kind staff at rr.
p.s. bathroom looked like an atom bomb when off.
the server gave us 1 menu for 3 people.
didn't greet us.
we waited for 30minutes and still no service.
after all, they've hung on to my $490 for 6 months now.
i cannot believe the nerve of this builder and their employees.
look at all my yelp reviews they are mostly positive!
this restaurant is awful.
they were on top of a salad!
will never go back.
service was ok but the food was not hot.
kids chicken finger was fried for longer than needed.
no complaints on the bar side or service side.
just bad service after all
i contracted westcoast cabinets to install granite and countertops.
they are not willing to accept liability for this.
moreover, they did not pre-inspect the granite before installing.
they are saying it is natural and they cannot do anything about it.
the store advertises a  $ 15 oil change.
finally i had to say something.
but he was to busy eating i guess.
an oil change takes like 10 minutes top.
can u say shady ?
i definitely won't be back.
this you would expect with family run business.
i would recommend to hire professional folks in the front.
plenty of other options are available now so i won't be going here again.
went there in 2008 for one varicose vein..
got the ablation done..
ok .....now my vein is hurting more and buldging more...more varicose veins popping up....
:( wish i never messed with my veins......
morgan keeps telling me that the manager will call me and she does not...
but still waiting in limbo...
xmas is 1 month away and i have a 7 and 11 yr old...
thanks for ruining their christmas!!
i was really disappointed with the quality of the food, especially considering the price.
the vibe in the place was also cold.
would not recommend this restaurant.
i had the worst customer service today.
zoes kitchen hire better people at this location please.
place is a waste, go hit qdoba for a real mexican experience.
customer service = wack food = wack
i have been coming there for last 6 months.
i have had some spot of hair longer than the others.
not really visible but really not professional..
it happened two times in a row.
the staff is really terrible, barely talking to clients.
they are just chatting together planning their night out..
really too pricey for the service and the staff.
i will look for a new place.
my fist 4 sessions were a waste of time and money.
they set the treatment too low to be effective.
it took 4 sessions of my complaining before they adjusted the treatment.
at this rate, i do not expect more 3 more treatments to be sufficient.
i looked at their menu.
i saw szechuan dumplings in hot oil.
my mouth was watering.
i called to place order.
they don't have that.
oh well...back to surfing.
no service staff waited on us until we asked to be served!
this place is ghetto and treats people like they are pieces of shit........
i don't know how they have 5 star reviews on here.......
i'm not a customer of theirs....
i emailed them twice and got vague semi rude responses.
finally got a tracking number yesterday, says it hasn't even left the facility yet.
oh and i payed extra for express shipping, i don't know why.
this has been a horrible experience.
i'll have to spread the word.
do not stay here...
i made the mistake of coming to vegas during ces.
so i got stuck with the desert inn...
i slept with my shoes on people!!!
run, don't walk to anywhere else, and consider the box before staying here.
all three were bad to medicore.
the pork "tender"loin was dry and tough.
the chicken and avocado was forgettable.
the seafood fettucine was bad- watery and bland.
they did put enough seafood in though.
2 stars for the food.
but it's not.
the service was nauseatingly slow too.
this is by far the worst obgyn you can go to in vegas!
please do not go here..
we've been waiting in line for over an hour.
a party of about 50 people with "line passes" have cut the entire line.
there's zero communication between the employees and the patrons standing in line waiting.
we got here at 6:45pm because we have tickets to a 9:30pm show.
it's 8pm now and we still haven't been seated.
this is pretty ridiculous and disappointing.
we've been looking forward to eating here.
this waiting room is by far the worst i've ever been to.
waiting times are extremely long.
never ever ever go to becky gonzales.
no bedside manner.
switched to dr knapp-so far other than the aforementioned she has been ok.
apparently clean enough while we were still there to show endlessly with no complaints.
tipped way more than anyone else for a song and nothing.
don't ever tip more for a song.
tip crappy $1 for a song never tip more for a song.
they'll never play it.
they're not good!!!
i left a message this past wednesday (22nd) to ask for a quote.
i listened to rose's voice mail and gave her my information.
it is now friday and have not heard back from her.
been to c0lumbia outlets in portland, woodburn, sellwood, lake oswego and lincoln city.
what a waste of time!
absolutely the worst place in the charlotte airport.
common food, and honestly the most obnoxious and slow servers in the entire complex.
avoid at all costs.
the mexican place at the end of the b concourse is far better
i would not recommend this company.
over budget and i was very unsatisfied.
nails were left everywhere including my neighbors yard and the pool.
i had tires with severely cracked sidewalls that were still under warranty.
they dismissed the problem saying it's not bad enough to replace.
i do not feel big o cares about their customers being satisfied.
what a sh*tty place...
it says "restaurant & cafe" but don't expect to find any food here!
suffice it to say, he was extremely rude!
and despite the drake shout-outs, the place isn't all that!
i've seen way better hookah joints!
would not recommend.
i won't be buying rhis anymore.
fail taco bell.
these employees at this location are incompetent.
they can't even take simple orders or provide decent customer service.
& extra charge for the avocado that was non-existent.
my first time in scottsdale was last weekend.
the office employees never pick up the phone.
he simply asked if we had even been alive that long.
sycamore's customer service is horrendous.
don't live here.
pay extra to not live somewhere that will rip you off.
i don't like feeling nickel and dimed especially for mediocre food/drinks.
the quality and quantity has gone out the window.
it's very unfortunate for them,  as this appears to be a very busy intersection.
they are the god damn worst.
worse club ever!!
do not go here
food is not bad.
the staff aren't always nice - pesters you for the tip.
in all honesty, this was probably the worst buffet i've ever been to.
the food is worse than my dog's food!
you're better off eating street food.
there are other restaurants in the mgm that are much better, but also pricey.
the girl at the front desk was rude and unprofessional!
we walked out and didn't get a haircut for my daughter.
she had an attitude right when we walked in.
will not be going back.
first impression was terrible!
no service, sat for 40 minutes got water and tea no refills.
left without seeing server and no food.
manager too busy hanging with serving staff to check on customers.
have posted this on our community website and will never return.
horrible 14 day return policy, even on gifts.
and my product was broken when i opened it.
bull shit for such a big corporation.
i'll shop elsewhere for my electronics from now on.
hostess were so rude.
took forever for waitress to come.
i asked for a runny yolk not a raw egg.
bloody mary was nothing to write home about either.
save your money and go somewhere else.
but i shouldn't have to sacrifice receiving good service just to get a discount.
this is my first time yelping.
and she was very rude and she had a very very poor attitude....
good luck ross.
i did not will not buy from here.
son of this yelp account
ordered some flowers as a 'get well' present.
horribly customer service experience.
the worst ever and i am a power web shopper for business and home.
if you call they will lie to you about the expected delivery.
i'm a prime member too for years...maybe amazon will listen.
i give it one but really it's none !
i am so gravely disappointed with the customer service at diego pops.
i am disappointed and so confused.
boo on you, diego pops.
came here for lunch and it was horrible.
also tried the mushroom soup.
not returning and don't recommend!!
i'm not saying the food is bad, i just never received it.
who ever is manning online orders didn't see the order for two hours.
i was starving waiting for two hours for an order that was never started.
i think that is total bull crap.
they also said they'd make it up to me if i ordered again.
how do i know someone will see it this time.
i'm probably not going to order from their again.
went for lunch had the fish it was to strong like it was old.
the owner was rude he made our group feel very uncomfortable.
won't be back
my omelette was tasteless and cold .
and the infamous coffee cake......really ..
i will not return the service was poor .
the food is overpriced, and certainly not worth thedrive.
the reputation of this establishment does not meet the quality.
shows they really aren't customer service orientated.
i was instantly offended,felt violated and embrassed.
the place is called el hefe in tempe off of mill ave.
talk about shitty service.
they would have to get better to be consider bad.
p.s., this really needs a thumbs down button.
save your money and go elsewhere!
horrible food, terrible service, long wait.
still no food.
i live five minutes away.
fuck this hell hole.
what a fucking rip off.
this place is a dump!
the office is small, dirty and has lots of clutter hanging all over.
the employees are rude, obnoxious and unprofessional and the prices are ridiculous!.
i can hear everything.
although it is clean, the walls are paper thin.
i can hear the cleaning ladies speak their language outside my room.
i can hear my neighbours tv, the people having a good time upstairs..
please do not get a car from here.
i missed work because i have a bad leg and cant walk far.
i rated 1 because ii had to.
last month we visited and were seated next to the food bins.
we also noticed he had a band aid on one of his fingers.
this was enough to cause us not to eat anymore.
i don't think we will go there again.
never order take out.
these people have no idea whats going on.
nobody acknowledged me.
terrible experience, management could care less.
don't waste your time.
worst customer service ever yesterday!
i went into the south tryon, charlotte location after 5pm.
this made her move even slower, if that's possible.
there were now four people in line.
average 2 hours + wait time for scheduled appointments!!!
office staff was incredibly rude.
i just fired the doctor as my care giver.
place doesn't even deserve 1 star.
i'd strongly recommend world harvest on university in champaign as an alternative.
they do not install new never mounted tires they did not sell.
well at least that was the case for me.
still can't get it right bww...
see ya again in a year or two.
i've ordered takeout a handful of times and have been disappointed every time.
total thumbs down to this location.
you have to pay service charge to return your item!
that sucks !!
i booked the move one month in advance.
if i could give no stars i would.
i'll never set foot in there again and you shouldn't either.
no one ever came thru the drive thru while i was there.
did not leave my shirts because they then wanted $28 up front.
7/9/18 1:45 pm
do not buy your pet food at a petco location or at petco online.
everything is between $10 & $20 more expensive than anywhere else.
we are done with petco.
it was so hard to get our waitress' attention.
she forgot my friend's alcoholic drink and got her sandwich wrong three times.
seriously, a bad experience.
terrible place for breakfast.
eggs were yucky too.
my total was over $32 and i barely ate any of my breakfast.
avoid this place
most disgusting breakfast i've ever eaten in a us airport.
bacon over salty.
eggs were bland and i assume powdered.
the coffee sucked too.
they could easily do better.
do not go here!
i'm surprised there isn't police tape around this shack condemning it.
this has to be one of the filthiest restaurants i've ever set foot in.
consider yourself warned.
that really sucked!
i wouldn't come to this location again, we received such horrible service.
their speed and quality of service was trash.
if i could give them zero stars i would.
got bugs in my food-tom kha.
i would not recommend coming herewe requested no peanuts due to not allergy.
they still out it on the food.
service is very slow.
i called and talked to a manager and they refunded my total amount.
i will not be eating at any farmer boy location again.
the kitchen they use is obviously disgusting.
do not come here!!!
the staff is unbelievably rude, super over priced & horrible service.
my pedicure was just the lady painting my toes.
didn't file, scrub or do anything else!!
terrible service and ridiculous prices.
the guy sitting in the first tattoo station, treated us like shit!
i have never been to any business that was so unprofessional.
and he said, go ahead they won't let you use there bathroom either.
its a no no to live here!
manager or anyone in the office never calls you back.
they keep changing what they said the first time.
they didnt even compensate with the damages of our stuffs.
you can hear almost everything from wall to wall
based on the "orange chicken" i ordered, i will never order from here again.
my order was flavorless, pork was dry and chewy like beef jerky.
it was all bad.
everything tastes like oil or soy sauce.
the delivery time was extremely fast, but other than that?
deli on rye no longer exists ---  do you understand this , yelp ?
deli on rye is gone !!!!!!
it is closed every day, all day!!!'  get it ?
there is never anyone here to help.
i guess crucial.com is going to get my $200.
wish i could say this was the first time this happened, but it's not.
and seems the top management don't care to fix the problem.
this place is a total shame for the car rental business and industry.
this place is a fraud n rip off do not be fooled.
i was eager to try this place since all the reviews are really good.
i arrived at the same time as a party of 8 did.
i left and will not return.
sadly this was not one of them.
i would not recommend.
we have now waited again thinking this was true.
no check as of jan 20th.
full story here:http://dasautodamages.weebly.com/about.html
this restaurant is a disgrace to mexican food.
it's like they want you to leave.
called them on november 20th because i locked myself out of my car.
i called within the hours posted on google.
no call back.
second time they have done this.
ordered 2 shrimp tacos, tasted terrible to say the least.
the sauce tasted unnatural and like it was made in a chemistry lab.
toilet had left-over urine in it because it didn't flush right.
didn't sleep a wink because of traffic noises and safety concerns.
worst place ever!!!
fungus was growing under all my  nails after i had them done here ..
i won't be returning here ..
our main entrees were very bland  and had very little portions.
also the oil for frying is very old and burnt .
i can see why this placed closed.
food was awful.
reminded my of a middle school cafeteria.
don't know how this place stayed in business for so long.
i will not return again!!!
my grandson who is 21/2 did not have a positive experience with this school.
my grandson had multiple injuries in the very short time he attended there.
i only write this for future parents to be aware of.
however, the quality of their food is really below average nothing surprising at all.
-one star because we received our belongings.
-ended up costing us about $1000 more than quoted.
-was not delivered in time frame given.
-best of all, the movers stole a watch i had on the counter.
-do not hire this company!!
apparently there's a new owner.
we knew something was different (not in a good way).
seriously should have paid the extra 30.00 to get an uber.
you want to know what's killing cab companies?
it's not lyft or uber, it's their own shitty operation.
formerly cadillac ranch, and not much has changed.
brisket pizza was satisfactory but thick sliced fresh jalapenos were a bit too much.
mahi mahi was very good, but somewhat small.
wait staff was average, and it goes down hill from there.
then a 18% gratuity tacked on a party of 4 adults an 2 kids.
do yourself a favor and stay at the marriott or hampton inn !
plenty of employees not helping customers.
slow as f***.
she can definitely stop so i can get out of here.
please and thank you.
the absolute worst experience i have received at a gyno.
insipid food, bad service, naan was stale and sky high prices.
they had just 2 people waiting 8 tables.
decor was not upto the mark.
i bought perogies to take out from schnitzel hub.
they admitted to the mix up but that's about it.
i bought 3 orders of it that they messed up.
they haven't replaced them.
they have ignored my complaints and my complaint to the bbb.
they don't care about their customers.
stay away from this restaurant!!!
worst service in the cafe ever.
6 people later, i finally ask if she is going to seat us.
even the manager was no help.
they were not busy, just lazy and not able to multi task.
the best way to describe this place is "ghetto".
enough is enough.
this is at the eastern location.
i assume the others are just the same.
nearly every item we tried to order was unavailable.
what we did get was meh.
service was slow.
overly loud singer made conversation difficult.
they don't like use coupon won't we won't come again don't trust them.
so it wasn't that busy....
the only staff i saw was a bartender and no waitress nor hostess.
if they had zero stars i would of rated zero.
5/1/2027 6:30 pm.
what a disappointment.
yes i realize you had 2 staff members working.
yes i realize that both were helping customers...
you could have at least acknowledged that we were there , waiting, and waiting.
there are a lot of auto parts stores in the area.
we took our business elsewhere
the first clue was that we were the only ones in there for lunch.
13.50 and still hungry.
maybe this place is jumping at night.
yes, the finals are on but the bartender could not have been much ruder.
sat at bar with debris from previous customer for better part of 10 mins.
hard to ask for menu and drink.
big events should have the a team of staff....definitely not working tonight.
will not be returning.
what a scam this place is !
first of all it's 2 miles from the airport rental car place.
and when you get to the counter, finally!
they tell you you have to have two utility bills with you.
don't bother with ace.
if you like to live without water, this is the place for you!
unfortunately that's not disclosed by their leasing agents before you sign a lease.
i wish we would have!
i don't recommend this location.
but now i see 100% no people skills!
if there negative stars i will do it!
we've seen tso three or four times now.
this show was not the same.
seemed demonic rather than christmas-y.
tried them twice.
both times they refused to contact my insurance for prescriptions.
i've never received a specific card for prescriptions from my insurance company for prescriptions.
have also never had any challenges ever in having a pharmacy call to verify.
they refuse to apply your insurance if you do not have your card.
both times i asked them to check with someone.
at $50 a month for my prescription this adds up.
i will take my business elsewhere.
this company deserves 0 stars.
i am extremely dissatisfied with the customer service.
and wanted to charge me an additional $120 dollars for an extra 2 hours...
that was more than the cost to rent the car for 4 days!!!
the meat was fatty, low quality, and the most repulsive meat we've ever eaten.
service was poor and it was extremely over priced.
had the worst experience with safeway this week.
it's now 3:30 and i've heard nothing from anyone.
extremely rude employees who clearly don't care to be there.
the new remodel is extremely dull.
i worked at a dq for 6 years, making this experience especially disappointing.
i didn't get that vibe on the other side of the counter.
wouldn't recommend, unless you've got some strooong cravings...
just expect to leave with a pit in your stomach!
worst indian food ever.
when you write a bad review, they'll petition yelp to remove it.
so it's so bad here , i'm writing again.
the tandoori chicken is not authentic tandoori.
anyone can take red food coloring and put it on baked chicken!!!
all curries are prepared poorly....water and curry powder doesn't equal curry.
this place also has the nastiest restroom of a restaurant in scottsdale.
seriously, this place is the worst.
i could have done a better job, and i am not a hairdresser.
the waitress forgot almost everything.
very, very, very unorganized restaurant.
will not be back.
i went there yesterday evening and the place is okay.
we recently visited due to a word of mouth referral and online reviews.
i finished my food before my refill came.
our server promptly came back for payment.
if your home warranty refers you to them, request a different company.
would not return calls and quoted availability for three weeks out.
methinks not is right!!
the service here was completely subpar.
not friendly in any meaning of the word.
felt like i was being rushed to leave the entire time.
the one and only salad was mediocre, but drenched in dressing.
furthermore, most of us had to wait 15 min just to get a refill
it was absolutely awful what they did to us.
i looked up and there was no rain.
it rained for like 20 minutes a half an hour ago...
it didn't rain the rest of the night either.
ended up going to a steakhouse down the street and sitting on their patio.
he asked if they could print it for him and the manager said no.
i'll be calling the regional office tomorrow to lodge a complaint.
the saddest day of my life.
i hate to do this but it's necessary.
one bite & in the trash went the whole pie.
avoid if you are hungry or thirsty.
we left to eat elsewhere.
worst bar ever.
if you want to be discriminated against and have horrible service come here.
this is place fell flat on it's face after that.
on a saturday it wasn't full.
so if you're looking for a crazy club in vegas this is not it.
worst service ever!
ordered 2 enchiladas over the phone to pick up.
i asked her to refund it and charge me for what i ordered.
she rung it up again for the cost.
i ended up paying like 30 dollars for 9 dollars worth of food!!!!
then she was like give me back the food!!!
i live 5 minutes away and drive to miguel's.
better food better service.
so sorry to say but won't be back after waiting several weeks to try.
the service was horrible, had to ask someone when we could place our order.
i had the egg with bacon, cheese and onion.
the bacon was dry and burn't and the sandwich on a whole was cold.
we won't be back anytime soon.
i had a $10 coupon.
i agreed to a "high mileage" oil which was "on sale" for $41.95.
i said "so it's $5 more" and the guys says yes.
when i asked about it, the guy wanted to argue, and i just left.
it's only $7, but it's enough for me not to go back.
my husband and i went to this dealership this morning.
how this place has such good reviews is beyond me.
where to begin?
the hollandaise on the eggs benedict tasted more like chicken soup than hollandaise sauce.
and the place smells so bad.
obviously built sometime in the 70s, the owners opted for carpet.
i absolutely do not recommend peppermill.
this cancer seems to be very prevelant with the younger males.
this is not ok and needs to be dealt with...
won't be going back.
big menu, bigger prices for sub par food.
total price on a meal for me and my daughter at 22.00.
way over priced and the food frankly wasn't very good.
the oriental girl that works here is super rude.
they treat you like a 3rd rate citizen.
it's obnoxious that they can charge $5,000 for a damn purse.
i am literally sitting in the parking lot writing this.
i'll take my business elsewhere from now on.
if i could select a minus star rating, i would.
they apologize profusely but nothing ever gets resolved.
horrible customer service!!!
avoid on track at all costs if you want the package to be delivered!
do your self a favor and use ups or fedex!
for the second time the product had to be re-shipped using a different carrier!
extremely disappointed and frustrated.
if you do go to this branch, make sure you...
scratch that, don't go to this branch.
don't do it!!!!
you are routed to a call center in india 2.
the daily rental fee triples plus you get a change fee added too!!
i will never ever rent from you again
this is the slowest serving panda express i have ever been to.
complete and total scammers.
liars, scammers and complete fraudster.
reported to the state insurance board.
rented a total of 6 tuxes for a wedding.
unbelievably bad experience.
won't everuse again.
to start, i love cpk.
not so much.
i am extremely disappointed at this location and the service here.
to sum it all up, do not waste your time going here.
go elsewhere at the biltmore (cheesecake factory, etc), this location is absolutely dreadful.
i ordered chicken mild and was given spicy instead.
so i had to drive back from home to get my order changed.
or one moment please".
i said i just ordered a medium french fries, she said...
oh you did order that, i said forget it and drove off.
what a scumbag policy of best buy!
called to ask about the location.
the beef patties were flavorless and hard.
the fries were dry and lacked seasoning.
overall i was not impressed with the food.
ive had better burgers from the frozen aisle.
i don't think ill return to this restaurant.
fyi the meal does not include a drink.
went for food, not drinks.
food was fine.
service was thoughtless.
also, they may want to check their plumbing or get some sort of filter.
their tap water had a horrible smell and taste.
i am in the do not call list for ages.
but this company still called me out of the blue.
i understand that they are trying to get their name known.
but the "do not call" list is there for a purpose.
they should not call people who are in the do not call list.
so no sale and so many puppies at these ridiculous prices.....
it should be more like finding them a good home ....
i was so disappointed with this establishment.
song and dance on the phone then bait and switch when you got there.
most of his machines were broken.
very seedy and undesirable place.
went to west flamingo fold and fluff instead.
they were gems!!
horrible customer service!!
i drove almost 45 mins to get there.
do not shop here!!!
we had the worst experience at this location .
will never go there again.
the staff is friendly but the doctors are ridiculously cautious.
if you need meds for a cough or cold, this is your place.
parents - this is not the place to take your kids.
we ordered cauliflower manchurian.
the cauliflower florets were rotten.
didn't want to argue.
made our stomach upset the very night.
i should've known better when my to go order came out within 2 minutes.
dry, old noodles.
superior pho has no competition.
no not them like i said they just don't care about animals
get your shit together!
the flavor was pretty bland and excruciatingly dry.
the sushi tasted off.
the one good thing is the dessert counter.
mini doughnuts had me at hello.
i would suggest going somewhere else, which i did.
would give 0 stars if allowed.
be careful when dealing with arizona collision specialists off raintree.
stay away from here unless you want to get tricked and taken advantage of.
i can't believe how bad of service we received.
i just think we were completely forgotten about.
there are other places to spend your money at folks.
it was my birthday for f****'s sake!
horrible service - rude as if we were suppose to be serving her instead.
food was less than desirable with exception of chicken fried chicken.
hostess - only friendly person.
would not recommend
warning: this is not korean food.
this place should be called china grill house.
not the most cleanest place.
similar to other bad experiences.
didn't feel welcome in the store.
can find what we need at plenty of other places in any event.
what is going on at this location?
huge disappointment visiting canter's.
bagel was served with the tiniest amount of cream cheese on the side.
won't be visiting again.
creative paradise was contracted to landscape my back yard in 2010.
for 13k in a down economy i would have expected perfection.
my flagstone looks horrible, with cracks and separation from the concrete.
i had complained and had them out several times.
what a scam.
why don't i want to buy a toyota?
hope this promotion helps your yelp score!
if i could give this place no stars i would!
she seemed to get upset when i asked for the lottery tickets.
they were not busy and there was no one in line behind me.
she acted as though it was a burden for her to print the tickets.
completely terrible steak was inedible.
service was not much better.
would not recommend!!
shame on  bonfyre!!!!
second try is still a tasteless trip to food hell!
should of found a sizzler.
table is dirty !!
do not recommendxoxoxo
was harassed by cashiers on the way to check out.
total wine is for the total white.!!!
thank you marissa and mathew for your excellent customer service.
i purchased from this show room the last 15-20 years.
i have been trying for over a week.
went into this showroom to ask for assistance.
he made no effort to call, offer advice, or anything!
he only handed me a phone number and sent me on my way.
do not go here!!
food takes forever and there was only 4 other people in the restaurant!
food isn't even good
worst management and customer service i have ever experienced!
rude employees, rude management.
went through our home warranty for a washing machine repair.
was promised twice for a 1st appointment of the day.
they do not care about customer service.
unless you are retired and can stay home all day waiting.
use someone else.
i am not being paid to do this.
i just dropped all the items and left.
will give my business to a company that offer customer service!
i will never shop at ct ever again.
highly reccomended is ragga beauty supply.
i'll never return to this place again!!!
i do not know how this mall is keeping the doors open.
every time i go there is another retailer who has left.
overpriced and overhyped.
there are much better places for the money, both food and service wise.
the bill showed otherwise.
my husband went here tonight to pick up dinner.
what could be so hard...
and people want $15 minimum wage.
first of all my delivery driver was rude.
my onion rings came cold and mushy.
my pizza was also burnt.
never ordering pizza from here again.
what a waste of $40 bucks.
we had reservations for noon for a large group of 13.
they were not ready table want set up.
service was slow despite them not being that busy.
our drinks sat empty.
our food didn't come out till after 1.
i got the grilled fish tacos and they were dry.
it was a lunch we needed to get back to work.
i would not go back.
very rude and acts like she hates her job.
she forgets the meds she has you on.
i was on a certain medication prescribed by dr.
worst psychiatrist ever with the worst attitude ever and she makes you feel uncomfortable.
run far away from this "doctor."
i was told it would take 15 minutes but it took closer to 40.
the food was good but not worth the wait or the price.
i used to love this store.
i think the prices are fair and the merchandise is stylish and well made.
the service however continues to decline.
associates don't greet customers with polite greetings.
the food was really good!
that's what i'd be saying if landrey did her job!
checked in with landrey she said the tables were first come first serve.
then landrey decided to give our table to someone who just walked in.
it's a shame i've herd such good things about this place..
update: john (owner) reached out and was very nice and helpful.
i will definitely give it a second go next time i'm in town!
i've only been once.
perhaps there is something good on the menu that i don't know about.
if you know of one, please share.
i had the "pho," which was not pho.
eat at your own peril.
then go to #1 pho downtown to "fix" it.
i own a tacoma already and am not impressed with the suspension.
the engine is great.
anyway, i know about suspension, i know about 4 wheel drive.
perhaps it is because i am a woman, he suggests i am not informed.
he walked with me back to my truck still arguing with me.
you lost a sale.
also shared this story with my friends and sister.
i will never use them again...
terrible customer service.
i won't waste my time or money at this business again.
we also wanted a quote on what it would be to install it.
our business is, at most 1/2 a mile from your location.
we have heard nothing.
we might not be a big business but our time is important also.
hot food is not hot.
thank you, coulter nissan, for wasting my time.
stay away from this place at all costs!
the employees were nice and helpful, and the pizza looked decent.
i wish i had read some of the yelp reviews before we stopped in.
eat here at your own risk!
then they wouldn't even refund my fee for "expediting" them.
their are hundreds of cleaners/alteration shops in las vegas.
i would steer clear of this one by any means.
poor customer service and technicians unskilled, could not repair appliance, stay away
just left this pos restaurant feeling disgusted and disgusting.
long story short, found steel wool in my food.
yeah so the food sucks!
it's like they offer so many options, american, italian, seafood but nothing is good!
yeah cause that really goes together?!
i'm having a horrible experience just trying to make my reservation!!!!
the wedding i am attending has a wedding block at this hotel.
i am glad that i read the reviews before taking my grandson here.
i don't like the fact that staff could not explain the injuries to kids.
i won't even ask for a tour.
i will pass.
thanks for the reviews.
if i can give 0 star here ill do it..
when i got the email receipt, theres a $13.00 late fee charge..
the car that i got for a rent was a nissan versa, all manual!
from windows to mirrors were sooooo basic..
just had my haircut from briana.
it was horrible.
she did the haircut in 15 min.
the fade and side burns were uneven.
i will never go back.
i will now be moving forward with small claims court.
please see for yourself at the following link:https://lasvegas-www.ebindr.com/complaint/download/90146557/c/p2j86c?bid=81303
i visited this location today and the customer service there was horrible.
no greeting or anything.
this was the worse experience ever!!
if i could rate this zero stars i would.
85 degrees outside...windows open...mosquitos everywhere.
actually went to walgreens to buy bug spray during the meal.
menu is extremely limited.
2 burgers, chicken salmon, 4 small plates....
too many other choices too close to ever come back here.
i would give this place 0 if i could.
but i'd rather walk to dovercourt and hallam instead.
i was a regular customer.
so regular that this was my second visit today.
then the manager tried to cheat me by overcharging me  50 cents.
not a mistake on his part, it was on purpose.
like said, i was a regular customer.
i am still speechless.
we wanted to sit outside because it was so nice out.
not a soul to be seen besides customers at a few tables.
we came in at 8:43 they not seating anymore.
the old lady server say we close at 9:30.
yes i know that but its 8:43????
never come here again!
very strange, and maybe i am just not going at the right time.
the fries were overdone today, which is a big mcd's no-no.
i always have my dogs with me, so going inside isn't an option.
went to buy a charger for my ipad.
i was asked if i needed help, said yes.
when i saw him again he said he had called someone to help me.
nobody ever showed while he decided to go talk to his buddy.
should not be named "sweet" at all!
very rude employees.
will never go here again.
word of mouth is bigger than this company may think.
pick another nail salon, unless you want to be treated badly!!
they don't even deserve one star.
service was good, food was horrible.
nothing had flavor, food was cold, tasteless and gross.
would not recommend it
cashier george that sold me a console was extremely rude.
this guy was equally rude over the phone.
what the hell is wrong with this guy?
does he not want business?
buyers stay away
don't go here if your if your a fellow introvert.
they'll have you in something you don't want in a heartbeat.
also, seems to be no connection to the store and their website.
website announces all these sales, go into the store, nothing.
it took them 20 minutes to get me my "hot-n-ready" lunch special.
i was on a strict time frame and needed lunch quick.
showed up for appointment where  they photocopied my insurance card paid my copay etc.
2 weeks later received a bill and was told the don't take my insurance.
if you go here call your insurance 1st.
i also ordered al pastor fries, which were super greasy.
the meat looked burnt and tasted super dry.
it definitely wasn't just cut off of the rotisserie.
i was there during the correct hours but okay...
why promote your specials if you aren't going to honor them?
in the future, i'll just make the drive to tacos el gordo.
they should really have a sign that warns people that they are sold out.
their eta is no where close to when they actually arrive.
very unhappy and probably won't order from here again
delivery was supposed to be at 730 and now it's 805 and nothing
whoever answered the phone at 1953hours today, november 6,2015..
shame on you!
would have probably given a half star if it was possible.
got the package with the "breakfast" included and it was sub par at best.
would not attend this conference again!
did come quickly but we paid dearly.
very over priced for amount and kind of work.
would only call if could not find another plumber.
some big girl.
i come here all the time but this was a 1st...
i've had a spanish lady before she was nice & good service...
went here last week and got terrible service.
there was only one waiter and they were terribly rude.
waiters forgot about us and a few other tables a couple times.
absolute nightmare, definitely will never be going back.
much better places to eat chinese food in montreal.
but home depo refers me to the installers.
they suck all the way around.
the customer service suck the employees r rude.
the manager is worse than her employees.
plus the cashiers doesn't know money...
they need to be shut down...
franchise chevron not a good one.
the owner makes special sandwiches and post them on yelp as the real deal.
the pictures on the yelp are an absolute lie.
i hate being deceived by business owners.
i've added a photo of the real product they serve.
we were good customers but will never return to this place again!
they need to fix their attitudes and learn how to provide good customer service!
okay so this place sucks so bad!!!
do not eat the wings!
i repeat do not eat the wings!!!
this place has not cleaned the oil in a very very long time.
and you can taste it.
my order took almost a full hour and i i've a mile while!
overall fuck this place.
don't waste your time or your money on this place.
they don't fix anything in a timely matter.
never follow thru on complaints.
i wouldn't recommend them to anyone
i personally wouldn't recommend this.
i thought it was really overpriced and didnt think the food was that good.
i had a sushi roll and it was just mediocre and cost around 30.00.
then they showed me that there was something lodged in my tire.
it turned out the thing lodged in my tire was a drill bit.
in the end we left.
to say that a stroller would be in the way is just ridiculous.
we will most likely not return.
the food is bland and tasteless and overpriced.
$6 for a mediocre latte?
the market carries a random assortment of useless iyems.
i hope it closes and a better restaurant takes the good location.
this review is for the service department only.
do not come here!!!
i repeat, do not come here.
the rooms are disgusting!!!
the outside is very deceiving the rooms are totally different.
i don't think he used a new blade to shave me.
not happy for first time customer.
disappointed, won't be going back.
this place is gross!
the food was so bad.
the service mediocre.
i only took small bites of everything and i spit it right out.
i will never go back to this place.
went to this location a few weeks ago and ordered a strawberry sundae.
we were told they were out of strawberries so we asked for cherry.
they were out of cherries too.
we turned around and walked out empty handed.
worse doctor visit ever.
the receptionist mixed up my daughter's chart with someone else's.
like i sed worse doctor office ever!
i dont even have a big sweet tooth to begin with!
i would give 0 star if there was such a choice.
and i asked for 8 candles because it's for my dad's 70th birthday.
i found out they gave me only 5 candles when i got home!
the worst service i have ever experienced!!!
"hey man what's the crowd like inside?...
20 year olds 35 year olds" definitely not.
not the place for a night out if you're over 25
horrible and disappointed!
i still have to point out the missed spots at fenders and trunk..
it seems like nothing has done to my car even the vacuuming.
it was a waste of money but i  still gave tip..
for the effort.
the woman was incredibly rude and short with me.
worst urgent care ever.
was told and given paperwork by them for my high blood pressure.
waiting over a month for my results and still nothing.
these people are idiots!
horrible service do not go here!!!
we should have been notified and rescheduled.
of the wrought iron.
she said she had our number and would have an estimator call.
well, it has been two days and we haven't heard from the establishment.
stay away unless you wanna spend all night long in line.
he called us profane racist names as we were driving away.
not worth the hassle!
way better staff and service!
is it vegan?
i could have went to wendys for that nonsense.
this place will go out of business quick-
this place is horrible.
my hotdogs were basically raw as well as the bacon.
never again will i eat from dump again!!!
first and last time trying this pizza.
so much sauce on one pizza but very little cheese.
edges of crust burnt and inedible but the rest of the crust was underdone.
i wish i would have seen these reviews before signing the lease.
the restaurant is very dirty so i definitely would never eat in there.
i've gotten carry out and delivery a few times though.
the pizza is very greasy and tastes like the cardboard box it's served in.
also, the people working there are pretty dirty as well as sketchy looking.
i haven't been here in awhile because the pizza is garbage.
this was my neighborhood vet for my rescue dog.
instead, my dog died on their operating table.
bottom line: skip this vet.
the ladies who work up front were very courteous and helpful.
however we went to purchase a trailer hitch and have it installed.
my car is still there and won't start.
i hope they pay for the damages to my car.
little to no communication with service writer, who exhibited condescending attitude.
what a jerk !!
horrible place !
absolutely the worst service, not the first time.
never had this issue at any other zara...
who can you inform about this.
went to this spot on a recommendation....bad move!
the girls look okay, but they sit around a lot.
we ordered 3 drinks and were charged $50!
and it wasn't even top shelf liquor....never again.
save your time and your money.
went for breakfast because it was included in our stay.
the food was cold.
they never came over to offer us the "free" mimosas.
we used homejoy around 7 times.
the first 2 cleanings were amazing, and then the cleaner we had was moved.
the following 5 had 2 no shows, and 1 good clean.
would not recommend an organization like this that does not care about its customers.
worse experience ever!
they ruined our wedding day.
even worse, the owner claimed no responsibility and charged us the full amount anyways.
we've been fighting with the credit card company for months.
the owner stopped returning my calls and emails.
great ambiance however completely disorganized.
our only option was to wait for lounge area to free up.
this kind of disregard for patrons secures that i will never return.
worst waste of time ever.
never renting for you again.
ay yi yi!
i hate leaving bad reviews but sadly, this one is deserved.
very bad customer service!
bad bad bad!
today two out of my two drinks were wrong!
ugh, am i going to go back to fix them?
no cause it took 30 mins.
for the first order!
i'm not demanding either.
hire more help please!
obviously they are too overwhelmed!
had to find an atm to get cash!
in the end they complained about not enough tips.
the worst example of indian food, ever.
we ordered the chicken tikka masala (their specialty), aloo gobi, and tandoori chicken.
the tandoori chicken was flavorless and the meat hard, the accompanying onions soggy.
in short, a disastrous experience and a traversety of indian food.
poor food with below average service!
what could be better?
oh my goodness!
this place has the worst service of any place i have ever been.
they ignore you.
and it is a very small place.
there were only five people in the whole interior of the building.
yet we left him a nice tip.
i'm not sure why?
one of the worst dining experiences ever.
they screwed up our salads (yes ...
i ask for the manager ...
what a waste of time and money!
reserved an item online and got confirmation email that it was here.
well, their inventory was "incorrect" apparently.
this place is mad.
purchased a groupon for an oil change.
they were rude on the phone.
that's fine, i've purchased several groupons for oil changes and that's normal.
took extra time because they were looking for the wrong thing.
it ended up being an extra $60 with them replacing my brake light bulbs.
would not return.
and of course we are aware that it is not free of charge.
it's been a month for us, and we just realized it.
since i ate it, we're even vegas.
we ordered 2 breakfast sandwiches at 3am.
i call at 3:50am to ask what the status was.
forget it i will never order from there ever again.
this company is a straight up scam.
this company is no good!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
ordered the eggs benedict.
they must have lost it all in the poaching process.
awful customer service.
they were so rude i had to walk out.
didn't seem very interested in serving me at all.
i felt like i was bothering them.
never come back again !
have had two not so great experiences here.
they refused to give me a refund on the blood test.
not great business practices and they didn't even seem to care about it!
this place is losing it..
always understaffed can only wash outside better off going to the one on russell
i used to enjoy coming to this location.
i think they must have changed management.
i only visit about once every 2-3 months for staff meeting food.
the energy is low with the employees.
the manager has an apparent  sour attitude.
it was very unprofessional.
the other employee was not happy to be there herself.
horrible employee dharma added dairy into my nieces all fruit smoothie (strawberry whirl).
my niece is very allergic to dairy.
when asked if she did she denied it.
dharma was not even sincerely sorry at all when confronted.
do not come to this location.
30+ min to get a water is ridiculous.
and there was only like 10 people in front of me.
on of the worst places i have ever been!
if you don't get a confirmation e-mail then your appointment was never made.
why would they make that an option on their site?
car showed up 10 after and i was out.
don't waste your time
it's a beater, so i'm not looking to put much $ into it.
it's company policy is all he would tell my why.
wtf kind of service it that?
i grabbed my keys back and just left.
what a bunch of morons.
i've never done this before and usually brush off any bad experiences i have.
sorry to you loyal customers but i will never go back:(
worst dunkin' donuts ever.
never coming back.
the buying experience is great.
very kind, helpful, and fast!
but i would not work here.
the staff is actually great!
this store's weakness is the manager charles.
this place needs to close.
i ordered a taco salad with chili.
when he gave me the bag i saw no chili.
he said it was in a cup under the top level.
additionally the black beans were nothing but paste.
furthermore, they never answer the phone number provided by google search.
you are worthless.
do us a favor and close.
yea for the local franchise but boo for the brand!!!
this place is by far the worst!
they make sure to collect your copayment before hand.
unbelievably the worst customer service.
i will never come here again...
do not deal with these people!
tim took my $1000 for an advance on a big buck hunter game.
super slow service.
bathroom soap leaves your hands smelling like a urinal cake.
baked outside in the sun with no umbrella.
this is the most horrible place.
the rude manager chris or something is a bastard.
he compares this place to disney land.
while this place lacks basic amenities.
please do not visit this place.
all can say is.....
$16.75 for a bowl of chicken pho and it's full of msg.
crazy price mark up!!!!
terrible customer service.
grumpy wait staff.
totally ruined our experience but the food was mediocre anyways.
the only redeeming quality is the patio.
hit the rectory instead.
this gym is terrible and some of the staff members are very unprofessional.
i would not recommend this gym to anyone
it was the worse experience i had at a nail shop.
i took my kids here and the service was extremely poor.
we finally had to just go to another restaurant!
never a consistent price.
never going back.
the food was not edible and service mediocre.
lastly they do not serve everything they say per entree.
no good save your cash!!!!
this location has 4+ signs advertising "breakfast all day!".
is this a case of false advertising that i smell?
or is it just a problem with an as*hole employee again?
terrible terrible service.
will never buy there or recommend them.
i would give 0 stars but that's not an option
she did this while i was shopping so everyone in the store could hear.
i wish someone would complain about her to upper management.
this place now closed.
no longer doing business.
make sure you trade-in your restaurant.com vouchers.
horrible!!!!!ordered a chicken ceasar on my lunch....
do not try!!!!!
save yourself a trip there do not buy!!!!!
do not go here.
ordered take out, took 30 min.
place was empty.
all the staff on their cell phones.
the quesadillas were the same.
did you leave your cooks and wait staff at the old location.
this was really bad food and service.
price is outrageous.
ordered at the counter, $11.50 for basic deli turkey on 2 slices of rye???
very small and taste was average at best.
never will return.
the food is terrible.
it is either canned or stale, absolutely somewhere i would not go while hungry.
do yourself a favor and don't waste your money.
i came here with my friend & service was poor.
usually they pour it into a cup each.
the food is mediocre, i don't think it's worth it.
i would recommend going to national instead just down the street.
just spent $15 on drinks then asked for a water as well.
was told each glass of water was $1.
can you say absurd rip off.
the price for up front seats was absurd at 700.
and 14.00 for a beer ?
do not recommend, and do not plan on returning.
kept waiting, she offered to take our drinks but not our order.
the whole experience was slow.
we ended up having to take our food to go because of the time.
complete rip off.
got couple bits and pieces of lobster like a dog chewed on it.
jumbo shrimps were just regular sized shrimp.
the server was great tho but doesn't make up for the bad food.
place has shutdown.
went today for my normal monthly haircut and place is dark.
wish i could give no stars!!!!
i can hear them airing the entire vehicle next to me's bank business.
i've never had an issue with any other bank branch.
i'll gladly drive further from my house for shorter lines and better customer service.
this dentist is way too busy working on too many patients at one time.
the assistant that "fitted" the crowns was not competent and took forever making adjustments.
the dentist seemed bored with the whole procedure.
no.go to laura secord.
go o purdy's.
cheaper and smaller line.
just not worth it at all...
it was so plain.
i would definitely just pass...
walmart quality food.
all fish was over cooked, dry and tasteless.
prime rib was chewy like rubber.
sushi, i had better sushi at walmart.
fried rice was dry, and sushi rice was not cooked properly.
overall it's the worst buffet i've ever been to.
worse experience last night.
moments later, same thing happened to me.
they never told us why we were detained, despite us asking continuously.
unfortunate, we loved encore beach club but after this, we will never return.
this is simply not ok.
kick us out if we did something wrong, that's fine.
first impressions usually make or break a hotel experience for me.
the front desk folks were polite and there were no issues with check-in.
i won't be back to this hilton property.
while the food is good, it isn't worth the consistently bad service.
they didn't seem apologetic, only annoyed that i interrupted their conversation.
if i could give this place zero stars, i would.
nothing but bad customer service and bad attitude.
if you don't want to do nails for a living, then don't.
save your time and money.
this place has gone down hill.
stale tortillas and the same size as a 99 burrito at taco bell.
so disappointed i stopped here
i'm sorry buy i have to go with one star for this place.
after reading some good reviews we decided to go there on a tuesday night.
the green tea came 10 min after we sat down  .
we ordered and got our rolls but no wasabi or ginger.
the food was not good.
but as someone who loves sushi i couldn't have it.
overall i'm sorry but not worth the discount or the time .
sad but true.
i received a discount card through one of the owners which was 10% off.
what is the point for this discount card???
spent 40min looking for a bank and driving through traffic.
if you receive a discount card just throw it in the garbage!
horrible communication with very little understanding of customer service.
will be going to different place from now on.
this place is terrible.
dirty, unsanitary place with rude people who half ass do their jobs.
he has fallen out of his bed easily at least 15 times a week.
this place is done.
a $3 minimum charge is not the same as a $3 additional fee.
avoid and do not give them your money!
who knew that they no longer refund your money???
i knew this about sales items but really???
that is the last $40.99 this shitty store will ever get from me.
really annoying to see this kind of behavior.
he didn't even give me a tour of the second floor.
they are all behind the counter in the same spot.
i received a coupon email to use at only this location.
the coupon email said no where that it had to be printed.
we ended up paying the full price and walked out extremely angry.
will never go back!
if i could give this store zero stars i would!
horrible customer service and very unprofessional!
never going here ever again!
stay far far away from this business!
i called b.o.b ahead of this cancellation date and told i needed to cancel.
the owner of b.o.b. would not refund me.
only after i filed a dispute did b.o.b. refund me.
this company is sketchy and is only looking to make a buck,
eh, experience wasn't great.
my son had gotten a cereal killer donut and it was basically just dough.
don't think i'll be returning anytime soon or at all.
was initially told that the keg was being changed.
fine, i'll wait it's 104 outside and i want a cold beer.
it's 6:15pm on a saturday evening.
bartender asked if i wanted a coors light instead.
i said no, if i wanted a coors light, i'd have asked for one.
oh well, taking my patronage elsewhere.
this place is awful!
they purposefully decieve, lie and charge you for what you did not agree to.
it is shameless.
he never returns a phone call.
or an email.
otherwise i hate them.
now they are blocking emails from senders that i have not blocked.
i wish there was a different provider in my area.
never going back again!!
the lady was rough with my cuticles.
smh eff this place!!
we will take our bi-weekly business elsewhere.
50 minute wait to get a car.
24 people in line when i got there.
then, the car smelled like bo.
no one pick up phone call on a bussiness day hours...
way to go for the most expensive internet services i have ever paid ..
the only available service if you live in innova
no quiet, so there can be no enjoyment.
lots of kids running around at all hours.
otherwise, this place has management problems.
i had the fish taco for lunch and it is totally tasteless.
where in mexico do they eat fish tacos with thousand island dressing?
went for valentine's day dinner and totally disappointed.
we ordered steak tacos for appetizer, steak sandwich and steak salad.
the steak on all three items was cold!
it's like it had been sitting out for an hour before they served it.
flavors were bland and un-exciting.
we could have easily made all three items at home for a weekday dinner.
don't order the shepherd's pie if your hungry..
it's as small as a soup and it over 15$...
came starving and left hungry....
not impressed or coming back.
worst service ever!
do yourself a favor and never use that service!!
first of all not sake bar !!!
sashimi combo that i ordered, more than 50% was cheap salmon.
should try "gonoe" then you could review thia restaurant.
i eat sushi or sashim atleast once a week.
i do not consider roll as a sushi..
big rolls (lots of rice and cheap salomon) are their specialty !!
i don't go back.
north york area has better qualify sushi and sashimi.
she will not give you a straight answer for price.
she is a con artist.
she will keep on calling you honey and honey that with broken english.
she will also try to use her broken english to cheat you with price.
what a shame because frank was very good.
find a different place to work for frank.
went for lunch.
first refill on beverage, the waiter put the glass on a dirty plate.
proceeded to slide it across the table.
dine at your own risk.
management was not willing to do more than " i will talk to him."
have a good day and drive safe
could they have not just told me that the first place?
this place really fell apart since the new ownership.
the young girls talking about weed.
the only person doing his job good was the young male.
when i've eaten here in the past, food was good as was service.
peaches not ripe.
crunch when you chew them.
fresh peach pies require soft, ripe peaches.
how about just a double crust or lattice crust baked peach pies?
forget the dutch crumble--always too sweet.
so i just decide to take them.
i tried them on and they were a bit small around my hips.
so the next day i went in to exchange.
mine were a medium.
never in my life have a been so pissed off with someone.
we dined at stone and vine tonight with a family of 7.
we really wanted to love this place because it is so close to us.
the bruschetta was really good.
add to that i realized their car wash machine pulled my passenger mirror off!
the staff is far from customer friendly and they obviously don't care.
pros: some funcons:-horrible rental guns unless you spend $$$-crazy paint prices!
10$+tax for a 100 balls?
u r kidding!?
you can pick up a box/2000 for 30+tax at any paintball store!
-kids working as refs/immature/don't care about anything.
went here for the breakfast buffet, would definitely take a pass next time.
scrambled eggs were terrible and not much of a selection of anything.
sausage was all burnt.
the fruit that was there was in a small bowl.
the buffet just wasn't good.
and the service there was very poor and slow.
it's a decent size city, find another breakfast nook!
she got an oil change as well.
the manager, john, rolled his eyes at her when assisting.
we feel he did this because my wife was a woman.
we wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.
b&n better wake up & price match.
owners sister run`s the place now and its terrible.
the food has no flavor to it now.
i went back 3 times thinking they had a bad night.
i was wrong.
the food is just nasty.
ive tried to tell her and she thinks your a idiot and is rude.
at one time this place was great but no more!
this is probably the most unprofessional experience i have ever encountered.
i am still battling to receive a refund since mother's day.
worst service that i have ever received.
please do not fall into their trap.
went in to buy just a tube.
talked with the man behind the counter and was impressed.
i told him i would be in contact.
e-mail response was a complete bait-and-switch.
i have limited time and patience for this "used car salesman" type of approach.
my business most certainly will go elsewhere.
nothing special here, just another run of the mill slimy bike dealer.
i don't recommend this place at all!
this is her oldest daughter writing this review.
they suck honestly.
they left streak marks on all our nails.
i have to say they did good for our pedicures but not manicures..
spending hours on the phone every month b/c they cant figure it out......
stay away from the sprint unless you have free time ......
hi, i went to bulk barn today and waited in line to pay.
when it was my turn, i was not acknowledged by the cashier.
i was taken aback as this was extremely rude.
she then muttered the amount that i had to pay.
i gave her the money.
as a paying customer we deserve to be treated better!
i stomped it and lost my appetite.
wish i had read the reviews first.
beware of prepaying services on groupon and trying to get an appointment.
kristin the owner doesn't take appointments by phone.
she did not respond to an email about this or return another followup call.
i asked groupon for a refund.
it totally killed her bday.
he apologized to the man behind me like i was the problem.
i will never shop at napa after this experience.
corporate office's employees are not helpful to resolve my issue.
will let you know if any outcome in 60 days!
we are not happy at this moment!
this has to be the worst shipping service in history.
this is through amazon when using their prime service.
maybe there is just a single truck or something?
or maybe this is a bike messenger service?
whatever it is, they definitely do not have the customer in mind.
the next day, the same thing.
"out for delivery"
bad experience with this one.
mother's day present gone wrong.
at 4:08pm i submitted my mobile order.
i walked into the store a minute or two later.
there were 3-4 people in line already.
i take a seat and listen to every persons order come out wrong.
at 4:37, a manager told me to call 1-800-tacobell.
i called and they said i'll get my money back in 3 business days.
the people who were there are rude.
the food is okay but way overpriced.
after giving them a second chance, never going back.
what is up with that??
not cool, wash your stuff more often!!!
have had a good experience at other locations but this place need improved service.
other places with better service in my opinion.
the cucumbers had been frozen.
all that for $12.00 including a small water.
he never responded.
this place does bad work and provides bad customer service.
don't go there.
don't ever go here they are slow and don't care about the patrons.
she just ignored me and walked away when i voiced my concerns.
i let another worker know my frustrations and he offered to fix it.
he tried but i came home and it wiped right off 2 hours later.
worst $30 ever spent!
what does this mean anyways?
i'm very sad as i loved that guys pizza when they opened!!
this place just got fined for mice and vermin.
horrible service and food as well.
massage was amazing.....
i will not recommend this place.
i've been with them for 5 months for auto insurance in nj.
nothing has changed on my end.
worst experience in a while !
walked in to employees arguing amongst themselves and ignoring the guests at the register.
no manager seen or perhaps she was part of the motley crew!
the one at the airport is just ...
and the food was very average
this place has really gone downhill compared to a few years ago.
the food taste horrible and burnt.
i would not recommend anyone to eat here.
i rather go to coco for bubble tea instead
better to sell everything than it was to deal with daniels moving!!!!
contact on their part is focused mainly on payment, not on follow through.
staff lied to me, i felt cheated of my time, and service was poor.
last weekend we rent a car from advantage on gilepsie.
paper work said toyota had 30k millage,but it was more than 130k.
he had no respond.
what's the point to even asked?
stay away from advantage rant a car.....
keep loosing customers
fifteen minutes before we finally got our food.
that wasn't the problem.
came here for the first time.
still had an hour and a half before they closed.
while waiting for this ride decided to play some games.
they closed that part too!!!!
we bought $20 worth of tickets and basically only use $5 worth.
they need to tell people before they buy them!!!!
i don't know if we would come back.
i hate this place.
i came back and she said it would be another hour.
now i go somewhere else and refuse to even get gas from this place.
very rude girls behind the counter
had kosher guest staying over and ordered from this place.
tried 2 different types of pizza.
they must use a special type of sauce and cheese.
something that has no flavour!
wow so tasteless.
the tasteless pizza is topped off with shoddy service.
what a joke this dump is.
well-done, dry hamburgers.
the pepsi was awful - pretty sure it was not real pepsi.
will never eat here again.
just went here on 4/2/15 to see puddle of mudd.
paid $15 extra to have balcony access vip.
what a waste!
had to go downstairs in the 'cheap' seats just to see the show.
to top it off, they played  5 songs and walked off.
don't waste your time or money here.
i picked my suit up and tried it on and it fit wonderfully.
i was not doing anything strenuous whatsoever.
they did an appalling job at sewing them back together.
and they charged me about $90 to do it.
my suit was a $700 suit and now it is worthless.
if you want to have a quality job done do not come here.
the fish was reordered.
possibly the worst restaurant in america.
i did it twice, thinking that the first 90-minute wait was a fluke.
the 2nd time, it took 2 hours and 30 minutes.
and they're not going to discount your bill for this unexplained, extreme lateness.
but that doesn't even matter.
never ever ever again.
the only thing worse than their customer service is their lack of integrity.
it is not even worth trying to do business with these jokers.
i think they do want your money though.
i'll go to dana lou's from now on.
there's no bathroom, air conditioning or wifi.
good tater tots and that is it.
stopped in for a bite to eat before the pirates game.
i had a gyros and my son had cheeseburger sliders.
the meat was not very tasty and was definitely not quality beef.
unless you are just drinking...go somewhere else for food.
we walked in and it was completely empty; probably a ominous sign.
i ordered some sushi rolls.
food was completely bland and very disappointing.
total wine is for the total white.
racist staff and unsatisfactory customer service.
better off just going to wal-mart for better service.
my advice is to stay away from this place at all cost!
if you like north indian food, best to avoid this place altogether.
food is unnecessarily spicy.
avoid...bad indian food.
i wish i could give no stars.
they also routinely screw up my order.
very rude counter person.
will never go back to this location.
employees being yelled at by a manager.
i'm a big fan of kelly's.
love the food.
love the drinks.
any other time kelly's has a great menu, awesome cocktails and friendly bartenders.
but watch out for snatchy fridays.
bought a birthday present for mom on amazon.com, picked up by ontrac.
this has never happened before in the 15 years we've lived there.
today is friday.
ontrac: you guys are pathetic.
today i found out that as of yesterday this store is permanently closed.
i will try to make this story as short as possible.
i have never been to that salon.
which i was okay with since i was desperate.
spoke with steve in the morning to make an appointment for a consultation.
he said no problem and made an appointment to meet with me that afternoon.
guess what...he didn't bother to show up or call and cancel.
too bad because he was my frontrunner!!!!
we tried this place today for the first time and we were very disappointed.
the rolls were sloppy to say the least.
i would expect more for the average price being 13 dollars per roll.
we will not be returning and i would not recommend this place to anyone!
hit and run.
i had to replace it $115.
all summer filling out insurance forms and getting the run around.
not paid back.
rotten rotten rotten company.
i got protein cobb and this is what i get in my salad.
very fresh zupas very fresh brown salad..
others waiting in line had also expected to pay $34.99.
once and only once...never again huhot
this is seriously the most disgusting fried chicken i have ever eaten.
the only thing i could taste was grease.
the atmosphere is nice enough for this type of place.
they offer self serve drinks, but the root beer was not working.
won't ever buy anything from that sales person.
happen to be wearing my moving and cleaning grubbies.
they only carry new.
what a creep!
off to find my appliance elsewhere.
this doesn't even come close.
the chicken had no flavor whatsoever.
the customer service was great, but i would not go back.
all i can say about this place is so not worth the money.
our service was slow and it wasnt even full.
the food was cold and tasted old.
the best thing i had here was my drink and buffalo wings.
let's just say i will not be returning here.
just stay away.
employees just dont seem to care.
save your money and go somewhere else where the service isnt complete dog shit.
not sure why so many people gave this place more than 1 star.
staff was attentive but the xiao long bao were not good.
the restaurant did not offer a variety of meat dumplings.
i would have enjoyed the dumplings more if there was chicken dumplings.
try a different place if you crave xiao long bao.
we are not going back here.
this place is a dump.
stinky rooms, ripped carpet, cigarette holes in the comforters.
they always screw up my order.
i go here for convenience but man do i always regret it.
she didn't offer to help or say sorry.
i felt as if i was bothering her more than being a paying customer!
not impressed at all with this place.
the great reviews did not live up to the experience we had.
the pizza was just alright and a bit overpriced for what you get.
the bread (and dipping oil) was the best part of the meal!
overrated and underwhelming, unfortunately.
i spent some time pulling apart the chicken to remove the largely inedible parts.
it's not the most unappetizing fast-food experience i've had.
first time to eat here.
every chicken finger was stringy and fatty, a little undercooked.
onion rings were greasy and fell apart.
worst lunch i have eaten out in a long time.
my friend that i met there had made the suggestion to go there.
next time, i will make the suggestion to go elsewhere.
went in to grab some lunch after my haircut.
there was only a few people at a couple tables.
i stood there over 5 minutes waiting to be seated.
no one came over or said anything to me.
i ended up walking out.
i rather go to the one in gilbert.
they have better service.
these ladies need a lesson in sense of urgency.
start to finish it took me 20 minutes to order and receive my drink.
pick up the pace.
people have flights to catch.
however, i fixed the issue and tried to communicate that to them.
this is absolutely unacceptable!
definitely not professionals at all.
please save yourself the headache and look else where.
unbelievable how rude servers were to us.
we were blown off by couple servers.
waited there for 20 minutes, nobody even acknowledged us.
a server helped tables next to us couple of times and completely ignored us!
we picked up and left.
got great service at tap house-the complete opposite of sierra gold.
we are never coming back!!!
dr. damian is inconsiderate and unprofessional.
my first appointment i waited 4 hours to be seen.
the staff was not very pleasant either.
if you complain they make you feel like you did something wrong.
if i could i'd give no star i would.
i've been to 4 different original pancake house locations.
the other 3 are all an absolute treat.
this location sucks.
the food is ok.
the manager is a dishonest dealer.
the services was unfriendly to say the least.
not a fan- poor service, marginal food.
i left barely eating the dish.
not worth taking anything home.
low quality homes built by low quality trades.
their sales people are disrespectful and dishonest.
their design center is a ripoff.
beware of their "preferred" third party builders.
their warranty department is a joke.
it is really a mitigation department that tries to fight you over every repair.
then the repairs are just as low quality as the build.
they have really good prices but i absolutely hate going to walmart.
the quality of the item is always poor and they have terrible customer service.
and whenever you go to walmart it an all day event.
thankfully they put in a few self checkouts.
the food was cold and portions were small for the price.
i took 2 of my boys here for a daddy/son date.
it was hideous.
the mac and cheese looked old.
my corned beef hash looked like it was right out of the can.
the pancakes looked decent.
the water tasted horribe.
when i mentioned it they said it was because it was an old building.
it is mass produced food you can make at home cheaper and better.
i would suggest finding a better option.
good food, terrible terrible service.
will not return.
i do not know our waitresses name but she was rude.
if you want sloppy job and rudeness , this is your place.
oh and you better be on time - even though they are not ......
my beer was like warm actually my tacos were colder than my beer.
extremely disappointing experience - expensive and lousy job.
they are very quick but at the expense of doing even a decent job.
the on terror was left dusty and the windows smeared.
will not come back.
we order from here all the time.
but it has become the same thing over and over again.
delivering cold pizza is not a good idea.
hire more people if you're that busy and stop giving excuses.
kudos to the clerk.
absolutely will never book with them again!
we had a prepaid reservation for early pickup this morning.
so disappointing to have such a bad experience and customer service.
most likely my phone was stolen by one of the employees.
the manager actually said to me..
"you shouldn't lose your phone." we were the only two customers there.
worst experience with this moving company.
beyond livid with this service!
never ever again
the owners are so rude and the nail specialist are very unprofessional.
i will never come back here.
i would recommend luxury nails or creative nails, they are both nearby.
what a loser - he lost the business of a regular without any care.
no call, crickets.
this bakery shop can really kill people.
service is horrible too.
always so slow to get anything...doesn't matter if it's morning or night.
15 mins waits...only good is the location...
very disappointed in wait time and service.
25 minutes for two minimal waffles, tukey bacon and turkey sausage.
as we were short on time already, we requested it to go.
in addition, the turkey sausage was very pitiful and small.
heading to the other waffle cafe on durango right now.
the better one.
we were in town for a convention nearby.
the bartender was very inattentive and rude.
will not return.
(poor teens) are getting talked to like they're stupid but they're definitely not.
well, its off course overpriced cause it's in a hotel/casino in vegas.
the food it's ok, good flavor.
but i still don't understand why waitress here treat people like ish!
i get its vegas, drunk people all the time, crazy customers, etc.
but if we are in work clothes, with our badges and laptops.....
don't think i'll come back here.
lazy vet exam leads to poor quality care.
will not return.
the first time and only time i've experienced this food was as take out.
we both ordered vegetarian ramen.
the amount and salt and oil completely ruined the taste and flavor.
after a few bites, and then a few more, we threw them away.
not a packers bar!!!!
it's a panther's bar.
not one green bay packers anything on the wall just nothing.
go pack go, still trying to find a true packers home, the hunt continues.
do yourself a favor and go down to the location at whitehall commons.
do not go here!
i waited 25 minutes for a pedicure and they did a horrible job!!!
save your money!
go some place else.
they are rude, the massage on my pedicure lasted all of about 30 seconds.
the tools were not cleaned and she put no salts in my water.
nasty filet mignon.
(yes, she did adjust the bill when i asked.) the scrambled eggs were dry.
the avocado was brown.
the bacon was delicious.
decent enough food but horrible service!
no refills and we asked and then waited for our bill for 30 minutes!
another 45 minutes later and issue remain unresolved, no further than when we started.
this place used to have good pizza, such a shame.
nothing worse than soggy, greasy, limp pizza crust.
3 strikes, your out.
we asked for a refund and left!!
horrible customer service!
and ruined our plans for sure
breakfast was meadioker.
employees are very nice and try to compensate for the owners rudeness.
she should stay behind the scenes maybe bookkeeping!
their customer service pales by comparison!
i guess so.
which is a shame, as it was otherwise an okay place to tan.
after paying, they told me that it would be a 5-10 minute wait.
next time, i'll pay the extra $5 to go to papa john's.
do yourself a favor & avoid this club, they're fucking assholes.
and the inside area is shit.
biggest rip off of my life
the staff said that there was not an appointment available for 2 months.
she was absolutely horrible.
i had a horrible experience with this office.
incredibly, bad service.
too bad, used to like this place.
i wanted to try their another flavor but they would not honor their coupon.
what poor customer service.
pinching penny's just to loose a good customer.
rude and lame
there was nothing that i would consider good.
mcdonalds would be a better choice.
chocolate bars were stale.
won't be shopping here for sweets again.
staff is super rude.
absolutely no training in customer service.
same for the office staff.
we rarely wear shoes inside and have no pets.
they try to upsell you to condition or scotchguard.
the couple stains (very small) are still there.
don't bother with this company look elsewhere.
patrick and his assitant were nice that was the only positive of this experience.
just walked out of our favorite sushi place.
sat at our table for 10 minutes without service of any kind.
did not see usual manager or service staff there.
place looked very unorganized this evening and many people sitting without food.
not sure if i will return.
you can find a better place to live next to a dumpster.
this place sucks.
what can you say about bookmans?
for what it is, it isn't.
this establishment is nothing like the original.
the food of all our dishes have been lukewarm...precooked.
this location may damage the reputation of the providence location.
we will not be back but will take the drive.
worst delivery people in the business.
don't do business with these people!
worst customer service i have ever  seen.
i have sat for  30 plus minutes before i was greeted and served
absolutely repulsed by my service here and will never be back.
do not give them your business.
used to have great food and flavor.
i've eaten there since they've opened.
they don't follow the ingredients on their menu.
don't know if they're trying to cut costs or what.
time to look for another chinese take out...
worst possible experience ever.
can't find any kind of customer service throughout the store whatsoever.
great another 30 minutes of searching for another live body.
finally, we think we'll get help....and get told things in acronyms.
then he says" it's an acronym." no shit sherlock.
totally hate places that make hard working people feel like idiots.
guess this idiot will go spend my hard earned money elsewhere.
nasty food couldn't even finish it.
over battered shrimp and bland, tasteless and mushy fish.
the french fries weren't even good!
so disappointed because we love this type of food.
never going back.
whoever owns/runs this restaurant should fire themselves.
whatever coke rep is over servicing this restaurant should be fired as well.
shame on both of you.
replace the old nasty machine now.
gross gross gross.
the half is for the nice manager and clean dinner area only.
the buffet also had flies buzzing about it.
lost 2 of 3 pairs of jean's.
guy was very rude, will never do business again !
we were the only customers in the place.
probably because they have no customers.
so, the food just sits and sits.
my burrito was gross.
i couldn't eat it.
this bank as a whole sucks!
don't waste your time!
my advice is don't bank with bofa.
going to transfer my money and services to a different bank!
well the plumber showed up and "fixed" the problem by disconnecting my water softener.
i was wrong.
i will never do business with temprite a/c and plumbing again.
so glad they closed.
owners were not friendly at all!!!!
they don't need to be in business.
i come here all the time!
our spare ribs were not cooked!
i wouldn't come here.
my advice is to just get mcdonald's
just opened and they still need to improve.
came here on a sat.
late morning and they did not have clam chowder nor garden veggie soup ready.
decided to get the chicken noodle and came out luke warm.
i came through the open door and was even greeted.
yell at your employees, not your customers!
so freaking unprofessional.
sold me a supposedly fresh salmon belly last week but it's rotten.
so..had a little time to kill.
just had foot surgery, but found out they have electric carts to use...
except that they are kept by the opposite entrance from the silverton casino side...
so i hobbled all the way across the store...no small feat considering the size..
finally got to the cart parking area..
and the only one remaining was a broken down p.o.s.!
dirty ,,delapidated and inoperable!!
thanks a lot bass pro for another let down!!
spoke to the customer service desk....they said it had been there for several weeks...
do the managers not have a f-n clue how to do their jobs ??!!
the food here is disgusting, every dish, every ingredient tasted rotten.
also, they will try to scam you whenever the opportunity arises.
they also use msg in everything here by default.
if you want fresh, tasty, good quality food, do not come here.
no pleasant surprises await you.
this is by far the worst service experience i have ever had!
he is extremely rude and just made the whole situation worse!
not a good experience on my first go.
i haven't been back, so it might have just been a bad night.
it was incredibly frustrating and unprofessional experience.
i was refused for medical treatment for 50 dollars a year.....
all they seem to care about is money.
thanks family practice really..
i needed immediate medical treatment and i was refused over 50 dollars!!!
we walked in and put our name in for two.
the wait was about 20-30 minutes.
when i asked her nicely about it she didn't know what to say.
i told her we were going to leave she rudely said ok bye.
this was our first experience and will be our last.
good night pediatrics gets no stars from me!
what happened to you good night pediatrics?!?
we have been coming to good night peds since they opened.
our last visit was horrible.
staff is so unfriendly with no personality.
dr gave us 5 minutes of her time and left.
plus they misdiagnosed my daughter!
do not bring your children here.
they really scraped the bottom of the barrel when hiring staff here!
if you are looking for challenge, then go for it.
worst furniture i've ever bought!
my chase lounge didn't even last through the summer
i called dave at az landscaping due to the good reviews here on yelp.
when i called him, it sounded like i woke him up.
he wasn't very apologetic and hung up.
food was ok but not spectacular.
service was horrible and took forever.
we kept having to ask for water and drink refills.
some of our party weren't drinking and we aren't in college anymore...
with each one, the maintenance and service has deteriorated more and more.
pool has been down for service three times.
even small repairs are not effective i.e. microwave handle.
management loves to give assurances but never follows through.
i used to order here often but i moved away from the area.
i came back to visit family this week and ordered takeout.
and i only got 5 pieces which is ridiculous.
when i called to ask whether this was normal they were extremely rude.
this was one of my favourite restaurants in richmond hill...
not anymore though.
very sad ...
because they use to care about their customers.
now, it's all about the money.
they have no compassion or heart.
not the best- or even close!
i would recommend "the habit" across the street.
coal burger burgers were overcooked and tasted like they were frozen.
the sweet potato fries were great though and so was the beer:)
just about every cuisine in this marketplace.
the experience was horrid.
miso ramen ($8.95) was the only food i had here.
i am a big fan of japanese ramen.
this miso ramen was the worst one i had in my life.
their menu is disorganized.
they need a lot of improvement.
i will not come back.
food is not very good here.
the pineapple margarita was gross.
the tropical drink was good.
the blossom was over cooked.
chili's is way better.
if i could give them a 0 stars i would do so.
yes it is if you are trying to save money!!!!!!!
no wonder they only have 2 stars!!!
bye- going elsewhere with my money....
but in reality, our stomachs were dying.
i don't recommend anybody trying this place.
i'm sure it will run out of business very soon
horrible place !
so ridiculous...who doesn't allow a cake for a kids birthday?
i don't recommend this place for a birthday.
their security guard is a major jerk.
he was more concerned with where i "parked "instead of providing other options.
apparently, we were confused about where to enter the blasted building.
i'm glad my aunt was only getting change from here.
i wouldn't spend a red cent from there.
sales people don't know anything about the systems they are selling.
sure enough, they messed it up....
it turned out that only 1 camera can transmit audio.
ok biscuits and ok chicken.
i didn't see my server often enough to fill my water.
twenty minutes, maybe more without even looking to see if someone may be thirsty.
won't be back
we live in vista, ca.
we've had cox for over 20 years.
they can't get their equipment to work.
read reviews on all the other review sites and don't use cox cable!
that should have been a warning!
even the rolls were hard as rocks.
skip this place.
if cheap and old is what you want then your at the right place
table booked few days before.
we notice on the table booking sheet they wrote 'haven't arrive' beside it.
so we question the remarks bedside our name.
the waiter told us it was mistake.
it was very disappointing.
food wise parents come here for dimsum.
to be honest, food are mediocre.
there are way more chinese restaurant have better standard.
i was told that we could t be seated until he got there.
she refused to seat us.
we left and went to red robin instead.
i thought it was bad customer service.
bad experience and service.
i made a reservation here that i needed to cancel.
i emailed the hotel 3 times and got no response at all.
never got a call.
what a pain!
has the health department ever visited this place.
the bathrooms were hideous, the food was bland.
staff was unfriendly, or just unhappy-- not sure.
if i had used the restroom first i would never had tried the food.
only stay here if its your very last resort.
i witnessed a murder and a attempted murder from my second floor window.
both within a week.
this place is only good for people who can't afford insurance.
the worst indian food i have ever had.
it is just nasty.
the eggplant dish we ordered was not edible.
we threw the entire thing in the trash.
and i'm not sure how you can make bad tikka masala, but they do.
absolutely no spice in "medium".
it was an hour wait for takeout.
do yourself a favor and go to chaupatti or saffron.
one of the worst hotels my family and i have ever stayed in.
paper thin walls.
monumental waste of money.
hot and ready is not happening got here at 1:30 it's now 1:58p.
and no pizza ready and it's just one of the hot ready pepperoni
i'm a little embarrassed that audi would have their a4 launch party here.
short staffed the night of a launched party, i'm displeased.
1 star buffet with a 5 star price.
quality down, complaints up.
it's sub par.
it wants me to right more.
i have nothing more to say.
what else do you want to hear?
ok. water was good.
this is also true of the sandwich.
i've never encountered such a beyond shitty delivery service.
who the hell delivers to a 9-5 office business at 8:00pm!?!?!
they reattempted delivery 5 other times - at 8pm.
i swear, i cannot wait to see this company go out of business.
i can't say enough how much i completely f**king hate them!
ive had a torn meniscus for a year and then he just says reschedule.
the most unprofessional conduct i have ever witnessed.
the treatment of the tenants is disgusting and management is extremely rude and dishonest.
have had to make multiple complaints to boardwalk customer service.
the egg and cheese bagel on easter was pretty sad.
now, that has changed.
make ccv great again.
35 minutes just to leave the damn airport!
bad product, bad attitude, stay away.
they touch the food with hands and no gloves.
food has dropped out of the window onto surfaces and placed before me.
tables are not wiped.
never recommending to anyone.
i was exited to try this buffet what a disappointment.
i could not finish it.
it was a a huge disappointment.
nothing really stood out and wowed me.
this was my last vegas buffet.
we ended up here to try it and see.
poor beer selection, bad service, rude bartenders.
vegas has many better options, explore the city but dont stop by this place.
not worth your time or money.
go somewhee else.
i wish i could give this place no stars.
my god these are the worst macarons i have every had in my life.
had the crme brulee and lemon macs.
i had spit mine out.
my husband took one bite and threw the rest away.
these were inedible.
cannot say enough about how disappointed i am in this chain practice.
i would not recommend this disrespectful practice to anyone.
worst bar in the n.
get rid of your regulars and maybe you will see some real business!
you need to clean up too!
the place smells like you have bar rot!!
i dont love this bar and grill.
the atmosphere is very impersonal.
the service was very slow.
not worth the price of the food or the wait.
there are so many other options in vegas to choose from.
went over with some friends the other night and we were not happy.
waiters were confused and food and plates were falling all around us.
note, go when they are slow because they cant handle the busy times.
like we say in the business, they were in the weeds.
waste of 80 dollars.
place was decorated pretty nicely.
i figured, you can't fuck up curry right?
man i was so wrong.
the food tasted really bad.
they probably just bought some packaged curry from the store and heat it up.
the worst indian food i have ever tasted..
i am writing this as i am eating here now.
indian food is all about flavour and there is absolutely no flavour.
and the quantity is depressing..
don't ever try
i travel extensively for work and constantly am renting cars.
i saw this company through hotwire and rolled the dice....
won't happen again!
are you freaking kidding me?!???!?!
stay away from this company!
worst sound and hidden fee.
charged for 30% service fee which was not shown on the bill.
all i see on the website is how customer service is #1.
ate a chicken corn dog & fries from here yesterday.
i've been sick ever since.
vomiting, diarrhea, chills, fever....definitely food poisoning of some kind.
they have a menu with combo prices but yet charges you individual prices.
a 8.50 combo turned out to be 11 bucks.
how does that happen.
lady in the drive thru said everything is individual pricing not combo pricing.
she didn't speak english anyway.
caucasian female bartender is awful!
i told the manager, who was eating lunch at the bar.
she wouldn't even stop eating to see what my concern was.
finally, she waved me over to over to her seat.
overall, this place is awful.
the really bad:* the room was absolutely awful.
* there was duct tape holding carpet and other things together in the hallway.
i honestly wouldn't stay here ever again.
horrible customer service.
i can't go back.
it isn't expensive but you definitely get what you pay for.
first time in denny's visiting vegas from nyc.
hmmm no avoid this chain.
can we say extra extra butter on everything including the butter?
lol yea no never again...
terrible experience every month.
been in line 20 + minutes and no one can even acknowledge my presents.
not sure if the employees are untrained or just not enough staff working.
moving to another pharmacy though.
although we had a delicious cheese and mushroom appetizer, we experienced poor customer service.
they would not remove the money from our bill and were extremely rude.
i will never go back.
the only good thing about this place, its its location!
cost me additional 15$ each to have my dry cleaners restitch them!
i have to come back to sherway again tomorrow to maybe take them home!
do not use this place!
expensive and bad quality of workmanship!
very few people in there, so this made no sense.
almost walked out without paying as we could not even get our checks!
terrible service, just terrible.
my first experience was how loud the terrible choice of music is.
it was a terrible experience.
i wouldn't eat there.
maybe other chipotle locations have better workers.
really really bad.
they even messed up bacon.
i've never had bad bacon before.
the french toast was just coated in frosting.
made me sick to eat.
just...really surprisingly bad.
customer service here is terrible !!!
never felt so discriminated in my 25 years in arizona.
choose your wardrobe carefully when considering this establishment.
might as well have eaten at mcdonald's.
they had pizza, fries, chicken balls which literally tasted like mcdonald's chicken mcnuggets.
would not return.
prosall you can eatcons -limited food.
for $30 go to chipotle across the street and have yourself a feast.
don't waste your time here.
do not go here if you need to change your name.
they call it "inconvenience fee".
the food runner was so lackadaisical it was comical.
for the money the quality of ingredients was very poor.
let us all be grateful that there are other restaurants!
i guess i'll just try out another gym then.
this was an absolutely horrible experience.
he said he could not do that and sent out the chef.
we left considering they couldn't accommodate in any way.
they had horrible service and a horrible attitude toward allergies.
do not recommend!
ate there and the food was good.
beware if you go they may steal money from you
my friend ordered a sweet lassi and they served salt lassi.
we had to call the server everytime we need something.
always unattended by them.
we got chicken pieces in an egg biryani.
if you are a vegeterian think twice before you eat here.
the food was def not fresh and was flavourless.
never going back.
and do not suggest anyone to try this place out.
ok heard the summerlin store head milkshakes,,not true.
slurp out of machine, the place was short staffed, dirty tables and floors.
ran out of catsup had to use packets!!
pass on this place.
the meat lacks any flavour.
kind of a waste of perfectly good pork.
please do not support this business.
try bunna coffee on power rd. in mesa.
much better atmosphere and coffee.
they were busy for ufc 208.
that's fine i get it.
she's busy mistakes happen.
the manager stared at me after she clearly told him what happened.
he stared blankly at me and didn't even come to apologize for the mistake.
further more the restaurant i work at is twice the size of this place.
disappointed since bp is from my home town.
i did a take out  and   i wont do it again.
pei wei in general is one of my favorite places.
i'm consistently ignored by the staff when i walk in.
find another pei wei.
the one in henderson on sunset is awesome, great service, awesome food.
sorry to say but just horrible.
had the won ton chip n dips and they were greasy.
she assured me it was real but guess what?!
the thai beef salad was lackluster ...
the greens soggy, the beef without flavor and chunky chewy slices ...
so disappointed all around!
i don't recall ever getting a prescription filled on time by this pharmacy.
every time you call, it's a different a excuse.
worst service ever!
i received a message from the manager and they are correcting things!
i will return to this location and give them another shot!
thanks for the quick response and taking the time to repair the situation
peter did a good job but kelly fixed my nail.
she was nice about it but they are super busy !!
the mcdonalds on highway 50 in brampton is terrible.
the lines are terribly long in drive thru always.
the service is slow and the food is always stale.
i hate going here but it is the closest location to my home.
over priced and extremely underwhelming.
trust me and skip this place.
i promise panda express is 10x better in every way; food, service and price.
had a great experience the first time, second time not so much.
not coming back.
not the brightest bunch.
i would never call this company ever again for a loan.
i can see why these guys have such a low rating.
the actual wash left half of my car i vacuumed.
purchased -  bedroom set ( the bed is falling apart pieces are falling off
was told i'd be able to stream movies and game at the same time.
load of lies.
can't even watch a full netflix movie.
ordered chili dog and fries take out.
cold, mediocre food that is way overpriced (prices more here than in la)!
sandwiches that are way overpriced.
and  s - l - o - w  service!
another store will close to overpriced food at subpar quality.
the air conditioner was dripping condensation onto the carpet, light and phone.
the smell of mold, and wet plastic/electronics was the answer to the smell.
i will never stay here again, and will steer my friends clear as well.
i called in for pickup.
when we went there to pick it up, it had the wrong toppings.
thinking of going to albion orchard this beautiful weekend with your family?
you may want to think again....
planning to bring a family of 7?
you must buy three bags before they will let your family in.
oh, and bags are $15 each...
we will not be coming back here again next year...
good products and location but bad management.
i was a bit disappointed during my first visit.
the worst pizziola in toronto.
i just stopped going to this particular location yonge/wellesley.
there are better pizziola's around yonge/bloor for instance is amazing.
the level of customer service at this company is horrendous.
i went to get lunch around 3pm after finishing a business call outside.
another potential customer came in and he refused to serve him too.
i bought a 2013 ford fiesta from this dealership one week ago.
the process for buying the car was excellent.
the no-haggle pricing and efficiency of scott, the salesman was refreshing.
however, today, the engine failed and needs to be replaced.
he filed the claim for my rental reimbursement.
although the buying experience was good, their response to this issue is extremely poor.
their beef and chicken on the rotisserie was old and hard.
i almost cracked a molar on their crappy meat.
i wil lnever go back there again and i had a shwerma salad.
tip: if you don't like your job then leave.
service makes or breaks a business and she broke it today.
i won't be back.
oh, and the spring rolls are obviously commercial bought.
this was the worst salon i have ever been too.
when i emailed management a picture of my hair, i never got a response.
it was unbelievable.
i would never recommend this salon to anyone.
simply horrible customer service at the store.
extreme disappointed with cox thanks to your incompetent employee chris.
called 2 days in advance to book a shuttle for my parents.
driver confirmed the address, pick-up time, and gave us a quote.
do not use this company!!
the food was okay but the service sucked.
horrible company with no customer service to speak of.
this one is kinda sketchy.
might make it a point to not walk in the actual station.
it's pretty dirty.
floors could use alot of water and a decent mop.
staff is mostly socializing and their mind is elsewhere.
i'll stop and pump but that's it.
just got to this location and brought my family from out of town.
first impressions, restroom is a mess!
will give more details after meal is done...
update* service is a little bit better.
waitresses looked super tired, probably from working long hours...
she is polite tho.
wait time for our table was ok...
not too long.
small portions, over priced for what you get, and food is just very fair.
total was $29.95.
a lot of money for that food!
i would give it a c.
plenty of other good and great restaurants to choose from.
i've experienced way better.
my opinion is you don't need to eat at this one.
the food is....
nothing wrong with it, nothing to brag about.
but the service is insanely bad.
was told 15 minutes for call in order.
i had to wait an additional 15 minutes when i got there.
food was decent, but not worth the hassle.
avoid if possible.
called in a lunch order at 11am, was immediately put on hold.
then i was told my order would be ready in 30 minutes.
spoiler alert - order wasn't ready in 30 minutes.
i got an attitude about my refund and a half assed apology.
and now i'm hangry.
worst pharmacy ever!!
joe blow could've been my signee!!
but they appear to be extremely unorganized and i will never go back!!
never again will i go to massage envy at rock springs.
the service has really gone downhill.
all the good therapists have left.
trying out boca park next week.
4 staff members standing at the self check out and not one on cash.
i just placed the items on the self check out counter and walked out.
that is my last time!
the manger of this location should be fired.
i'm giving this place one star solely based on the staff.
we got extra charges on our bill without notifying us in advance.
a no go for sure.
quality is just so so.
this was my first time here and will definitely be my last.
i spent $70 on their premium wash....it took them 2 hours to finish.
the air freshener lasted 24 hours.
i could've gotten a better wash down the street for $20.
i won't make that mistake again
this chuck e cheese had the rudest manager i have ever encountered.
the food had a perfume taste to it, meat was tough.
regardless of food the people were nice and curtious.
furthermore taco bell has more flavor than this dog food tasting trash!
worst part for me tho is and bartenders are rude and have an attitude.
do not recommend.
i'll take my money elsewhere next time.
wish i could put negative 50 stars ,this place is horrible .
this was my go to buffet breakfast when i came to vegas.
what happened to this place.
the quality of the food has gone down tremendously.
no flavor, fake eggs and no omelette bar on a saturday.
my wife started crying (more from embarrassment).
avoid this place!!
i don't recommend coming here.
i waited almost an hour after my appointment and still wasn't helped.
wasted my time.
in true honesty, i had the worst experience during my time here.
basically hated the fact that we were there.
way over-priced, young inexperienced staff and eric miller doesn't stand by his word.
charged me $495 for a kitchen faucet, which was installed improperly.
they came back, took the faucet and haven't reimbursed me one cent!
now they don't return my calls!
check out the other reviews about them here on yelp, repeat stay away!!
am i the only one who absolutely hates this place??
also, the service was horrible.
ain't nobody got time (or money) for that!
we "rented" a suite for one night at $89.
the tv was a tiny flat screen over the dresser.
i took pictures of previous "damage" in the room just in case.
we got our $75 rebated back on our credit card.
we will never stay there or recommend to friends/family.
rep at ticket countet kept my wallet with no notification..
no idea how anyone likes this slop.
bread is all soggy and way way way too big.
everything we tried was kind of tasteless and just weird.
meatballs are horrible.
side salad was a joke...i felt like i was eating weeds.
and...the bill was over $70.
i don't get it.
are people in cleveland clueless about what a good sandwich is?
service was amazing-- that's were it ended.
see my tip about the food.
when i got home,  i painted the toilet for over an hour!
nuff said, right?
this is the worst value as far as indian food.
they give such small portions and overcharge.
i would never recommend this to anyone.
the reason they are so slow is obvious.
a horrible experience.
t today is rather disappointing.
first of all, the waiters cannot follow the order.
the soup is the most uncomfortable food i have ever eaten.
so even after i finished eating i was thirsty and i felt uncomfortable.
it wasn't really a soup i had made.
will not go.
je n'y vais pas.
i guess they cater to the college students (sarcasm).
it was not a big deal cause i thought it would be fresh.
my hummus was frozen solid, my gyro was dry, no sauce and cold.
and my appetizer was cold as well.
i will no longer be going here.
rude employees here.
i politely informed the cashier that the turtle flipped on its back.
but i also know if they can't, they'll die of starvation & dehydration.
you work at a petsmart, you're not a zoologist.
i was just a concerned customer.
food is good!
unfortunately service sucks.
go to the one on fort apache.
better service and food is the same.
you know what's not complicated.
not picking home depot for this type of work ever again.
beware of this apartment complex.
management does not care about anything but money.
little to no security.
cars broken into and little attention to what goes on the property.
do not recommend this business.
these people are extremely dishonest and it's unbelievable they are still in business.
i fault myself for not doing research.
yeah just had a horrible embarrassing experience here and it was so lame.
this location is a mess.
slower than a drunk snail, cold food, dirty dining room, and shady staff.
gotta say, nothing like i remembered.
got the rib dinner with greens and mac n' cheese.
and worst of all, been in the bathroom all afternoon.
they look like they hate their job!
i might have to find another place to go to.
do not go here.
and the price was 2-3x more.
customer support is non-existant...
bought the 8 camera system from costco.
installed it and found out the 8th camera was dead out of the box.
they also don't respond to email with the ticket # referenced.
got a shellac manicure here that was terrible quality.
waste of $$!
stan used to be my go-to guy for everything hvac-related.
then one day he called to say he had completed a job of mine.
there was nothing unpleasant or untoward about our conversation.
indeed we have never exchanged a heated or unkind word ever.
he said he would make arrangements to get me my 2 keys back.
that was 2 mths ago.
i have called and called and never received a call back.
for the life of me i don't know what i did.
these guys don't deserve even half a star let alone a full one.
my mattress was stored without it being wrapped.
don't hire these jackasses!!!!
filibertos is the most garbage mexican food you can find.
this company was so bad that my warranty company no longer will use them.
the price is expensive, the service is hostile, and the food is mediocre.
the coffee is undrinkable.
i've never quite had such a unique and hostile dining experience.
i would recommend you spend your money elsewhere.
worse buffalo wild wings ever..
i was ignored didn't have anyone take our order...
lol never happened to me..
that explains why they have a very low score..
sad it's horrible i would never go here again..
they don't give a crap to keep you waiting.
i don't recommend this place at all.
i never had a problem with this company until this year.
my ac has been out since the 2nd of august.
couldn't get a repair out to my house until today 05aug2018.
this is vegas!!!
this heat is murderous!!!!!
there are 24 hour ac repair places but i had to wait 3 days.
you can't get ahold of anybody at this damn company.
this is my last year.
did the 60 minutes foot massage.
not only it was the worst massage ever.
it was the most ridiculous experience ever.
the masseuse demanded a 30% gratuity.
i have never heard such a thing.
i honestly would give this place 0 stars if i could.
one of the most unprofessional services i've ever had in my life.
would not stop talking throughout the entire facial trying to sell me her products.
do not recommend.
do not visit this business.
they should have told me my ac unit wasn't worth pumping freon into.
i do not recommend this business!
gods thing canes is only a few mikes away!
this company by far has the worst customer service i have ever experienced!
it dumbfounds me that unpleasant people are working in customer service.
this company must pride themselves on "the customer is always wrong" and never right.
there use to be an amazing store manager there named chris.
he was always nice honest and helpful.
this was one of the worst stay-cations we ever had.
the front desk was so rude.
the rooms were uncomfortable and lacked the feeling of a welcoming hotel.
it's not even worth trying.
not like other rosatis around the valley.
ridiculous customer service- management is non existent- & pizza was terrible.
don't even try.
i ate at this place expecting a great experience...
totally not the case..
the food was decent but the veal sandwich was super thin.
thin slices of meat breaded and placed in an over sized bun..
tried the food because of the hype.
bland food, and expensive prices.
bland, pricy, small portions and not worth my time.
spent $200 disappointment.
outrageous billing, especially considering service i received was just horrible.
i would not recommend going to them at all.
this place stinks!
i'll be supporting a different course come may thru sept.
after seeing how she behaved i didn't purchase anything from the store.
her behavior yesterday has upset me very much.
i don't think i will ever be back to store.
she argued very harshly and made unnecessary scene in the store.
every single encounter i had in the past have been a really bad experience.
the staff always have an attitude and can never conduct themselves professionally.
if you can avoid this place please do so.
trust me, you will save yourself a trip and a massive headache!
also the driver marked it was delivered twice for some reason.
they ruined my first and last amazon experience.
looks like i'm going back to ebay and ups.
you get what you pay for...
second time being delayed from vegas to fresno due to mechanical problems....
never fly this pos airline
almost $15 for an ok burger, fries, and shake......way too pricey.
think we will stick with 5 guys.
terrible pizza, terrible salad.
this has to be one of the worst pizza places around.
i've had frozen pizza that was better.
friendly staff but lousy food.
never will be going here again or recommending it to anyone.
my girlfriends separated from me and went here because trey songz was there.
they were literally being harassed.
what a disgusting night club.
this place is okay at best.
i didn't have anything that was better than average.
all the food was mediocre and overpriced.
easter sunday, made a reservation, didn't need to for good reason.
happy easter !!!!!
landry's i hope you can take this seriously.
dress code is noticeably racist, specifically targeting clothing associated with black people.
i have red bug bites all over both arms, hands and ankles.
also, there was a constant smell of marijuana in the halls.
was told someone would be there to help me in under an hour.
nearly 2 hours went by before the cops helped me out instead.
no one from larry's ever showed up.
he then forgets to put my points for the two smoothies as well.
i'll make sure not to come in when he's there.
poor service with a waitress with a very bad service.
i would recommend locals and visitors  to not keep on passing by.
if you do eat here good luck.
this nunzio's location used to be my go-to for pizza.
unfortunately, within the past year, they've changed their recipe and lowered the quality.
they refused to look at the car for her?!?!
big 2 took care of the replacement literally in 10 minutes...
this panera drive is terrible.
i used to be a huge fan of brewsters.
used to come once a week for years.
food quality has gone down hill.
frozen burgers for $16 bucks.
what a joke.
i hope it does, they really had something going.
we frequent motel 6's frequently and this was by far the most disgusting.
we usually have no issues and things are pretty clean!
we decided to stop patronizing there because they treat their customers too rude.
regardless, they won't get another penny from us.
back of house is closed.
it's sad, but was probably inevitable.
i will miss this place.
this place is ridiculous.
they were rude and speaking to each other in only spanish.
they gave me pico de gallo instead of salsa for chips and salsa.
the burrito i got was flavorless and expensive!
this place is disgusting and not authentic at all.
they also refused to serve fries because it is brunch?
won't be back!
poor food quality, poor service.
food didn't look fresh.
almost looked like reheated microwave stuff.
she never got back to me.
they stated they would contact her and she should contact me soon after.
i waited another 10 days and finally requested a refund from groupon.
this was about a  six week process.
then another 10 minutes went by and it never came out.
this is redoculous and i felt so disrespected.
i will certainly not be coming here again.
ordered a whole spread for a group of us for takeaway.
they claim to make indian food.
they do not.
every meal plate was 90% rice, 10% order.
told me it would be 45 minutes to ready...
took just shy of two hours, not to mention luke warm upon arrival.
food was bland.
wouldn't save it for leftovers - and i love leftovers.
total disappointment, would find it very hard to go back.
ughhhh i usually love einsteins but this one is so horrible!!!!
the ice tea was soooo bad i literally thought i was drinking urine.
my bagel was so cold, dry and chewy but in a bad way.
seriously so nasty.
i will not be back here or any einstein because of this.
how hard is it to make a bagel!
oh and it barley had any creme cheese on it just chewy cold bread
we waited forever and food didn't come.
decided to leave...
postino sorry for one star but you should take a look in to it.
i hope that you will hire better people.........!!!!!!!!!!!!
not impressed with office at all.
it's more like a free clinic than a doctors office.
transferred me to a another line.
i don't have time for all of that, not returning.
chicken was not jerk chicken and was very tough to eat ...
seasoned fries are more like cold fries with no seasoning ...
and i already feel sick from eating here.
do not eat here before a flight unless you have iron stomach.
below average food quality.
everything was cold and flavorless.
i would not recommend this buffet.
there are other higher quality buffets in vegas.
love terry and dr tummala but have had recent issues with office staff.
i recently changed insurance plans and called to ask if they accepted my insurance.
i was told they did and scheduled my appt.
they never called my insurance and will not take responsibility for their mistake.
this practice looks down on mothers.
dr. scott firczak has no kids.
he compares raising his dogs to raising children.
he insults those that sacrifice so much.
there are tons of good chiropractors out there.
on another note: the parking lot is awful!!
always deliver way past the estimated time.
food never feels fresh, even when i pick it up.
today i got my food and my order wasn't even correct..
won't be ordering from here again.
i feel as if i waste money every time i order from here.
i'm her big brother and expected to treat her to whatever she wanted.
he followed me out, questioning me about the tip amount...
then saying i'll take ur extra cup to compisdae  for ur lack of tip.
we don't need the money let alone the food...
we came for the entertainment
i then got home with my haul and figured out why; nothing was good.
we bought a cinnamon roll and a sticky bun.
such a big carrier with a huge number of subscribers is not accepted?
i'm sure they've got their reasons but i'm really disappointed!
the one star is for the novelty of the steak on a stone.
you will regret it as every tastes terrible.
feel ripped off!
$144 for less than 45 min of work and we supplied the parts.
i'm in the wrong business!!
were told we'd "have to speak to accounting".
ordered a steak burrito bowl.
basically i ended up with a veggie burrito.
won't be visiting this location again.
they said it couldn't be shipped in anything but a ups box!
yes it could...boxes don't matter, the label is the important thing.
such a rip off to make a buck!
oh, the beer selection is ok but over priced.
usually a nice spa...
today my therapist decided not to come to work i guess.
walked around trying to find an associate to help and not one i saw.
after walking around for about 10 min i was walked out.
i'll spend my money somewhere else.
absolutely the most unprofessional customer service i have experienced.
i have never encountered such horrible customer service!
she was extremely rude and i would never recommend this store to anyone!
she actually never said "hello" and never smiled.
can't say this was a good experience and i won't be back.
look for a doctor who thoroughly explains what she is doing and why.
i expected better quality of service during my visit but was very disappointed.
i wanted to go to the airport.
i booked a car for 1:45 pm.
i called at 1:55 pm.
i was told the cab would be there in 2 minutes.
he showed up at 2:05 pm: a full 20 minutes late!
this isn't what you need when you are trying to catch a flight.
update: the following year, i found someone reliable: "z limo service": 514 567 2332.
i called the store thinking they gave it to the wrong house or something.
the store is 5-7 mins away tops.
it did not get here until just now ( 2:15 pm ) !!
that's nearly an hour late !
no wonder they were cold.
i am truly disappointed and will not be ordering from this store ever again!!!
they truly do not care about their customer service at all.
ok. they told me parts would be in 7-10 days, ok.
i have a feeling this sort of thing happens a lot.
don't bother leaving a message as no one calls you back.
in actuality: the man there on 12/6/2017 did not return my phone message.
now he's hiding behind his answering machine like a dirty little rat!
at no point did he even offer any kind of service.
all this company did was kick a guy when he was down.
i will be in touch.
i will be in touch.
the service here is the worst!
and they had plenty of open tables.
the wait staff never said a word, or looked at us.
i wouldn't even eat there for free!!!!
we walked out1
these are a far cry from that in taste, texture and appearance.
the crap at jack in the box should be recalled by the fda.
i feed my cat better texturizied canned food.
took over 30 mins for drinks.
another 30 for food (that was cold).
server never checked on the food or asked us if we wanted another drink.
we sat for 10 mins with completely empty plates and drinks.
tisk tisk earls.
poor bussing of tables.
strange behavior among wait staff!
manager called to inform her about all the food on seats!
all she said was that she'll mention it to the bussers.
no one is smiling!
lines are picking up!
must be short staffed.
must be a management problem.
this is definitely not happy hour!
dr. hopkins is the most indifferent, aloof and uninvolved doctor i have ever had.
all dr. hopkins does is sit in his office and collect his paycheck.
i even contacted the college of physicians and surgeons to file a complaint.
find a different doctor.
you deserve to have your health concerns addressed.
if you have a choice,  steer clear of this gym turned frat house.
the only thing going for this gym is its location.
real attitude problems amongst its staff members.
you might even catch them talking behind your back right in front of you.
life is too short  to be a wynn fitness member!
look at that!
their new slogan!
it's like if you have a horrible personality they hire you!
literally their only job is to hand u and make ice cream....
don't waste your time here there are so many good ice cream spots!!!
don't go to this thing in 2018 or ever!!
this is the worst post office in the history of usps.
it should be closed down  asap!
typical steakhouse menu and dark atmosphere.
desire was great, but that was all.
dinner for 2 for $100 and i didn't eat anything, awesome!
been here before for service, i thought it was overpriced.
bad communication amongst the staff caused me to repeat myself  to three different people.
worse experience ever.
worst experience ever.
used them to install water heater and gas line.
the screwed up both installs.
they installed the wrong heater.
then charged me to remove the incorrect water heater and reinstall.
what a letdown and disappointment.
i took a family of 4 during breakfast hours and nobody was impressed.
this used to be better in years past.
i unfortunately can't recommend this place.
i have never dealt with a singularly more incompetent or uncaring or clueless company.
yet, they handle my prescriptions with the seriousness of a flintsones vitamin.
it typically requires 2-3 calls/day for 2-3 days before a medication is sent.
if your looking for a good school to better your self run!
i went to this school in 2010 and it was very unprofessional.
so here i am with 6000 dollars in deat and no degree.
wynn and encore casino do next to nothing wrong.
sadly, red 8 is the single exception.
had a meal here, and was terribly disappointed.
bland, no flavor, nothing interesting about it at all.
and being in las vegas, of course it was very expensive.
would never go back or advise a good friend to visit.
i might suggest my worst enemy enjoy a meal here however.
if we could give 0 starts we would, or maybe -5.
my advice is to stay away.
i use to this chick was nice.
think she's a manager too.
i was just there to get a rabies vaccination.
oh my goodness.
well, it tasted decent at the time.
but, when i got back to my hotel...i soon discovered i got food poisoning.
it was horrible!
i was running to the bathroom all night long.
i suggest you avoid the buffet.
it was a terrible night.
this was in late august 2015, around the 25th.
at this point if yelp would let me put no stars i would!
this place is horrible!!!
which you would think is great right?
i mean this is so unbelievable avoid at all costs.
these people are awful!
the company is run like uber or lyft without the professional service.
the drivers use their own private vehicles.
unethical, unprofessional, and unreliable.
the service was poor, and the food was mediocre.
i was hoping for some authentic tex-mex food but the food is very bland.
avoid if you're looking for a good experience and great food
apparently they were on lunch break and never communicated  this to us.
very unprofessional and will never recommend this office!
i've never felt so skeptical of a place always trying to rip me off.
they won't install your parts unless you over pay for theirs..
well they misled me i did research and they were wrong.
i found them to be rude, no bed side manners at all.
i don't recommend this doctor or the staff.
i wanted to leave their immediately.
had terrible experience here.
he was lazy, just doing the minimum.
couldn't even paint the polish on the nail.
gosh, what was i thinking.
total waste of money.
talked to him about a landscape  job.
he took all the information  and never heard  from, that was 18 months ago.
i think it was not big enough for him.
the take out...
ya can't fake it with sushi either its fresh or it isn't .
it looked grubby and the menus were sticky.
altogether this place deserves zero stars
was on the way to place a to go order but they closed early.
disappointed but they said they lacked business tonight so i guess i understand.
no decafe espresso for latte.
they lost my business.
forced us to go elsewhere.
looked like the pastries were interesting but no decafe espresso no pastry.
ended up down the street where we found decafe and pastry.
have stayed many times.
love the rooms and atmosphere.
shame since i spend $1000's while there.
limited rooms i know.
old tvs etc.
but always comfy.
shame i guess won't come back
stopped by ryu sushi bar for a quick lunch?
i ordered gyoza, a shrimp tempura roll and a spicy crab roll.
the gyoza was flavorless and lacked filling.
the seaweed was tough and chewy.
it seemed to wad up like a piece of chewing gum.
i won't be returning!
i have never experienced this before at any other sushi place!
worst service ever in my life.
by far the worse lasagna i've ever had in my life!!!
it was citrusy for some reason...
the picture menu specifies lasagna and salad but they only give you a lasagna...
with a stale piece of bread!!!
i don't think so.
(1 token = $2).
the tacos i had were nothing special.
i left hungry after spending $25 total.
this event is the biggest ripoff ever.
this place is so expensive.
wow, has this place gone downhill.
steaks are choice (at best) not prime.
the other items are just not worth having at all.
the manager was willing to make zero accommodations on any changes.
just an oldie looking tired.
first and last time.
we ordered half a dozen pastries.
the turnovers were disappointing.
none had even a teaspoon of filling.
while everything was baked to look appealing....we felt cheated.
i got the feeling they were cutting corners on the ingredients.
went in to get my daughters dress hemmed for prom.
when they realized i needed it so quickly, the price went up $40.
$90 to get a dress that isn't lined is completely outrageous .
gouging at its finest.
service was horrible...
waiter dripping with sweat, chefs dont wear gloves when handling food...
my boyfriend gave them a one dollar tip that they didnt even deserve.
rude staff the entire duration, and way too over priced drinks.
honestly, never coming here again.
by far the worst check city ever!
this place definitely needs new management because this business is being ran like crap!
horrible, horrible, horrible check city location!
this check city location is horrible!!!!!!!!!
long waits even when slow!
was at er for over three hours and there were two people there.
watched a full shift change.
save yourself the trouble and go to cmc waxhaw, it's a lot better!!
the waitress told her manager, who had no idea what to do.
charter tv sucks, high prices going up every year.
if we were given another choice i would try it.
and no satellite is not a choice.
fried dumpling was so dry that impossible to eat.
in summary: food worst than in cheap thai places for the double price.
service slow, bad and insolent.
this place is a falsely advertised urgent care facility.
i went in for the flu.
i am going to fight this if i can because this is ridiculous!
when i got there eric handed me off to andreas.
do not go to this dealership.
a bunch of scammers.
i hate to be critical, but i can't help it in this case.
this is a broken down facility, understaffed and very slow.
i would not recommend this company to anyone.
i would give zero stars if that was an option
sadly, i was not treated in a manner which i considered professional or respectful.
disappointing, very disappointing.
tried this place twice.
when i complained to corporate about the brown salad she offered me a coupon.
i mean really how can you serve two hard boiled eggs on benedict ?
what's worse is they don't fix it.
go spend your hard earned cash somewhere else.
diversified truck is unapologetic about fleecing you.
my last invoice reads total parts=$2.28.
then there were material costs +$7.24.
i do not know what that even means.
in the end, two small light bulbs needed to be replaced.
total costs 82.55.
i should be pissed but i am not.
i walk in knowing i am about to get screwed.
they didn't disappoint.
very dissatisfied in the food.
furthermore, can someone please explain to wp the meaning of service?
he needs to hire shawn from libertine to train his bartenders.
sad, considering wp's name is on the wall.
abercrombie needs to be sued for discrimination of it's internal employees.
no stars, only one is because i'm required.
i wish i can give negative star.
the worst service worst pizza and at the end they argued.
similar experience happened multiple times with this location.
came in at 8:15 on a saturday evening.
the sign outsides reads 9 pm as the closing time.
i understand seating the last table at 8:45 but 8:15?
why not close at 8 then.
this restaurant never has good service nor have i ever been delivered hot food.
this is consistent whether they are busy or not.
worst service ever!
leaving and looking for a new bar!
i know someone who has been working for this company for over a year.
he started off great!!
he's reliable and a great worker!!
stay far away!!!!!
easily some of the worst service i've ever had.
over priced and overrated at even one star.
food average at best.
beers ok if you can get any.
lots of better options out there.
i decided i was done.
won't be back
i recently called for a screw that had fallen off my drapery rod.
i couldn't figure out how to attach it since the sides didn't match.
repairman came, and made repair.
that cost me $75 for a little screw.
shame on you!
never will call you again...adrienne o
the worst possible service and overpriced drinks, fired the staff and managers!
how embarrassing for las vegas!
they do not care about their customers, at all.
liars and very deceptive.
horrible customer service
the worst pizza hut we have ever been to, with the worst service.
it turns out that the person didn't even take the order right.
a very poorly run pizza hut with absolute horrible service.
this company is a joke!!!!!!!
we waited for 6 hours and they never showed up at all!!!!
robin the manager never had the respect to call us back.
living social should take them off the website and i would never recommend them.
i called moveaholics jason was amazing he even offered to come out that night.
he is amazing call him if you want real movers 480-305-3793
i called my friends in the club, and everyone left and we went elsewhere.
i will never come back to gold spike.
this place has really a really rude person working here.
just go up the street to domino's.
extremely rude cashier and staff at this location.
unwilling to help and trying to sell used returned items off as brand new.
too over price and service is so bad.
one time only,not coming back!
this place doesn't even deserve 1 star.
it got one star because of the wine and i brought my own.
never have i ever experienced terrible service like this.
our reservation was at 8:15....oh we are still here waiting for food!
just more bs...
closing at 4pm during the week...
i hate bofa with such a white hot hatred at this point!
my work continues to use this awful institution so i can't escape it.
hate hate hate bofa!
the service was bad from the minite we walked in.
she replied with "oh we don't have anymore".
seriously one of the worst experiences i have ever had.
i hope this establish steps up its' game.
i ordered spaghetti and meatballs on uber eats and they refused the order.
guess $25 with salad, garlic bread and delivery fee wasn't enough.
decent prices, but very disorganized.
i got 3 different methods on how to treat a nail removal.
had the worst experience with safeway this week.
it's now 3:30 and i've heard nothing from anyone.
when i was looking for gluten free dining in boulder city this came up.
the food is mediocre.
the menu is very limited.
panera is much better with many more choices.
if i could give them negative stars i would.
do not go here
everything is a little low grade.
service, food and drinks.
it's a nice looking place but that would be it.
stay away from any cocktails, they're awful.
stick to wine and/or beer here.
be careful of bartenders with attitude.
only a cashier to your order.
i showed the waitress and told her.
i'm going leave.
didn't want anything else from there.
i left a couple bucks for the server and we spilt.
i bought two  kim bab !!
,, l never had this kind of terrible taste .
i hope make a better kim bab .
waste my money.
this place is way too overpriced end of story.
i ordered the meatloaf dinner.
the meatloaf was good and that was it.
the mashed potatoes were cold and the vegetables were gross.
i wouldn't recommend this place and definitely won't be back.
5 rolled tacos are soggy, it was fried in a rush.
i'm p'd off.
i called, and they were willing to refund me.
but i'll just stop going here.
first time when i went there, the line was too long so i left.
a year went by, i had another chance to try the place.
after waited in such a long line and paid that much money.
i was very disappointed.
the food was so so, nothing stood out.
the services were average but below par if you considered it's in a hotel.
you will have a lot better buffet in paris, trust me.
let me say, not good.
my nail remains.
just out of curiosity i went to mec.
guys at mec fixed it for $15!!!!
and they had a spare axle.
moreover, service at  mec is significantly better.
great space but the food was not.
i went with the group of people for lunch.
egg rolls were okay, crispy but a little bland.
i was very excited to try omg sushi...
turned out to be very disappointing.
definitely appeared to be shorting customers to save a dime.
sakana sushi is a much better choice!
this is the second time i've eaten here.
it was ridiculous!!
so in turn i expected a bit more professionalism with lynn.
we would've given them such good business - too bad their service was subpar!
every time i go here my order is wrong.
it took 12 mins to get 2 items in the drive through.
i am never coming back here again.
i arrived more than 10 minutes early for my appointment.
i had to leave because i had other affairs.
i didn't even get an explanation on why the doctor never even came in.
i will never come back.
worst experience ever!
what a loss
disgusting portions of cheap and unhealthy grub.
and long lines.
the service at this place sucks.
i ordered the tuna sandwich and it honestly wasn't that great at all.
their fries arent all that and this place isn't worth the money they charge!
i go to vegas alot and i'm never going back here.
horrible customer service!
then they say but we can give you a car or mini van.
horrible horrible horrible!
the breakfast menu gives the appearance that their food is fresh and substantial.
however, the quesadilla i ordered was the exact opposite of fresh and substantial.
there was more grease in my quesadilla than there was quesadilla!
this was an unfortunate visit.
in short, avoid this place because the hostess is the worst in the industry...
i waited 45 minutes to finally walk out because of the hostess's unprofessionalism.
i read the reviews and took a chance these reviews don't lie!
terrible customer service!
go with anyone else but dependable auto shippers
staff doesn't know what the hell it's doing.
one scoop of chicken for a large salad, how ridiculous!
they add on extra cost without telling you.
and it's completely overpriced.
don't waste your time here.
for god sakes, any salad is better than this.
i ordered take out for two house special pho and deep fried spring rolls.
the pho broth was so bland that i had to add salt.
the pho was $9 for absolutely nothing but lots of bean sprout.
and the spring roll was crispy with very little to no meat inside.
sadly i love dts and appreciate having close to home spots for cocktails.
this one is off our list.
don't stay here!!!
horrible customer service!!!!!
if i could give zero or negative stars- i would.
this company was dispatched to me through my insurance.
they were to be there between 30-60 minutes.
stay far away.
went once with my family when i was 18 and the food was okay.
will never go again or recommend this terrible place to anyone.
their products are fine, but their service is the worst.
we bought a chest of drawers and large dresser in may.
the customer service people make promises and commitments and do not follow up.
they are like the anti-nordstroms.
when it happens to you, do not say you were not warned.
food was really bad quality.
i paid $20 for a plate of bad food and a water.
really bad even for airport food
service in this place sucks.
counter person was oblivious--i walked out.
that's it--no more of this crap
delivery was fine but the food was terrible.
never ordering from them again.
i go every month to labcorp for my blood test.
never an issue.
here i did one blood test and well the picture speaks louder than words.
note im a pretty happy camper with mostly 5 stars kind of guy.
this people ruined our wedding day !!!
maybe their other dishes are good but i will not return to find out.
nothing they say is true and they blatantly steal from their customers.
this is a company with 0 moral compass.
do not use their service!!!!!!!!!!!
when we got our drinks they weren't to their full potential.
very disappointed, will never go back to that location.
do not go to this location.
very rude guy!
the server was another story.
i got up & asked to get it to go.
i won't be returning as i will spend my money elsewhere.
went today for lunch about an hour after they opened.
fries were hardly warm and tasted old.
we do not recommend this place something has changed.
we are rating one star and giving it 2 thumbs down.
so i get a coupon for $14.99 at jiffy lube...
i just ordered a salad and it had at least three things wrong.
i asked for no tomatoes and it was covered in them.
i received the wrong dressing and was missing my sauce.
i won't be back..
staff was no where to be found.
all of vegas was booked and of course this place has vacancy.
i would've been happier sleeping in my car.
parking is crappy and rooms are worse than your local roach motel.
if it's between this or the roach motel- i pick the roach motel.
the place is only 9 minutes from where we're staying so this is ridiculous.
if you want your food in a timely manner then do not order here.
will update once food finally arrives.
it is currently 11:55pm.
we ordered at 10:30pm..
they might as well sell vacuums and porta-potties because their shit sucks.
random gigantic $200 bills?
fix your shit century link.
doesn't have to be all of it, at least suck less in one area.....
this use to be our favorite strip restaurant.
we would often go for the amazing brunch that they *use to* have.
it was the most bland overpriced food i've ever had.
worst off, it was $21 just for my cauliflower and quinoa dish.
i know the strip has inflated prices but this place is ridiculous.
calamari was good.
every pasta was bad.
cocktails were ok.
save your $25/entree and go somewhere else.
they told me it is rust but they swear they didn't do it ??
we will not be coming back here anymore.
if i could give no stars i would.
sad because this is the first negative review i've written smh.
my company uses this enterprise on a weekly basis.
we need a car each tuesday, wednesday and every other thursday.
since october, they have been on time only twice.
first time to this location will never come back.
very poor service and quality of food.
very disappointed !
he has no care in the world about what goes on there.
stay away from this dumpster.
hopefully one day this sewer will be closed down.
worst experience ever.
different attitude after i paid for the car and bad customer service.
i i'm converting electrical stove to a gas range.
technician came did not have much customer service qualities.
he did not sound very professional, will spend more time to get second opinion.
after i moved in i was beyond disappointed with the management and maintenance staff.
trouble tickets take forever to be "completed".
maybe a decent place to buy a 10 year old lawnmower.
not friendly nor helpful.
probably visited a dozen times and had consistently rude service.
first time here.
awful awful awful service.
waited 25 minutes for a beer to be delivered.
waited 30 minutes for food.
waited 25 minutes for the check.
so not returning!
i had don joseph do recall work on a vehicle.
i had to return twice to get them to correct it.
i am new in town and stopped by for dinner.
when i got home i was a little confused being from brooklyn ny.
i have never seen eggplant cooked in a deep fryer in my life.
it seems like it might have been over cooked???
i couldn't do it anymore so i threw it out.
my dog would bite me if i fed this to him.
we went here since we had a living social deal expiring.
the service was pretty bad and half of my meal was cold.
i  was interested in trying the "toda la experiencia".
she told me to go talk to the bartender (in a dismissive manner).
i asked the bartender for the card, and she couldn't find it.
i was disappointed since i went to the venetian to try this experience.
here it is monday and the car still not done.
it will be two weeks tomorrow.
my front bumper had minor damage.
they never called me to update me on anything.
the only positive thing i have to say is the lady name melinda.
poor quality oysters and crab.
zero flavor in the crab legs.
the meat was sort of brown...
oysters luke warm.
not a fan.
overpriced for the poor quality of seafood.
it was crowded.
the food is mediocre at best for greek.
the fries were over salted and the meat is not bursting with flavor.
staff is friendly but seems overwhelmed.
i am very disappointed.
i will be reaching out to my boyfriend to contact www.groupon.com for a refund.
terrible customer service!!
i only went to eat there because it was open after 10pm.
asked the waiter what soup was popular and he suggested the monk fish soup.
the service was terrible and the server that cashed me out was super rude.
i'm so done with this salon.
i guess my great run is done.
i loved coming in.
officially my last attempt to give anyone at this place a chance.
don't bother with this location, they do not have it together there at all.
horrible communication, and because of it, i am without my prescription now.
forgot our rice.
all the food seems to be cook in a rush.
food was not good.
we haven't ordered since.
the only pros:free delivery and their lemon chicken is good.
i'm going to be honest here, the service sucks!
no birthday song and all of that stuff.
just steer clear and spend your money at mcdonald's or in and out!
food is so so and deserts are not good at all.
prime rid is hard like rubber.
i have eaten in many places.
for the amount they charge this place is a big letdown.
better spend your $ somewhere else.
also parking is much more than the other place next to it.
i ordered the pulled pork sandwich.
the bread was stale and not edible.
that did not help me.
the barbecue itself was fine, nothing spectacular.
the potato salad was very good.
his bun was also stale and dry.
what a huge disappointment.
loud beyond belief.
food was just okay.
do not buy the extended warranty here...
or anything in general!
and they will not cover it.
don't bother, go somewhere else.
my mom has been here twice.
food always cold.
there is no places for anyone to sit outside but one bench out front.
rehabilitation here is awful.
probably some of the worst chinese and food in general i have had.
steer clear of this place.
ordered 2 portions of the $50 australia- grown wagyu and this meat came out...
was told that it's the striploin.
asked what grade it was and they couldn't tell me.
no offer to even make a partial refund.
tastes just like any boiled beef.
tasted just like the beef they sell at $25 in the same store.
would not recommend this tour.
there were 12 people cramped on our boat.
the driver talked 2 hours non-stop.
with 12 people, only a couple of fish were caught - all very small.
not a worthwhile outing.
very disappointed in their customer service and will never visit this harkins again.
stay somewhere else this place is nothing like it use to be.
staff doesn't seem to care and the place is run down save your money
oh, the disappointment...terrible food, terrible service, and really terrible bartenders and drinks!
they said oh, it's in a clear garlic sauce...wtf???
the bartender said...we don't have that ...
where do you think you are?
so accommodating when you signing up !
different story when you want to cancel the membership !
you can sign up from any location but u have to.
cancel from where you signed up .
did not work for me.
i rented an inside climate controlled unit for what seemed like a reasonable rate.
its been 3 months and my washer is still broke
apache junction is a town and we are aji.
sorry aji i'll have tofind another gun shop fromnow on.
this is the 3rd time i've experienced rude people from that shop.
the 14 ounce rib eye, was in 2 pieces,  and over cooked.
getting a repair done here was a bad experience.
they take weeks for even small repairs, and they are bad at communicating.
check out the google reviews lol.
this restaurant is the worst of lebanese foods .stay away.dirty people
isn't that the same thing and don't you want to say yes to guests?
the server was rude and transactional as could be .
go there for the convenience only.
food is poor, service is barely better.
i see your business reported my original post and had it taken off.
yes i had the right business.
tonight (11-16-17) i stopped at the nicole in henderson, off eastern.
don't order from here!
i ordered a pizza and well done wings and they gave me chicken fingers.
i will not be coming back here.
ordered the pad thai which had undercooked noodles and was way too sour.
the red curry was sweet, and the yellow curry was bland.
will avoid this place from now on.
no one cares at all.
thee worst place to order online.
twice i've ordered from this place and has messed up my order.
how does someone eat dry a** salad?!
this place is just a waste of money!
i contacted chris in regards to a hinge repair i need for my laptop.
slowest drive through line i've ever been in for a starbucks.
will not be back at this location.
probably the worst pad thai of my life.
the delivery was fast to downtown.
delivery driver hitting on the receptionist at my hotel was awkward as all hell.
did i mention that nothing on offer is  actually $5
j'ai commander 50$ de nourriture et c'tait teeeeellement dcevant, les samosas n'taient pas frais.
reheated pre cooked food.
soft vegetables and tough as jerky chicken
the food is good, but the delivery service sucks.
this is the second time he has done this.
do not rent from this company!!
i booked a place with them in february for an august trip.
my attorney is looking into breach of contract charges against this company.
but they will never get my business again!!
my flight left at 5:30.).
reservation quote was $158, left with a contract at $405.
good for you payless, you got extra money from me this time.
but good for me, will never use your business again.
the buffet was by far the worst buffet i've ever been too.
unfortunately, they didn't.
would not recommend this buffet.
incredibly rude staff, but the beer is okay.
if you like beer that tastes like coffee farted into an orange peel.
party of 5, 6 pm reservation, show at 8.
we didn't get our food until 7:30.
what a huge disappointment.
we'll never go back and we will discourage others to do the same.
slow service and bad food!
then i decided to order teriyaki chicken sandwich and it was too salty.
i also bought coconut buns and it tasted old and stale.
their milk tea was so chalky and nasty.
every freaking thing i ordered was pretty bad and gross.
never going back to that place again.
do not go here!
i ended up going to another dentist to fix that.
nothing out of the ordinary.
sloppy serving areas.
no server around to slice beef or serve gelato.
best thing was our very attentive waitress.
there has to be a better buffet.
was left on hold for 20 minutes.
no call back
one star because we got kicked out!
i believe he thinks his place is a museum.
it says they close at 12 so where was someone?
this pizza was so nasty.
i paid 50 bucks for a whole pizza and salad.
i was so disappointed with this cardboard they call pizza.
i don't see how these other yelpers gave it a good review.
we ordered half pepperoni and other half spinach with ricotta   cheese  and tomatoes.
pepperoni was sour spicy and smelled bad.
i like thin crust but this crust was cardboard.
you will have a better experience if u just order dominos pizza.
make sure you give a tip or u will be ignored by the staff.
my first time experience was a terrible one.
i am not impressed with this place, my original review makes this clear.
businesses up and down central ave were busy, especially hula's.
food was okay but they up-charge for anything they get a chance to.
but don't try to charge me for something i didn't even order.
i cannot recommend this business.
where have your standards in quality at this store disappeared to?
went in early on saturday, really wanting some hazelnut coffee before work.
i counted 8 staff members - more than customers by far.
sure enough, got 1/3 cup before it ran out.
they called for this person twice and i decided it wasn't worth the wait.
never wanted my $1.98 back more than this morning!
will take the few extra minutes to go somewhere else.
so far the common link seems to be lush.
bought a 6" meatball sub that had only 3 meatballs in it.
also, they billed us and our insurance a ridiculous amount for what we got.
maybe they will have in future.
thanks again jeremyyou know your trees !!
love the way the tree trimcame out.
i've got a lot of treeson the property.
they all lookgreat.
fruit trees to palm trees.
this place is a joke.
they are unprofessional, rude, and don't care about doing a good job.
they're interested only in the almighty dollar.
watch your dollars closely because they will overcharge you if you don't pay attention.
she refused to let us drink our coffees so we unfortunately left.
terrible customer service.
she should have offered to pour our coffees into one of their own cups.
my wife and i went to bld in chandler.
the food was not good.
could have done much better.
although the service was good.
food was "eh"...
service was seriously lacking!
owners / mgmt.
nowhere to be seen....
they talk to their coworkers too much instead of focusing on the costumer.
i left frustrated and will be finding a new nail salon to go to.
food here is really one note.
the lemongrass chicken wings were so dry and overly sauced.
came to nascar, walking to the front...
i guess he thought i was a scalper?
i've never been to nascar or lv speedway....
perch was awful, clams were sandy, waiter knew nothing.
overpriced and pretty bad = never again.
samedi soir du grand prix...
out of baked potatoes at a steak house!
the salesman was either in on the scam or just didnt know any better.
the owner croxen....
well he needs training which of course means the entire sales team needs training.
i ordered the goat cheese and jalapeo marmalade quesadilla to go.
it is now three days later and i never received a call.
very unsatisfied customer!!!!
would give no stars if i could!
not to mention the lines are extremely uneven!
do not come here!!
extremely over priced, go to the spa for this price.
the bartender's tonight are the absolute worst.
a couple dudes with no personality, walk right past you with empty drink glasses.
they have no skills and no clue.
you need girls behind the bar.
these guys suck bad.
spend the extra $5 and go somewhere else!
my friends actually laughed at the results.
sides weren't colored and nails were going over my natural nail onto the skin.
then they tried to charge me $10 to remove the crappy job.
while i was in there another girl was complaining about her nails too.
i will definitely be switching pharmacies.
i have two small children and can't risk them messing up medications.
not sure what's happened to this place but very disappointed in today's experience.
my family has visited multiple times and drive 45 minutes just to race.
how is that our problem?
just lost a loyal customer
in the drive thru.
then they lost my order and i had to reorder.
i ordered a third time.
check your orders people!!
she said everyone was new, but apparently no one got any training yet.
this place was disgusting.
i specifically stopped by here to get fresh and healthy food.
by was i wrong because there is nothing fresh about this place.
we ordered a chicken salad wrap, gyro wrap, falafel wrap, and hummus.
never going back.
their quarter wash is garbage.
the car looks exactly like it did when it was dirty.
you can get a much better car wash for the money elsewhere.
also the card reader didn't work.
not enough servers.
food was half hot and half cold.
there is a new menu with a substantial increase in prices.
we will not be back.
...not gay friendly...
we wanted to surprise one of my girlfriends for her b day.
discrimination at its finest.
they have ruined the menu.
the tapas happy hour is terrible.
no wonder there is no customers in the place at dinner hour.
i won't be back.
really awful customer service.
it was a saturday night and everyone wanted to watch the game.
the staff is not worried about taking care of their customers.
i was taken to dinner tonight for my birthday.
i wanted the prawns and they didn't have them.
we ordered the tuna salad and the tuna was well done and tasteless.
we ordered risotto and one was bland and the other too spicy.
we ordered grilled bread that was truly tasteless.
came here hoping for some good mexican food and was very disappointed.
i got the chicken quesadilla and the chicken was burnt.
i ordered a side of rice it was $2 and got about 2 bites.
it was way over priced.
flavor was very blan.
the service was extremely slow and horrible.
if i could give it no stars i would.
they market a birthday gift basket for uw students.
i ordered one.
i confirmed that the order was received.
it was never delivered.
now i get my credit card bill and i've been charged.
this place gives bosa a bad name.
beware: these guys have fake reviews on yelp.
went through drive through...
the donuts are stale and crumbly.
got my card back and drowned it in handisans.
wrote off the $5 spent and got the ___ outta there.
i have never been spoken to that way and for no reason.
avoid this foul, horrible place!
don't not hire them!
i specifically hired them for deep cleaning including outside windows.
i did not ask her to leave.
i tried multiple times to contact the owner and she would not respond.
i was extremely frustrated by my experience and will never hire them again.
be cautious of hiring cleaners from craigslist.
we were told the wait was 20mins.
we waited 1hr20mins before being seated.
groups were seated ahead of us despite asking three times to be seated.
i walked around a number of times and saw lots of free tables.
once seated it was overpriced and underwhelming food.
if i could no stars, i would.
i have my card decline, the money was taken from my card.
i had 2 different people tell me "come back tomorrow".
zahand's is fine, but their billing company is the worst.
beware before you sign the contract, i wish i listened to the other reviews.
fine, i paid it.
never before did they mention that.
of course, they magically don't have record that i even called.
yes, that's right, zahands can hurt your credit even if you do nothing wrong.
this place sucks so bad when it comes to service for breakfast.
mean while watching the lazy waitress talk to everyone waiting tables including the manager.
that was waiting on me not going back there.
i got better service at denney s.
don't waste your time calling them.
talked & texts about having some work done.
waited at home all day on a day off.
5:30pm they text they are too busy & want to reschedule.
told them it will be next week before i can get off work again.
never got any response.
run away from this company!
charged me $400 to replace my ac capacitor.
what a rip off!
the part only cost $50 at the most.
the place was pretty dead and they are obviously just hanging on...
very sad to see when flemings right next door is jam packed.
better food and some personality behind the bar would work wonders.
we would only return for the calamari and there is better elsewhere.
worst dry cleaning i've ever had done.
completely disrespectful and a horrible way to run a business.
would not recommend this place to anybody.
received a bill from pep boys that i was skeptical about.
took the bill to a different mechanic to have the work done.
very disappointed that they would serve lettuce line that and think it's acceptable.
not going back.
this is the 2nd time i've tried posting this review.
i also question the credentials of one of the workers.
how can you be licensed to preform services and you are having comprehension issues.
i did not enjoy my experience here.
some of the puzzles can be interesting, but definitely not worth paying 20$+ for.
purchased a certified accord from here.
within 6 months had to replace all 4 tires, front brakes and the battery.
recently both the rear view and side view camera stopped working.
this place is the worst, i would give it no stars if possible.
this is one of the slowest starbucks i have ever been to.
the only reason i go to this one is because it's close to work.
better yet- use the online app!
not really but what a strange, old, grungy dive of a casino.
we only came because of the living social deal and will never come back.
old school, hoopty and somewhere never to frequent at night for safety reasons.
i was nervous the whole time there.
living social should be ashamed of being associated with them.
first and last time i will be visiting this place.
came to this restaurant with high hopes given the yelp reviews i read.
left very disappointed.
the dishes are drenched in soy sauce and all taste very similar.
my moms dishes are better than these!
half order of french toast was cold and way over priced.
they were not particularly friendly either and i am a local.
we arrived, where seated and given water.......25 minutes later we left.
not once did anyone even speak to us, and it wasn't busy either.
btw wedge: it was my wife's birthday, thanks!
at this location the past three weeks, the coffee has been too weak.
the staff seems nice but when you leave and the coffee isn't right...ya know?
overpriced and horrible food.
they really must want everything to be horrible not just the service.
the customer service in this place is horrible.
update: 9/6/18 1:07 pm we decided to try again.
she said sorry when she opened the window.
the food was good and we were thankful to have gotten food this time.
poor service though.
bad service !!!...
last time ever dealing with this out fit !!!...
i wouldn't quite categorize this as bbq.
i should've known better when i could not even smell the food aroma.
if you are an avid eater of bbq save your time and money.
do not order online.
i ordered and got a confirmation email of my order.
too many other pizza places around to have bad service.
bye bye stumpy's !
i will go elsewhere!
this place is horrible!!!!!!
don't waste your time!
the overall experience was underwhelming.
i ordered the scallops entree for $24.
side salad was basic and the lettuce was near frozen.
scallops did not seem fresh.
the twice baked potato also did not seem to be freshly prepared.
my daughter ordered bbq beef tips off the kids' menu.
otherwise,  staff was nice, but would not recommend.
food is good but customer service was horrible.
they apologized and said there is absolutely nothing they can do..
they cannot reverse the transaction and they say it is just what it is.
the worst bar experience i've ever had.
such a bummer.
horrible customer service.
i've been waiting for a response for over a week.
my product did not fit and they are not making returning it easy.
i would never buy anything from this vendor ever again.
blackwell recovery is a fraudulent company that is affiliated or hired by well resort.
i spoke to several representative from both companies.
blackwell customer service agents are a joke,  "this is a professional call".
yeah right, frauds.
smashburger will not cook the burgers to order.
instead, they arrive medium well to well done.
would not recommend this place.
worst customer service ever!!!!!
if i could have given it no stars i would have!
my new apartment is only wired for centurylink.
i would give this company negative stars if i could.
the worse haircuts i've gotten.
the customer service here is so terrible.
this is the second time this has happened.
they are very rude at this location.
first of all we waited for 1 hour to get seated by our server.
to our disappointment burgers were just average and fries were awful.
we will stick to the tv show ....
abandon hope, all ye who enter here.
i have never had a good interaction with the staff here.
nothing is ever done in a timely manner.
my reservation was accepted and confirmed.
not a great feeling when you're about to run your first marathon.
hated this place.
apparently the only person that had keys was about 30 minutes late.
the appointment didn't go that great either.
the technitian  treated me like an idiot because i had questions...
gave them my info, car info, and gave them my husbands number to call.
so we shelled out the 200 dollars i was expecting about 190 with tax........
but i won't be returning.
food was terrible and the waitress was annoying.
i spent many years in italy and she was wrong.
also the food was either horribly prepared or it was frozen and microwaved.
i'm never going back!
hostess said there would be a 15-20 minute wait for my party of one.
five minutes before the female bartender asked what i wanted to drink.
and the folks in the lobby were still waiting.
business closed late 2017.
i ordered a cable box for my home cameras.
what's the point of reserving some in it they sell it anyways.
still waiting for a answer.
where are the points i've occurred over 6 years minus the $20.00 food voucher,?
no such thing as service at this place.
frustrating, if you want to dine for 5 hours, this is the place.
i'm not one to write reviews, but i had such a terrible experience here.
i've never had a cavity before, so 4 was quite the shock.
i declined filling and 6 months later went to a "real" dentist.
this dentist confirmed i didn't have a single cavity.
how the dc dental dentist could find 4 is beyond me.
you can find a better dentist, keep looking.
yet another terrible airport restaurant!
terrible, terrible, terrible.
all i wanted was a simple sandwich to go.
first, $8 for a simple turkey sandwich?
when i asked for it "to go" he put a lid on the plate.
how am i supposed to fit that in my luggage??
all i wanted was a subway style piece of paper!
told me to contact the manufacturer for repair.
my company has purchased product from this store for years.
i am taking my business to best buy.
waitress was great but the breakfast was awful.
eggs over easy were running and the hashbrowns were undercooked and cold.
bacon was good and so was the toast.
these people dont know how to work....
they should fire all the dumbass employees and hire people who need to work....
everytime i come here and get someting they always gotta fk somehing up....
every single damned time this place sucks dickkkkkk
it was awful..food -worse.
service- so so bad.
and now i'm never going back.
i don't even know where to start with this horrible unethical doctor.
i brought my son here because he was having seasonal allergies.
all of this they were able to decide without the help of the doctor.
my son has seasonal allergies not a rare disease only found in foreign counties.
i would not recommend.
the worst part is they were all standing within 10 feet of me.
each year has progressively gotten worse than the last.
not even for a die hard packer fan...
horrible horrible horrible
food arrived after a 40 min from ordering.
restaurant needs to need the reviews,this is a long history of happenings there.
will not return.
the guy says they are the company that funds the loan for title express.
claims they are the back office.
yea ok no thanks.
this place is seriously a joke show.
i don't even know where to begin.
just do yourself a favor and don't use them.
if you decide to, be aware and don't say i didn't warn you.
i've called human resources 5x with no answer each time and no call back.
horrible service to say the least!
worst rib i ever had.
have been to two smoke house in at.louis.
both use wood.
however, i guess they use charcoal instead of wood to cook.
the rib smells horrible and the color is black.
quality of the food is very low.
frozen beef patties, buns, fries and onion rings.
it's pretty rare that i post a yelp review.
service was very slow.
our waitress was nice and she could definitely tell that we were getting irritated.
i will never try this place again.
they seem to not care about customer service what-so-ever!
got up and left before ordering food.
won't return or recommend to anyone.
made a phone call to inquire about whether they have certain items in stock.
this would be relevant information if i were questioning the validity of his statement.
and i'm sorry if he answered 9 other people before me.
they double booked the same car in 5 minutes.
we ordered two sandwiches for pickup yesterday at around 5:30.
the employess were around 16 and lacking in customer service.
quite rude to us.
the bread was very hard perhaps it was leftover from friday.
i am so disappointed...will never go back to this location.
ordered carne asada fries and got no carne.
they wont even replace it.
all the cashier said was "my bad".
would not go back.
this is actually a zero star review!!
we ended up leaving.
sadly, we didn't get to try anything.
they should have a different system in place.
the signs were leaning up against the patio.
normally love this place for the desserts, but had to look elsewhere tonight.
never got to eat.
after an hour still no sushi.
hire a chef.
bummer, as i was starved and wanted to try this place.
try totos way better
why does this place close every day at 3 pm?
they claim to serve breakfast, lunch & dinner...who eats dinner before 3pm?
this company is awful.
three visits (1-2 hours late each time) and still no working ac.
i would not recommend this company to anybody for anything.
let me repeat that again, never use this company because they are useless.
we ordered a meal and ate outside with our friends.
and the soda dispenser wasn't working.
i couldn't believe it.
some customer service.
haven't been here since my college days over 20 years ago.
not the same place at all.
went to vegas for my 21st so i planned on drinking everything in sight.
not seeing if i was alright, just wanting me out of there.
would not recommend, go to gravady instead.
you want me to fix your damage with my insurance coverage?
i will never go back and would suggest you use another dealer for service.
food tasted good but i got food poisoning that night.
dont eat here!!!
i've been to two of these places.
this was the second location i went to.
forgot the bacon and over cooked the pizza.
it was chewy and burnt.
i cannot give my story, as it is way too long.
please listen to me.
never bring them here.
not very pleased with the new seating arrangements.
the couches are now facing the wall and allow optimal viewing of others eating.
not a good idea for business by any means.
i was expecting good things based upon the reviews.
however, it wasn't very good at all.
first of all, vthey need to take the word 'sushi' out of their name.
the other food selections were luke warm at best....
there are much better places to go in the area
of all the starbucks in the c-u area, this location is the absolute worst.
they are always slow as hell!
take some time to drive to the prospect location if you can!
i was very polite on the phone, it's truly unbelievable.
would never go back here.
worst gel nails i have ever had.
super rushed service and super expensive.
so many great places downtown.
save your money and don't go here!!
within 2 months our truck stop working, and we paid them over $2,000...
and did absolutely nothing to help me with the pain i was experiencing.
will not be going back there
i ordered a medium pizza and a dozen wings.
the pizza was very soggy in the middle roughly 50 % of the pizza.
the hot wings had way too much breading .
will never go back, should have gone to pizza hut.
this place looks way cooler in pictures but it's all a big head fake.
everyone that works there doesn't give a shit.
i've seen better pizza in hotel hallways the next morning.
i have had great personal experience with ashleys working with rocko.
i ended up calling her on it and cancelled it.
i really don't appreciate other people spending my money.
in my view this was very unprofessional and very sneaky.
it gave me the impression that she was just trying to increase her commission.
no one smiled or acknowledged we were there.
absolute worst kfc i have been to.
always out of something during busiest time.
secondly, no drink can be that sour with 4.5 ounces of liquor.
it tasted like pure lemon juice.
don't waste your money on drinks here.
this place is awful.
their lettuce for the salads is old and brown and their sandwiches taste stale.
there are so many other options in the area.
any of them are better than this place.
i have been in this store twice.
the man at the register didn't bother to say hi let alone smile.
it's 2015 after all.
sadly, i have to change my review.
the sushi is absolutely terrible.
they were not friendly either.
i will not be going back.
drivers are lazy and always in a hurry, they simply doesnt care!!!
close down your business if you dont know how to manage your employees!!!!!
if i could give less than a half star, i would.
this store is absolutely horrible.
employees here are ridiculously slow and have horrible attitudes.
if you can, don't go to this store.
seriously, you'll be disappointed.
absolutely terrible-- our entire party was joking at how bad it was.
i had the veal and couldn't finish it even though i was still hungry.
no one like anything.
worst customer service ever.
the clerk was very rude and would not help solve the problem.
just want me to spend more money on things i did not need.
unfortunately there isn't a "0" rating available on yelp.
terrible terrible terrible service starting with the hostess and ending with waiters.
delivery driver with a very bad attitude.
delivery from time of order was about an hour when eta was 15-20 minutes.
this time it all changed.
payed $60 for a superior interior and definitely received an inferior interior.
this applies to their heartland location as well as their burnhamthorpe/dundas one as well.
after my call was unanswered, i didn't even bother giving them my business.
usually, when i'm there, the customer service is ok.
there are usually only a handful of customers - if that.
poor, poor service.
no hostess for at least 5 minutes.
then get to a dirty bar to he told to wait another"5" minutes.
the cheese sauce for the fires was cold and the soda was hot.
new manager didnt know any of the simple info about certain pieces.
what does it take to have this guys call me back?
i left two messages and no call back.....what is up with that?
they are not taking new customers or something?
came in with some girlfriends relatively early to dance and have a good time.
needless to say, we left.
a simple order becomes a 10 minute wait.
whatever system they have at this location is not working.
this was my first time here...the food is tasteless.
also i was served water that had a oily film on the top.
my mom asked for extra garlic for her pasta and that wasn't provided either.
will not be back...worst food i've ever had
terrible customer service.
bought a mattress and box spring there.
guest services don't have their policies together.
the black lady said just tell them guest services have it.
i don't recommend coming here if you need to rent a wheel chair.
zero stars but was forced to give 1 star.
i have been here a few times before at mesa riverview.
something is just off with this place.
i am not going to critique every little thing about this place.
i think the visit this weekend was probably the last time well go back.
i think this was the 4th time we gave this place a chance.
what a joke of an office.
i scheduled my appt 1 week prior.
the front desk woman was rude and nonchalant about it all.
this is a huge inconvenience and highly unacceptable.
patients need to be seen and given advance notice of changes.
at least offer another doctor to accommodate.
i will not be a new patient here.
quite possibly the absolute worst rental experience ever!!
apparently this company is an institution run by the inmates!
saturday morning haircut.
there's a reason this place doesn't have any good reviews.
had the spaghetti and meatballs to go.
the taste was slightly below average.
tasted/looked like fast food pasta you can get at a foodcourt for 5.99.
paid 14.99 (us dollar) for a small pasta dish that tasted not so great.
wouldn't recommend for the price you pay.
bad bad bad service.....!!!
on valentines day...!!
tried to eat here for mother's day.
and saw many others leave as well.
lots of $$s to lose.
i have been to panera's across the country.
they are very good.
this facility is letting down the entire company.
disgraceful way to behave.
enough is enough.
the food is okay but the service is terrible.
i won't be coming back.
the service here was so bad.
my boyfriend had ants crawling around him.
the food was fine - nothing special but not bad.
the customer service at this salon is shameful.
i bought a package of car washes.
they scratched my car in two places.
fortunately i paid with my credit card,and it will be disputed, but.....buyer beware.
i don't think these people respect any one .
okay seriously, not a good buffet at all.
the service was excellent, but we will never return to this buffet.
way overpriced for nothing.
i even gave them 3 chances to get it right, it never happened.
i will be going to a different doctor from now on.
i hope dr pragit will move to another clinic.
the name should be "my doctor no"
and jen sias and the office manager are always busy to return a call.
i would definitely not recommend going to this walgreens location.
please don't waste your time coming here and go to another location.
the pharmacy staff is so rude and don't know how to smile.
the food is not equal to the price.
maybe guy fierri was asleep when he was here.
this property management company is to be avoided at all costs !!!!!
are they charging the owner more than what she pays?
just a thought.
the worst property management company ever.
i'm super angry over this and hope i don't get fired over a note.......
probably one of the worse establishments i've been to in a while.
nice atmosphere, but doesn't serve beer.
the employee would not even let us stay while the storm passed over.
i give him a 1/10 for friendliness as well.
visited at 550pm on a tuesday evening, the 12th of august 2014.
filthy bathrooms, dirty floors.
i would love to comment on how good/bad their food was, but i can't.
half of our group had left halfway through the second game too!
it was a slow night, not busy whatsoever.
over $2 really?
she is rude to us every time we go there, it's pretty ridiculous.
thanks for ruining our night for no reason.
funny how my negative review and other negative reviews got deleted from this.
do not shoot here, people are condescending jerks who treat customers like crap
i went to the ford dealer and received excellent service.
went there by myself tonight, was seated in a booth.
only 8 people were in there at 6:30.
waited 10 minutes and no one acknowledged that i was there.
don't know how the food is but i don't care.
the service is better at jack in the box.
they survived without me before and will continue on without me.
this place sucks for service.
hipsters don't have policies!!
this place drives me insane!
my apologies to the chef!
oh, and their coffee is awful.
i'm going to keep this short and sweet.
great food, terrible terrible terrible service and rude employees.
that is all i have to say about this place.
this safeway should be reported and closed down.
prices never seem correct and nothing is ever right on the recipe.
nothing else, no apology nothing.
so went in to build 2 computers.
this guy in the middle of talking gets a phone call and walks off.
what is it with this place.
we just left the full cart right in the isle and left
one person ahead of me, that had finished their  order and no other customers.
no acknowledgement when i came in the door.
waited while this customer just talked on about two minutes.
life storage opens at 9am.
it's 9:45 and they have this sign up.
the worst service i have ever experienced in my life!
never able to book an appointment when you call or email.
and if you want a refund because you are not getting any service?
i am now waiting for my refund...
this place is a scam!
beware of the old black dude.
however the quality of the food is just terrible.
who wants cold meat, rice and beans?
no one ever apologizes here.
i know i will get the service and food quality i pay for there.
all my experiences here have been horrible including their north las vegas location.
stay away !:
this place is a scam!
absolutely worst customer service i've ever experienced.
they owner is so rude and was yelling obscenities to me on the phone.
will be contacting the better business bureau on them.
they are so rude and don't know what customer service means.
i don't understand why i have came to this place more than once.
i guess because it's literally 1 minute from my job?
it's really unfortunate they can't even get a simple gel manicure done.
and an extra $15 to get gel on your feet?
i'd rather pay an extra $20 somewhere else.
bed bugs infested place.
rude front desk guy, no refund received.
stay away from this place.
service was horrible.
nothing special about the food.
the place looked ok.
i won't ever return to that restaurant chain.
what a joke !
i will never come back!
this place is sucks ..
i will never come here again poor customer service.
..manger is an ass hole i just had surgery.
don't come here again
horrible service, mediocre food that was barely warm.
they should have the option on 0 stars.
they are very unprofessional and rude.
i'll never go here again they give all beauty supple warehouse a bad name.
this location is in the venetian food court on the 2nd level canale shoppes.
the food here is far below the normal standard of pe.
never going there again.
u should have an option to give zero stars what a crap hole!
" no hi how r u nothing...
being asian i suppose i wasn't the rt type!??
i don't know what his malfunction was...
terrible staff and ownership!!!!
i work in hospitality and i've never been treated so badly.
these people have no clue how to treat their customers.
i don't recommend going there at all.
all 3 locations abruptly closed, phones turned off, signs saying closed.
when open did excellent car wash and detailing.
customer service non existant.
i returned an item and never got a refund as promised.
they kept saying it "was on the way" but it never arrived.
worst experience i have ever had with a department store.
not impressed at all and overpriced.
i would rather drive to matthews and go to mr. vape.
they have better prices and much better juice.
in particular, michael mcclure was a liar and a bully.
i will tell anyone who asks, and even those who dont, not use quicken.
this has to be a big day for all businesses in the mall.
you would think they expected this.
however, the restaurant didn't have "red sauce" to make a burrito.
instead of suggesting another item, i was told "sorry.
have a nice day." and dismissed.
there are too many other choices.
service was horrible took over 25 minutes to goer our food.
worst hotel i've ever been in.
internet is terrible.
don't stay here, service is lousy.
vendors like this are why home warranty vendors get a bad wrap.
this place is a cesspool and probably the worst mall in az.
crummy area, crummy mall, crummy people hanging out at the mall.
i worked there for a year and there were multiple arrests and gang activity.
it's just really disgusting.
dont use this company.
he was clearly ignoring us.
super disappointed in this experience.
i wouldn't recommend coming here.
with tony, i felt that i was an inconvenience and wasting his time.
i honestly felt worse about my self after seeing him.
this is a failure at all levels, not only with tony.
please do not give your money to this establishment.
(besides, they only take cash...)
i ordered the burrito and was very disappointed.
the guacamole in it was not fresh.
it was dark green starting to turn bad.
the tortilla chips on the side were hard and stale.
poor quality and overpriced.
my spouse chose this restaurant based on the high reviews.
we're vegan and he loves thai so it seemed perfect.
before seating us, the host decided to take a lengthy phone call.
i have no problem paying more for fine food.
after all, it's an experience.
but there is no excuse for that level of rudeness.
if i could give this place no stars i would.
i checked in for two nights at this horrible place.
however on my bank statement it shows 4 time!
i have never had an experience like this in my life!
stay away from this place.
you will have a better room and service at a motel 6!
projectile vomiting et al.
is that enough detail for you?
i hope so.
but it was a miserable 36 hours after eating here on jan 12, 2011.
and the food was not nearly tasty enough to be worth the misery.
zero stars would be more suitable for this place!
not worth the $23 i paid for it.
prices are constantly changing depending on who you are.
a girl in there had an argument with the owner because of differentiating prices.
i'm so tired of them taking advantage.
it shouldn't be that way!
would not recommend this place at all.
looking forward to having a nice coffee back home in melbourne.
waited for our food for 30 mins .
good food but horrific  service .
this is a walmart?
if it is, it's the walmart of walmarts.
so small, nothing in stock.
rude customer service.
some old guy even tried to grab my purse.
first time try the service and would not go back.
i've experienced better service!
fresh fish should not be $10 ayce at all.
don't ever go here.
i went to this location for a time sensitive lab test.
a seriously overpriced and way too pretentious b&b.
the staff was distant and not at all friendly.
we stayed there once and never, ever again.
i'm treated horribly and talk to you like if you know nothing.
they are rude and put you on hold when ever they feel like it.
super poor customer service.
constantly belittling her employees, in front of customers no less.
the food was horrible.
the price was ridiculous.
again this is not an exaggeration.
this is real.
save your money & your digestive system by skipping this place altogether.
warning comes before projectile vomiting & stomach cramps.
the bathroom situation was difficult at best.
all in all, i would not recommend this place to anyone.
not unless you really like bad service and bland tasting food.
they couldn't care less....
wow this place has gone downhill in the last few years.
the pepperoni bread sticks with queso dip were bland, bland, bland.
not even salt could save this dish.
the cocktail came in a standard drinking glass, no decoration and tasted like juice.
we left and went to white castle which was infinitely better.
pretty sketchy location.
can't trust this place...
don't believe the hype.
it wasn't cheap either.
the waitress apologized and went to the kitchen to have another order prepared.
look before you eat your meal at this restaurant!
lost part when they cleaned it up.
ordered wrong window and then sent wrong window to wrong shop.
run to any other company.
they will never touch my vehicles again.
prices are ok, quality is so-so, but the owner is the worst part.
want you shoes repaired quickly - prepare wait for 2 months.
please, people, save your time and money and skip this place.
this was the worse service of a restaurant i have ever had.
the waiter waited 20 minutes to take our order for drinks.
then he took another 15-20 minutes to refill my wife's glass of water.
the food once it came was not worth the price.
the temperature of the food was horrible and so was the waiter.
we will never eat here again!
it's also againt ebay policy.
i wouldn't waste your time or money with these guys.
my friend and i wanted to try this place since we had a groupon.
we decided to stop by after our pilates class.
groupon or no groupon, forget it, i will not be going there ever!
now i wonder if they even changed the oil.
the farm was beautiful, but the wait was definitely not worth it.
i might attempt to go back at another time, time will tell.
the total visit was $220.
these guys are out just to make a buck off of you.
i was told they had pool tables and it was a chill bar.
the security was rude and very unprofessional.
i asked to speak to the manager and he was very rude.
never will i go there again.
do not go here
after taking them off my sandwich some mysterious fell out.
i'm never ordering again.
save your money and stay away from this company!
there work is sloppy and they don't care about there customers.
also he never checked on us to see if we liked the food.
walmart no longer price matches other competitor prices.
good riddance walmart.
walmart is just a substandard retailer.
no wonder neighborhoods protest when one wants to locate in their area.
wood fire potential, but raw in the center.
they just don't know how to cook a pizza.
sauce and cheese poorly done.
this is desperation pizza, to be used only to sustain life if necessary
they need tofix their customer service because it makes them look bad.
i shouldn't have to check me bag every time i go there.
i arrive at top golf with 5 frienda, us all being 16.
after being greeted by numerous attractive females.
i get through the line after paying $12 for membership and the entry fee.
but i cannot swing a golf club with an adult.
thank top golf.
food was cold, and no taste.
servers had no clue what they were doing.
sitting around on phones while i need a drink refill.
never i'll order in this store again!!!!
the wait at this place is ridiculous.
this is getting ridiculous.
they are extremely slow.
had my catalytic converter replaced here 7 months ago.
well that's nice my vehicle doesn't even have an egr valve.
multiple internet searches even show the code i have is for a bad converter.
i would not use them again.
salmon doesn't taste fresh....
very pricey for the amount you got.
especially when poke guys (200m away) offers so much more and better seasoned.
if i could give negative star i would.
good luck getting your order right here.
i ordered a green tea hot.
just a simple tea bag in water.
i regret tipping them.
i've never been to this location and gotten a decent meal.
the chicken is always old or over-cooked.
do yourself a favor and avoid  this location.
this is a pretentious, discriminatory club if i've ever seen one.
the website, however, boasts free entry and free parking.
don't wast your time.
go to suite or label.
horrible horrible experience!
we placed our name on the list with the hostess phaedra.
she then walked away.
my husband and i walked away and will never return!!!
horrible and even the manager we spoke with was unapologetic
be careful when you go there because i was there two weeks ago.
use cash only!
whoever designed the flow should be jailed.
rude staff on top of horrendous lines
food was horrible.
i have never had to spit food out at the table before.
i ordered the beef cheek taco, the duck taco, and the fish taco.
i will definitely say it is the chef and not the ingredients.
the carne asada my husband had in his taco was rare.
all 3 of their salsas were bland and pretty tasteless and had no heat.
all around a bad dining experience...
i wont be back
this place doesn't even deserve one star for the awful service i received.
not one person apologized for the wait time and the food is mediocre.
never coming back again.
watch out people!
they will rape you and your insurance company.
i went in for a broken nose and came out $10,000 in debt!
i spoke to a human for a total of less than 5 minutes.
i was left in a room for 4.5 hours.
i would rather die than ever set foot in the hospital.
das is the worst type of shipping company you can deal with.
i absolutely would never use this company again.
filthiest movie theatre i've been to in a long time.
no staff to clean the theatre, seats with used 3d glasses and used cups.
washroom was filthy.
a blemish on your brand.
really enjoyed this restaurant in the past.
good food and good service.
went there tonight and sat on their patio with our dog.
only 3 other tables occupied.
so of the dumbest people working there...
their excuse is the company hasn't bought them a new $9 phone.
update to my review on master cleaners.
i can bring it in to you, being you are saying i am lying!
i probably will never attend here again until this ticket lines are organized.
strike 1: bad iced tea.
i'm very disappointed by the dinner i had last night.
the fried noodles lacked sauce and was very bland in flavor.
got a groupon deal for their laser treatments.
had been calling for 2 days, no answer, nothing, no call back.
got my money refunded...
many of them are sick.
it was very sad and i have never been back since.
should be called the beast.
i live quite far so coming back it's not an option.
while the other lady doing my pedicure "supposedly" clean and cut my nails.
not happy at all.
food was very bland and had little flavor.
the prices are high for the amount and quality received.
don't waste your time here for a healthy meal.
it's overpriced food breaks the bank and isn't that healthy in general.
also, food handling was very unsanitary.
no gloves on cooks!
bait and switch on the "honor competitors coupons".
try parking spot.
they "honor" coupons and take the coupon off the $7.95 rate.
shap refused to change this policy.
bye, bye shap
nice customer service but that's it.
worst fish and chips i have ever had.
and their pete's sauce sucks hard.
seriously please don't ever eat here.
i have stomach ache.
i paid 280$ and they didn't even fix my front breaks.
really disappointed i spent that much and didn't get my problem fix.
the current sunday morning supervisor has bad customer service.
nothing scream'n about mr. lee's screaming chicken burrito.
the people were nice, but nice doesn't make good food.
not a single one asked if we needed assistance.
we found the skate section, where an employee was helping another customer.
he walked right past us and never asked if we needed assistance.
the only reason we chose a speciality store was to get some sound advice.
nothing good about this place.
location is bad - you have to take two separate shuttles from the airport.
the place smells terrible and the furniture and counters are falling apart.
at least the driver of the second shuttle was nice.
i never heard from groupon and think these guys are full of it.
how do you lose your ability to drop off someone at the airport.
and where's my money?
i guess you get what you pay for.
some "deal" from groupon and lajolla express!
food was okay.
but the server was horrible.
leticia (sp?)  had brown thin hair.
she was rude, rolled her eyes and disregarded anything that we had to.
favorite part of the visit was the cannoli.
but, i will never go back due to her service.
after delaying the delivery, hanging up, i'm also called a lier.
this interaction that i have had with this restaurant is nothing less than comical.
i rarely review anything but this was so upsetting i had to do it.
the response i got shows exactly what it was  i dealt with.
like i said never again!
for years i paid for express service (grooming service between 1 and 1-1/2 hours).
bottom line is that they are extremely slow.
over priced and small portions.
clean and friendly but unfortunately i wouldn't recommend
ordered an iced tea.
i left, they have my money but i will never be back.
what a joke.
was fairly unhappy.
would most likely avoid this place again.
i called crooked river to place an order recently.
the employee named yolanda said that "we're closing in a half hour".
the very first words that came out of her mouth.
i asked if i could place an order to which she replied yes.
have had nothing but delays getting granite countertop from here.
keep pushing install date back.
when purchased from home depot was told it would be installed in 3-4 weeks.
now install date is set at 9 weeks from purchase date.
so sorry i dealt with them.
this is the worst service/customer service.
glad he didn't run over my foot!
neither rear door on the van would open and the hood wouldn't close.
i would not suggest doing business with these people.
these are probably the most bland tacos i've ever had in my life.
cold, and mostly resembles chewing cardboard.
absolutely no taste at all.
hardly any salsa so very dry also.
at 7 weeks i went back and picked it up still not repaired.
took it anyway.
poor customer service and no communication.
would give them 0 stars if possible .
horrible customer service .
and just out to steal your money .
20 minutes later we still don't have our food.
the lady seems irritated when i ask about our order.
so, order placed at 10:09 pm (not busy) and we left at 10:38.
we came at 7 pm on saturday of comic-con.
we were told out would be 10 minutes for a rabble of two.
25 minutes later, they claimed they'd called us and we'd never responded.
we were standing 10 feet from the host stand.
it was half stringy, preshredded lettuce, and half heart of a  iceberg left uncut.
i dread how the entree is going to come out.
this location had the worst service i have ever had!!
we were there for over 20 minutes trying to get this straightened out.
warm raw fish is unacceptable!
michael the cashier and george the server need to be fired!
michael does not know what the term "make it a meal means.
omg i wanted to kill him at this point.
what type of service is this???
literally lost my lunch, if you know what i mean.
this subway is horrible!
as always, they never have buffalo sauce.
don't recommend coming to this location.
consistently annoying during the mornings.
i have a better experience when i come at night.
would prefer mcdonald s.
djt had the second best tasting menu in vegas.
all the staff that remain, are jumping ship fairly soon.
now i'm really never coming back to trump lv.
i do not give 1 star reviews lightly, but this business is beyond unprofessional.
they said someone going to call you and never a call .
never again bmw ....
that has never happened to me at any other restaurant i've ever been to.
i did at least get my money back.
the service was terrible.
my cousin went in for her birthday.
they ordered starters which they got after the main course.
for a manager and owner to act this rude is appalling.
you get your own drinks.
no carving station.
do your research and spend your cold hard cash on a real buffet.
it's been 3 weeks since i first submitted feedback.
it's right across the las vegas premium outlets.
the only good thing about checking in here.
went through expedia and didn't realize i had book only one bed.
i tried to upgrade but the front desk are unhelpful.
not even a single try.
it's a no regardless.
the worst hotel service that i've come across in my whole entire life!!
never will i check in here again.f
i visited rumor in april of 2012 for their local industry night.
i stayed for a couple of hours and then closed my tab.
i spoke to the manager, but never heard back.
will never go back or recommend.
"thumbs" up on costumer service.
food allergies beware...
no salads are made fresh.
could not removed specified items from salad everything pre mixed.
for the cost one would believe that could make this request happen.
an absolute joke for so many reasons.
1) it took 4 months for them to ship my bridesmaid dress to ohio.
i would advise that all brides stay away from the wedding accessory superstore.
i'm still waiting while typing this and i still have a four car wait!!
i'm stuck and wasting too much time.
ordered online and got one of the worst biryanis i have ever had.
overall - waste of money.
at least the dish i ordered.
avoid this place if you can.
staffs attitude is good but can turn nasty if you have a complain.
they will start blaming you first before they even get the story straight.
people are way too generous with their stars!
someone said the plates are piping hot---duh...right out of the microwave!
would not go back here again.
extremely overpriced for the portion sizes, selection, and taste.
don't waste your money on this place.
piss poor service,especially if your not caucasian.
you don't deserve the star i had select.
the owner sells stale cigars and won't return them when you complain.
i will never go back to this place.
lee's liquor and discount liquor have way better pricing, selection and customer service
4 cars were pushed thru to waiting area, this mcdonalds is the worse .
then had to come out and asked what i had!
allegiant airlines is horrible.
i would suggest paying more money and getting a better experience.
if i could rate negative, i would.
i wish i could give it zero stars.
my steering wheel has huge scratches and gouges in the leather!
these people are so rude.
they charge a $200 deposit when just next door they only charge $100.
i will never rent from hertz again!!
i recommend just walking next door to enterprise!
we were paying $150 a month for cable with rates creeping up each year.
we are now paying $70 a month with directv.
you do the math.
that's a savings of, like, $25,000 a year or something.
when we asked cox if they could drop their rates, they said no.
when we later called to cancel, they literally hung up on us.
i'll never sign up with them again, no matter what.
their demise as a company is coming and it will be welcomed by millions.
suck it, cox.
liars....bought a suit from them and it kept ripping at the butt.
i also bought a sports jacket at same time.
i was told they would make any alterations for free at anytime.
they provide better service then mens warehouse.
when you sit out side it smells like poop.
smh i would never come back again.
why would make people sit out side if you know it smells like poop??
used to go here quite a bit during week and on the weekends.
the last couple of times it seems that the quality has gone down.
the biscuits were extremely hard.
i've been waiting to try this place for months.
especially because i've heard such good things about the ca location.
but man, this place is so expensive!!!!
$18.50 for a turkey sandwich, $8 for a cup of soup...
they have weird tortillas that resemble pizza crust but taste like cornmeal.
we both like hot but this was absurd!
super slow service for 10 o'clock at night.
our teenage son loves the food but i find it repulsive.
the bartender refused serve me by saying he had to change the keg.
waitress dumped dirty dishes from other people's table on the counter i was sitting.
the next day i sent an angry email to the owner.
how should i interpret this experience?
hard to review anything other than their "reservations" on open table.
it's kind of like call ahead."  we waited 40 minutes and then left.
unprofessional and really poor management.
the food is not good and the prices are high.
a soda is $4.99.
the prices are higher than a dinner house.
oh and if you only drink water they also charge $.75 for that.
definitely would not go back
i'm so disappointed i've never used 1800flowers before.
then the flowers arrive at 6pm, which is pretty late for a delivery.
i'm so disappointed and would not use them again!
you are in the wrong business my friend..
learn some people skills!!!!
service was exceedingly slow (more than twenty minutes between servings) and quality was lacking.
i went to the woman at the counter and explained what happened.
she tells me that the computer resets the cards every month?!!
i asked what does that mean?
why would my money that i just had last week be taken off?
when does the computer reset, because it is the 20th of the month today??
this should be illegal!
but the owner clearly doesn't know how to run a business.
instead of offering to resolve an issue, or pretending to even.
horrible service, rude staff.
i felt slightly racially profiled.
never coming back.
it's almost like they treat certain guests a bit more attentively.
nasty a$$ restaurant.
when you employ crackheads, i guess this is what you get.
clean your nasty restaurants glasses, hire people who can read, and start over.
its hard to pick a worse restaurant than this, avoid at all costs.
have been using veyo for a while, rotten service.
lately when i telephone they are having problems.
not reliable, sometimes have to wait close to an hour to get picked up
omg they must have changed the owner or chef or something.
the sashimi are so thin!!!
not recommended at all!!!!
wow this place sucks.
mediocre mexican food, overpriced, and they charge extra for standard items.
our second and last visit.
went in to have some things laminated.
no offer scissors or an alternative.
then he started pulling the gates over everything to close up (30 minutes early).
so, i decided i should probably go to kinkos instead and left.
this place sucks!
doctors won't listen what u say ,she just talking whatever she wants said!
it has been almost a week so i've decided to move on.
poor service, poor food quality, errors in the order, we won't be back.
out of business as of june 3, 2011!
these people are thieves.
well, legoland in toronto is a big flop.
it's about time that torontonians do not settle for being a gouge market.
it was also cold by the time it arrived.
i will never order from dominos again
would not recommend to anyone.
if i could give a no star i would.
worse place ever the service is awful.
they have no idea what they do and the times they open or close.
one of the more unpleasant customer service experiences i've had in the past year.
just bought a movie this morning around 1115am from an elderly cashier lady.
she was the only one working and was rude.
she needs an attitude adjustment.
never will come back.
i will tell all my friends to not go to that best buy.
would give zero stars if given the chance.
i was looking forward to splurge with a brat and cheese curds.
what i got was a big disappointment.
thr brat and curds were cold-cold curds=gross.
the sauerkraut was limp and tasteless.
even my soda was flat!
maybe you have to be drunk to enjoy the food here.
sure miss the brathaus!
food was bad, everything seemed stale or old.
$20 is way to steep per person for what they serve.
skip the disappointment and go somewhere else.
seriously not good at all.
and to top it off, the customer service was horrible.
i'm not sure how this place is still in business.
save your money.
the company advantage rent a car is terrible !!!
nothing but the crooks!
i will never ever use again !!!!!
this is the worst company ever!!!!!!!
i will never do business with them again.
stay away from this company!!!!!!!!!
i did not even want to give them one star.....
the spadina location was very unhelpful and unfriendly.
alanna then rudely turned me away.
there was no apology, no compensation, nothing.
very poorly managed, very disorganized and altogether an awful experience.
i will never return here.
i would much prefer soulcycle and their kind + helpful staff and great vibe.
i received a bill for $108.99 liars and thieves.
had a awful experience with the night shift workers.
they should try working at mcdonald's next time.
way to ruin a great burger spot in summerlin.
will be also contacting corporate asap.
pho burrito and thai seasoned french fries?
purple cabbage in my spring roll?
they weren't even served with peanut sauce.
i'm sorry but all the house sauces they have got to offer were disgusting.
unfortanitly this mcdonalds happens to be the one closest to my house.
for starters they are so insanely slow.
i cant number the amount of times ive been given stale french fries.
my burrito was deflated looking, like it was filled halfway.
it didn't even hold its shape.
it also had a really unpleasant aftertaste.
i didn't finish it in fear of food poisoning.
staff is always rude and disengaged.
i see they're short staffed.
the inside is filthy and they don't restock any of the utensils.
get it together, guys.
this location won't last the year.
i will never go back.
not the place for fast service.
took a while to get our order in.
seemed like take-out was faster than dining in.
service was terribly slow as there was only one person.
ordered a chicken salad, fresh rolls and vermicelli.
obviously can't comment on the food here.
slowest cup of coffee ever!!!
oh well, back to coffee bean for me!
just left there w dad n his friend.
restaurant was not crowded and took an hour for our food.
a steak that small does not take that long to cook.
this location has only been open a couple of weeks.
very unprofessional staff that was not knowledgeable.
i placed an order on a single part and they never called back.
i have been served better elsewhere and will not be going back anytime soon.
behind the building looks like a tornado hit....trash everywhere, just a complete disaster.
way over-priced for bread and coffee.
i drive 30 min every weekend to get bread from mon k.
very unprofessional, and they clearly dont care about their customers.
absolutely worthless for business.
no mobile deposits and their phone app is worthless.
customer service was horrible as well.
can't get call backs.
no interaction with them.
horrible lol , don't go here.
worst nail salon ever.
just left with all my nails in uneven shapes and lengths.
never going here again.
save yourself money and time by going to the rio instead.
the rio's about half the price and the line outside moves quicker.
this buffet was a massive let down.
i'm a local and brought my mom there for birthday.
$32 per person is fine when the food is good.
not the case.
servers were great but nothing could save the food :(
i ordered a two sliders since they are typically smaller and some fried pickles.
my fried pickles were completely saturated in grease, even leaving a small puddle.
needless to say i did not eat them.
the burger was good, but the fries were my favorite part.
probably would not go there again.
worst experience ever.
complained to management and they stood by this dishonest practice.
save yourself the grief and park somewhere else!
bad experience today.
loved the place.
told other people about it too.
we got up and left.
went somewhere else that had the game on, and spent our $$ there.
the ladies were super nice and the atmosphere is kid friendly.
the haircut is awful...
looks like something a kid would do themselves.
i'm not picky and still chose to go get it fixed the next day.
i would not recommend.
we've been here several times before and it's been pretty good.
they gave our table to someone else.
5 min later another single order came out wrong.
basically staggered food for a table of 4.
no manager came over and when we asked for the manager- she never showed.
waited 2 hours for a car i had reserved in advance.
no discount offered for the inconvenience.
very smug service
this gym is a joke.
we all live together and drive together.
we were just a family all going to the gym together.
ive never been so embarrassed and unwelcome at a gym in my life.
shame on you southside la fitness.
get over yourself!
worst parking situation ever.
after an hour, there was no such luck.
trying to get out of the mess was worse than getting into it.
don't even try to go in from flamingo.
park elsewhere and walk or use the monorail.
or wait until the parking structure is complete.
thanks for the wait time of 12 minutes in the drive thru line.
it is the worst etiquette to solicit a tip from a customer.
i book hotel here after reading the review.
anyway all the review are true.
dam it it was my bad to book this pc of sh1t hotel.
the carpet was wet and dirty.
ac is more like a cooler than ac.
there was a person cashing out and another person making some drinks.
no acknowledgment to tell me i'll be right there, so i decided to leave.
expect to wait a long time to get service.
waited 28 minutes in line to place my order.
now sitting here 29 minutes waiting for my drink.
only 1 worker on the register taking orders & 1 girl making drinks.
poor girls are trying so hard to keep up.
horrible management to allow such poor staffing.
here's a pic...counted 25 drinks waiting on the counter before me.
gonna be a long night waiting.
regardless of how this drink tastes...i know i won't be coming back.
waited over 1hr for food, with only a few customers in.
customer service beyond the basics is useless.
i'm going to a real company, even if i have to pay more.
the food looked good...if only they would have served me.
i wasn't even acknowledged at all.
walked in on a sunday night.
they wanted the last of the sisig, which was what i wanted.
i asked her if they had anymore sisig left and she didnt even respond.
walked out with a bad taste in my mouth and a lost appetite.
office personnel never pick up the phone.
you need to reach.
very frustrating when it's important to get in touch with someone.
not a quality establishment and most importantly they lost my clothes!
you get what you pay for.
worst customer service every!
went in because my phone stopped working.
my experience was very bad.
the lady did not honor any of my requests.
she did not even ask how i wanted my eyebrows to be shaped.
she did not even ask if it needed any further shaping.
overall very poor experience.
i'm still so confused about this place.
about 25-30% of the tables were empty.
nice furniture & reasonable prices but sales rep person @ mlk location suck.
wating 3 months for delivery of furniture
make long story short i got robbed here.
paid $10 on chicken inasal.
came out with "4 drumsticks" frozen, over cooked, dry, chicken marinated with ketchup??
it was disgusting and unpalatable.
please do not order the chicken inasal.
if i could rate it 0 stars i would.
called in a reservation and they didn't even remember it.
the service was horrible, slower than anything ever.
don't go you will be stuck for hours waiting on food.
a bit apocalyptic in this establishment ...
bag dispensers empty in the produce aisles...
produce definitely expired...
if you're looking to catch something...
i also heard them talking crap about customers via their radios.
management isn't any better .
they are completely disorganized and immediately get defensive when asking questions.
getting defensive over balloons and confetti is beyond me.
for a place that sells party items they are a bunch of party poopers.
the service sucked!!
the food was horrible.
spend your money elsewhere....
my son had the pizza which was soggy.
i had the lamb that taste so bland.
my husband liked the spicy jambalaya..
overall it sucked.
for $200.00 we could've had a decent meal elsewhere.
i so wish i could give no stars!
my experience was horrible!
i should've known better though.
all of my items are wrinkled and full of lint!
will not be returning!
save your money and garments and go somewhere else!
this place is a total joke.
now that i've eaten there i can confidently say its actually worse.
skip this place.
a total rip off.
the gym is huge, and they have good classes but billing sucks.
don't be stuck like i am.
no gluten free options.
according to the waitress, "the owner does not believe in gluten free".
so $10.75 for a small omelette.
waitress was snide.
hostess was rude.
absolute worst customer service!!
absolutely unacceptable service, not the first time either.
please do not waste your money here.
staff is not helpful.
told me i could return items if they didn't fit.
hopefully they will resolve this miscommunication amongst his employees.
because i go here quite alot.
this restaurant was suggested by friends  (from detroit!).
the drinks and service were good but the food was very disappointing.
additionally, the refried beans were pasty rosarita's out of a can!
i had a bad experience and won't be going back.
very poor customer service, was very behind schedule, and staff was very unprofessional.
i am extremely disappointed in choosing happy dental.
they never did.
this must not be that important to resolve!
i wish i could rate this place lower.
first time here and the associate was extremely rude in collecting my information.
will not be returning.
is there a negative star rating for yelp?
if so, the alley cat lounge, needs one for horrible service.
it took me about 20 min to get my drink.
the waiter is rude and unprofessional.
she gave me an attitude even i think she is a racist.
treat you like it is studio  54.
if you are not someone, don't expect to get on the roof on sat.
my children and i stopped in to purchase a series 2 watch.
we had to track someone down just to check in.
they didn't know when there were going to get more in.
when asked why we were all told to wait they had no response.
they just said to try online.
this is ridiculous customer service.
if it was great, no problem!!
then the word part...les than 5 minutes with the doctor!
terrible service honestly.
staff up if you know it's going to be busy!
let's see if the email for a free pizza ever shows up.
this place sucks.
service for drinks took about 25 minutes for each drink.
first time coming will, not come back.
dallas henderson had a better operation going on when he was the gm.
now they suck.
went here hoping for good things but was disappointed.
i ordered the halibut and it was overcooked and was very dry.
as well, the food is served in a plastic basket with plastic utensils.
not worth the money.
this is not wear/tear but an defect with the leather that is coming up.
never again will i buy anything from ashley furniture.
why the big difference?
the general manager at the store padded the cost of the part by 120%!!
however, i am not stupid and know how the business works.
so save yourself the time and money and go somewhere else!
this happens almost every time i come it especially the following.
i'm a platinum member,    why do they always do this.
this place is stuck in a past century - or a communist country!
the bureaucracy to just make a purchase is absurd.
customer service is non-existent.
this is my first and last time as a customer.
i don't think so.
they lost me as a customer - buyer beware!
every time i come to this ampm, an employee, monica, is rude as hell!!!!
couldn't even cut the pizza all the way through to the bottom.
i will never spend money at any ph franchise again!
would rate 0 stars if i could.
the secnond opinion took full x-rays and cleaned my teeth.
turns out, i do not have any cavities, except for one underneath a filling.
hoping that this would be a good place for our rehearsal dinner next year.
happy holidays all, sorry for sharing bad news but that was a horrible experience.
and i am damn sure never renting from this company ever again!!
spend the extra few dollars and go to enterprise.
it's less bullshit in the long run
i tried this location when it first opened.
the shawarma was pretty good, but kept falling apart the way it was filled.
the dips are good, but not the sandwiches.
there are no traditional fillings to add to the sandwiches.
i have been there 3x, but will never go back.
there is a much better shawarma place at markham rd & 14th avenue.
they make everything homemade & fresh.
this is probably the worst olive garden experience i ever had.
we waited for over 20 minutes with empty water cups and wrong order.
stayed hunger for over 30 mins and server never apologized for the bad service.
i would never return back.
i got the same thing when i asked for avocado.
instead of the shake i ordered i was given a vanilla shake.
can't rate lower than a 1.
0/10 would not wait again
very interesting little place.
service was meh but the food was even worse.
some of chicken i got did not look very edible.
i picked through it and only ate the vegetables.
will probably never go back
terrible  coffee and even worst the busy body owner thinks he owns this mall.
he also doesn't like dogs!!!!!!
it's yonge and st clair...everybody in the neighborhood owns a dog.
update, this location is closed.
apparently this location alone filed bankruptcy in 2013 and now finally closed.
gave excuse that previous customer didn't pay, than that their truck broke down.
could not have made a move more stressful.
do not use them!
i have an appt th but don't know if will continue there.
the dealer's name is reger
i rent from these guys every month and have never had a problem.
well, you lost a customer.
they get 1 star for low prices.
hair in the food.
crab leg jerky.
servers who hide.
an awful experience in all respects.
will not ever go back...
this is the worst place i've ever been to.
nothing but a bunch of rude ignorant people.
they try to sell you stuff you don't need.
went for an oil change which was a mistake.
they charged $ 100 for the oil change which is insane.
but the best part is they put the wrong oil in.
i took it back and they acted like they did no wrong.
then said well we will change it just in case.
stay away from this place.
next time i'll just do it myself
waited 25 minutes.
i will never shop there again.
i informed manager my business will go else where.
never mix johnnie walker with panda express = no bueno.
normally i would enjoy that mix but not this time.
all while: eugine y, johnny g, reid y were taking pics of me.
never again shall i eat this while intoxicated.
good luck if you decide to take your child there.
it's small so it wouldn't be noticeable.
i got nothing in return for their mistake and inconvenience, not even an apology.
worst chipotle customer service i've ever received!
she said she would talk to the waxer and get back to me...
they wanted it swept under the carpet.
the person came into our room while we were there and sleeping.
you would think that they would care- but they did not.
ordered a chicken pita through door dash, was the worst pita i've ever had.
just lettuce falling out of it.
pay attention to the mixed reviews here.
i had a pair of jeans and two suits hemmed here.
kim suggested i hem my pants for a skinny-leg look.
she hemmed the arms on one suit too short.
neither i, nor anyone i've had around the suit, smokes.
i will not be returning.
my wife had coffee here this morning and got violently ill.
stay away from this place if you value your health.
words of warning.
wish i could leave less than one star.
there's a complete lack of work ethic at this location.
this location will not do that.
sometimes going back internationally and never been seen again.
haven't gone back and would never recommend the place!
food was the average chili fare.
not even crepes.
our group has 5 different kinds, all said it was horrible tasting.
egg substitutes without flavor.
paris disappoints again.
this used to be my favorite neighborhood bar.
i'd come here for happy hour many times a week.
well today they changed the menu and happy hour.
and took off the half priced wings during football games.
i have been here for nearly every monday and thursday football games this season.
tonight will be my last.
good luck half moon.
i will never ever (did i say never?) come again.
even if the food was free.
bottom line is fuck this place and everyone in the front office!!!!!.
they will rip you off from your deposit.
they will claim damages that never existed.
they are thieves behind a fake attitude.
dont rent here!!!!
first impressions are everything...and ours was not favorable.
menu board in the entrance was odd and confusing.
person who finally helped  us figure it out was a welcome sight.
food arrived relatively quickly, but was barely warm.
best item was the black beans.
we are not likely to return anytime soon.
really not worth the money or time to go.
just don't go
food - we ordered and shared the sesame ice cream crepe.
oddly, they filled the crepe with cut up sponge cake ?!?!!!
man, what an awful experience.
the worst sns nails i have ever gotten.
i never write reviews but i had to write this one.
will not be back.
allegiant recently delayed my flight nine hours without informing me of any changes.
thanks allegiant air for being inconsiderate and unprofessional.
i will never fly with them again.
got my truck washed and it's been sitting for 30 min.
they still haven't touched the inside.
i'm just going to leave.
don't waste your time here.
no one even came up to us to ask us if we needed help.
i'm disappointed with their customer service.
gotta be the worse gas station ever.
i filled up only a half gallon and went to a quik trip.
wtf are they thinking here charging more to use credit and even debit.
what a joke!!!
i agree with the the past review of this place.
went to pick up my shirts and they weren't all there.
i never received an apology not once.
also they charged me for the cleaning after all this!
do not take your clothes here!
terrible store , customer service is the worst i have ever seen .
and the cashiers are very slow .
we at at el chorro this morning and we were very disappointed ...
the food was flavorless and overpriced.
it was nasty and did not spread.
$4 orange juices and $10.00 chicken tenders.
absolutely horrible experience for years...
i noticed that my internet is completely choppy...
spoke to billing who was quite rude and provided no resolution.
i am sorry i stayed with them and i'm glad i disconnected...
save yourself a lot of hassle and find a different internet and cable provider.
this location is dirty, smells, and has an interesting staff.
they were very unprofessional..
like the lady said "they need to get it together".
$300 for two mani-pedis..
we wanted to upgrade to shellac on our toes and they wanted $65 each?
they absolutely ruined my son's first birthday cake!!
very disappointed...we spent $40 and it was the worst $40...
i dont see this place staying opened for long...
i only give it a 1 star because of the wings..
good selection but be prepared to pay for their mistakes.
they stole my money once so i won't give them another opportunity.
absolutely, totally useless.
ask a question...
"i don't know"...
looking for something in particular...
"i don't know"...
"i don't know"...
why even bother working there...
why does this place exist?
went with high expectations from the great reviews online.
met with pretty disapointing customer service with a shitty haircut
the attitude of the bartender was terrible.
she needs a remedial trip to customer service school.
however, this female bartender was not, and i will not be returning.
we left, went across the street to bourbon jacks and it was great!
like night and day.
please note the soup it up!
location at the 20 bloor street east is now closed!
location map:  http://www.soupitup.com/locations/#map_top
employee nathena was loud and very unprofessional.
i would not recommend buying from this establishment or working for a poor management.
if you saw the mushrooms than why did you comp us the pepperoni??
if you like good service, you shouldn't go there because it's severely lacking!!!
scheduled an appointment online and appointment was confirmed via text.
groomer never showed up or called back.
myself and my 3 dogs are very disappointed.
peoples who gives high scores, are you ever tried anything better then carrot?
this place is terrible.
just look around, tables and chairs legs rusty, walls dirty need big cleaning.
their "famous"  burgers garbage!
meat 100% mixed with  soybean or just plain flour, very bad taste!
french fries just bad, fish and chips..
never ever tried  food same as in this place.
i visited the store and was very very disappointed.
5 servings trays were empty.
i must say that the veterinarians that i have dealt with seem fine.
my problem is with the office manager and business policies.
even if you have just applied frontline the day before.
they require that you bring it in and apply it in front of them.
they require that you prove that the frontline was purchased from a veterinarian.
however they always are out of products.
i want this store to work out but this was the last straw.
they constantly blow it for me and i'm about done trying.
don't waste your time or money.
plenty of better restaurants to select.
will never go back
i've had the same problem with this restaurant that others here have had.
i recommend driving down the street to tandoori times instead.
the food, service, and experience is infinitely better.
i am disappointed.
heard really good things about this business, but did not have a good experience.
took a chanel sandal to get fixed.
the sandal color is salmon, they fixed with white sewing thread.
to add, the threads were bulky and not delicate as it should've been.
i won't be back.
this place is a horrible employer.
they didn't pay an employee for over a month.
something very wrong going on with this store.
of course she canceled her reservation like the rest of us.
only complaint of my wedding by guests were the bartenders.
completely unprofessional and so rude to everyone including bridal party.
i could go into detail but i don't even want to waste my time.
wish i would have known how unprofessional they are.
save your money, use someone else.
fortunately, he wasn't in pain.
the cleveland va being rated so high is a joke.
this hospital is a dump and their employees dump on you.
if you have to call and place an order.....
i actually called him back to make sure.
i ordered fried chicken and it as nothing but fat and skin.
i am not satisfied with the customer service nor my empty stomach.
we came often to eat at midnight.
please manage or checking how they work and customer service.
there is so much potential really great looking but confusing.
drinks are bland food was okay.
live music was kind of boring for a friday night.
it's a great location.
they could use some direction and then they could make more money.
all around terrible service and their biscuits taste like summit county jail cake!
big store, lots of seating and staff, filthy.
i really hate stores, especially that serve food, that are filthy.
never ever ever ever ever hire these crooks!!!
i repeat they stole my ipod when i let them into my house.
i had to call the cops on them.
if i could it would be no stars...
they don't have restrooms inside which is stupid anyway.
extremely disappointed in the staff here at drais.
i will never step foot in this place again.
beautiful venue is the only good thing i can say about this place.
i tried to contact management but could not find any contact information.
regardless, i will not come back here again
$150.00 was the original payment.
by the time she left it cost her $329.00 a month for 60 months.
this place is the worst bunch of scam artists in the car business.
maybe they are working out some kinks from being new.
hopefully things will get better.
if not, i would add them to my indian restaurant reject list.
wishing them the best.
the floors are sticky and service is ridiculously slow.
polish boys and chicken were both subpar.
they tried to sell me a half a bong?!??!
amazon or infiniti's.
this places sucks!!!!!
spend your money elsewhere.
the cars are old and super basic.
they gave me a dirty car.
i had to request a car wash and it was still dirty.
the seats were stained and the car had been in an accident.
their cars look like the main companies sell them their used up cars.
they try to nickle and dime you for every little thing.
i would honestly give this property zero stars if i could.
i lost over $1300 of merchandise and marriott only wants to reimburse me $600.
i was a marriott platinum member but will now switch to hilton.
the "new management" is just as horrible as the last one.
i would stay anywhere but this hotel....
this place really sucks...
i bought a groupon for a massage..
what kind of business is this..
excellent concept with horrible support.
why waste 40 min if you are a professional?
if you are planning to learn basic bike repair here - go somewhere else.
this is the filthiest circle k i've ever seen!
especially for the location!
our usual one gets 5 star!
possibly the slowest business ever.
i can't even back out.
there is such a thing called multi tasking.
find a different smoothie shop!!!!!!!
this location doesn't honor internet coupons.
they are very "no can do" oriented..they don't budget on anything.
they always make a mistake.
they have no idea what customer service even is.
when i asked why i was told walk in customers were more important.
i'll never return to this location which is sad because it's in my area.
the most horrible restaurant i've ever been to.
i've been to so many sushi buffet.
they took all our sauce bowls and expecting us to leave.
we didn't even have  chopsticks because they took all of them.
the worst place ever in my whole life + food is not even good.
it's just average sushi buffet quality
don't buy anything from them.
they have three numbers posted on their website to contact them.
none of which anyone ever answers their phone.
i left several emails for them with no response.
i wasted over $65.00 for junk products.
don't waste your money with this company!
very bad experience on 7-30-2014.
took two interns for lunch at the cafe fiesta.
it was senior wednesday.
one third of tables occupied-30 minute wait.
told it was the kitchen staff.
computer system down and cannot use points-cash only.
online menu many more items than sit down menu.
$28.00 for meal-no senior discount with points.
last visit for me.
today the service was terrible.
i went in to pick up my phone order.
don't blame the customers for your incompetency, or for your soft-spoken voices.
they make mistakes on your credit card.
only a few breads worth $8.00, the average price of a loaf of bread.
i recommend that you save your time and money.
$22 for an over cooked burger and adult root beer at lunch, noon.
place is over priced.
mediocre service when it only had maybe 12 customers in there.
asked for burger medium rare, came out well done and over peppered.
ate half of it.
waste of money.
that's the whole point of going to little caesars, right?
you go in, give them $5 and walk right back out with a pizza.
it's really not worth waiting for, in my opinion.
normally we enjoy texas roadhouse.
unfortunately today must have been the wrong day to go.
we ordered two steaks and sides.
both where pretty flavorless ass well.
needless to say he wouldn't finish the salad.
the response from the waiter, oh sorry about that, have a nice day.....
absolutely terrible recent experience with progressive.
he has no registration, no insurance, bad driving history.
they do not investigate accidents!
don't trust them!
stay away of progressive!
bait and switch!!!
horrible, horrible customer service people.
check your bills everyone cause cox communications will screw you.
taking this to the fcc and media
cancel cancel and cancel...
then the dr.  should stay home and you receptionist shouldn't schedule anything .
they have me so upset.
i swear these reviews are fake as hell
you just lost a customer over $2.50 for some rice, great customer service!
i ordered the hakka noodles as a pick up order.
when i got home to my surprise they looked pretty mushy.
i tasted them and both the shrimp and noodles were over cooked.
the dish also taste very bland.
i'll stick with the original india garden down the road.
notice to all people!
this hotel have a 4 wow (worst of all worst) factor!
3rd wow - no internet, no soap, towel and remote control for the tv.
4th wow - reception name, mr roberto are totally useless.
this hotel totally disaster!!!
from guest: ireland
awful experience this week.
ordered the oregano's favorite salad.
a quarter of the salad was not edible.
disgusting, rancid lettuce.
how about what i had to endure?
not even an offer to remake the salad.
those people just don't care.
management needs a lesson in customer service.
will never return.
i've been a patient of dr dalley for several years without complaint.
however here lately their office is extremely difficult to reach.
servings here are small and the soup is bland.
this place is expensive, their food is ok, nothing special.
i wouldn't come here with my family.
they r just rip off
best buy isn't worth going to anymore.
now i see why they are going out of business.
never checked in!
when he took my plate away, expressed my concern.
they could at least offered me a dessert or something!
when i got to the lawn care isle they seemed to be out.
one star is too many.
it appears edge fitness is being purchased by fitnessfor$10, whatever that is.
will memberships now be $10?
i assume not.
the owner told me he doesn't know the wifi password.
we tried to order for delivery because we are 4 miles away.
on their menu it says $15 minimum.
we found that insane so never ordered.
this place sucks!
no sauna/steam room, no more racquetball courts, and no jacuzzi !
they downsized the pool area!
not sure how this company got high marks.
use someone else.
eastern and pebble.
every single time i go there and get my exact same drink.
my boyfriend and i always have a terrible experience when we go there.
i'm sure they would get better reviews.
my poor dog needed a summer cut and came out looking shaved!
i wish i had of read the reviews before going to this location.
thanks for taking 2 hours out of our birthday vacation for nothing.
the label of chinese food is misleading.
i cannot eat thai and some chnese due to chili and cayenne use.
i was stuck with an appetizer for dinner.
i had an awful experience with this location.
worst service ever.
sometimes the employees leave greasy finger prints on the bags/wrappers and the food itself.
i've given this salon numerous chances.
the lady at the front takes your jacket because she just wants your tips.
she is just so grumpy and doesn't really feel like being there.
the food and service was ok.
not worth the money.
there are so many other restaurants nearby.
i felt like this restaurant should be on restaurant impossible.
the wait staff was arguing w each other while the owner watched.
the only reason people come here because if its location not the food!
if you want good food don't come here!
they really need to work on their customer service.
very aloof staff!
if my very patient mother has to go "hello?
even then, she still wasn't acknowledged much less attended to.
i wonder if they even noticed.
they get an f for service!
only ice can rock cold not humans.
so sorry i did business with this dealership.
i am paying through the nose on this 2005 chevy uplander.
the absolute worst!!
rude managers- they don't even price match half the stuff they are supposed to.
avoid at all costs.
i would absolutely discourage anyone from becoming a patron here.
their prices are extremely inflated!
it was not surprising to pay 5x as much for an item.
i have no clue how this place is still in business.
not going there.
we got the steak nachos and the lobster and shrimp mac and cheese.
the food was okay.
i wouldn't come back.
most of them are poor so i really don't understand that.
oh did i  mention no bottomless coffee??
thats why i had to give him 1 out of 5 stars.
i've been waiting for 1.5 hours to check in.
signed my name on a piece of paper and was told to wait....
they've checked in 2 people in this time.
there are only 4 total people in here.
should have just gone to er...
would have had faster service.
please do yourself a huge favor and go somewhere else.
i had the most unpleasant dining experience at this place.
in the end we got so annoyed we just left without having any deserts.
not to mention that the food was not good either.
for the money we spent we could've had much better sushi.
the staff seems young, inexperienced, unprofessional and disinterested.
every cappuccino i've ordered here has come out as a bad lukewarm latte.
this actually happened.
it was a thursday and not a holiday.
worst place ever.
they refused us because they were closing in 35 minutes.
as we looked around we left quickly.
the place was dirty.
the people that were working there were not even italian.
and the pizza looked nasty.
dodged a bullet if feels like.
set up an appointment for 2pm.
i arrive at 1:55 and check in.
this is completely unacceptable and i will not be bringing my business back here.
i will very gladly take my business elsewhere.
so much for southern hospitality 
i bought a groupon for permanent eyeline.
i'm sure she just did not want to do any more groupon clients.
making an appointment thought her online system was also a challenge.
the pizza was okay...
it reminded me of like a slightly better little caesars.
hey it was cheap why am i really complaining.
i dined at noon on a weekday in the summer.
the most awkward note to eat ever.
service here is terrible, paired with the "ehh" food i do not recommend!
then more waiting back i the waiting room for billing...
wtf kind of outfit is this?!?!
everyone was nice, but at what cost...
i wish i could give less than 0 stars.
thankfully, we declined.
fortunately, it was cleared up the next day.
i can't believe this company is allowed to continue operating its business.
i had wallet last week in ocean beach, thanks for the understanding.
complete c.unt thanks for making a veteran feel at home.
do not use this outfit!
terrible customer service and cavalier with customer's time.
will not be going back.
one quickly left when he saw me reporting him.
evidently, it's amc policy that they don't search backpacks.
i picked up my order and drove off to the movies.
i get there and open the container.
i just paid $16.00 for fries!!!
and this is what i get?
have a good night" horrible experience.
we decided to try out this thai place due to high rating.
the food tastes decent, except for the soup was too sour.
they put too much msg in their food.
my body usually does not react easily to msg.
the amount of msg they put into the soup and curry must be insane.
will never come back.
i'm gonna call it gangster's shithole, but to you, it could be paradise.
overpriced drinks- i paid $8 for a bottle of beer.
could be yours.
wow this place sucks.
girlfriend got sick and the food was way overpriced.
food is good, not great, prices reasonable.
service on the other hand is horrible.
that was it.
the manager is just as bad.
this place is not good for crepes..
too doughy and thick.
the sweeter ones were better.
but they should just make pancakes, not crepes...
it is expensive also..
we got 2 crepes for 32.91 with tax.
i make better crepes myself.
went there for brazilian waxing from living social.
that was really bad experience.
she was very unfriendly but if it was the only minus.
the waxing was so painful that i couldn't imagine it could be so.
moreover the girl wasn't precise and didn't remove all the hair.
during the procedure she didn't say even a single word.
i would never recommend people go there for waxing.
watered down sales.
inside smells greasy....
waste of $$ and time
i never get on yelp, but i had to for this review.
this customer service is one of the worst i've ever had.
they do not have half of what's even on their menu at this location.
i would give zero stars if they let me.
hooters was established as a sports bar.
the casino in vegas is now a preppy bar that only plays music videos.
could not even watch the nba playoffs   stay away like it has the plague.
horrible slot olds and not sports.
lot of better places togo in vegas
this is absolutely the most disgusting place i've been in!!
floors are disgusting as well.
ew ew ew!!
won't be coming here again!
i love texas roadhouse but i'm so disappointed with my visit tonight.
it wasn't like they were so busy a table wasn't available.
you're open until 11pm!!!
someone failed at their job.
on top of that, no one came by to fill our beverages.
even after we asked no one came by.
the bucket of peanuts was empty and we had an empty ketchup bottle.
reserved a vehicle at this location and they ran out!
prepaid and all.
girl up front not very interested in helping.
i asked if they could call in and have someone help her?
got more sassy attitude and she spoke to me like i was not intelligent.
i guess im crazy.
left immediately and won't go back to a location that hires rude idiots.
the experience was awful and they should have more caring people handling our requests.
i will not adopt from them any longer either.
what happen to accepting stray for free or for a donation not a requirement.!!!!!!
do not waste your time or money!!!!
their attitudes are poor & very rude!!!
never again will i step foot in there!
that was my first & last time!
this used to be my favorite theater!
mr brendon make these jobs avalible again so theses lines are not as long.
worst company and customer service.
we had specific location and they had direction on exactly where to put it.
horrible customer service
not worth the money.
a store that doesn't supply the american flag smh.
but they'll put out christmas items in september.
25 dollars for a mens hair cut that's subpar?
it's on the same level in my book as great clips.
go somewhere else.
very rude receptionists (not all but some).
i've been coming here for years and it doesn't seem to have changed.
don't take it personally!
if i could give them 0 stars i would.
the poorest service ever.
my son flew out of las vegas airport last sunday.
they offered free waters to everyone.
well thank you you cheap nickel and dimeimg airlines.
and then in a few days a supervisor will call you back.
they are lucky no one died.
my first visit was good, i ordered a lamb burger, and it was tasty.
so i decided to go luxury this time.
i ordered a kobe burger, but it was such a turn down!!
the burger alone was $25.28 after tax (including $1 tips since it was takeout).
and it tasted just like a normal beef burger!!!
i have come to the conclusion that this starbucks hates me!
waited almost 30 min for 2 drinks...
my daughters drink came out 15 min after ordering.
still waiting for mine 10 min later...
i finally just asked for my money back!
they wait staff asked how my meal was...
i mentioned the above and the reply was .."sorry to hear that"..
food is bad, the guys making the tacos are even worse.
seriously stay away from this place unless you like bad service and shitty employees.
shitty service and not to mention dirty as hell and gross.
this location is consistent when it comes to rude employees.
my daughter has a membership and is forced to travel to other location .
guess they don't like cleaning the machine .
you're lucky if they get your order right.
you usually wait a half an hour or more to get the wrong order.
staff is rude at best
will never use again.
i had to clean after they left.
i have gone to  several pumps and the same problem occurs each time.
please do not bring your dogs to this salon!
they are negligent!!!!!!!!!
please spread the word so we can put these people out of business!!!
food was excellent and servers (sky and richard) were awesome!!!!!
the server informed us that the manager had to adjust the bill.
so rather than being rude and surf my email in front of my guest.
have been going to fredericks for 20 years.
the food is still ok.
but service progressively going downhill.
had a terrible experience last night at markham location.
waited almost an hour to get hour food.
everything there was chaos.the waiters were very rude.
it left us with a bitter experience.
they just lost a long time customer.
this place is not even remotely close to one of them.
there were bubbles, smudges etc.
someone else had to repolish my nails all over again.
i get it/ we were on the porch (though outside).
but we were not at the bar.
we are eating dinner.
totally ruined it.
found a white hair on my son's happy meal fries.
that is not okay.
they need to be more careful.
only two check out lanes open at a time...
this place is the worst walmart in all of arizona!
avoid this place if you can,  go to target next door!
stopped by for dinner and the are closed, with a new name.
sushi and sinaloa food :-(
fish sticks and fries.
that's what the new name should be.
joke that the call these square "fish" patties food
i order from here for lunch all the time.
i absolutely love their chipotle chicken sandwich with no avocado.
just don't order from here.
don't waste your money.
don't waste your time.
they are just ok dancers and really really rude .
he had a cold sore on his lip, and those are very contagious.
not sorry for writing this review, just watching out for future customers.
so ive ordered the delivery three times now.
same thing each time.
the combination egg noodle soup.
supposed to come with egg noodles, shrimp, and pork.
everytime ive ordered this, i've literally received 1 shrimp.
yea, one single shrimp.
probably wont order here anymore.
i sighed again this morning after waking up and looking myself in the mirror.
how bad it is?
just imagine your dog had its summer haircut at home.
i'm not saying the stylist is new or her skills level.
(she has a okay attitude actually.) i'm saying the management of this salon sucks.
how can a manager put a customer onto the chair before qualifying the stylist.
god bless two-face.
the food has been good but we won't be going back.
it gets quiet and uncomfortable while she's yelling.
the dining room gets a little quiet and it ruined our breakfast.
if going through the drivethrough i would check your order before leaving.
this bk cant get anything right!
the skin of the bagel is soft and not authentic.
coffee is horrible.
avoid this place if you know bagels.
really nice staff there, always with a hello/goodbye for the members.
(edit 18 months later)what a mistake!
stay away, go to planet fitness for $10 per month!
mountainside fitness will steal from your credit card long after you've canceled with them.
never going back there and warning others not to as they don't want bothered..
by looks of reviews everyone else agrees
joke of a company.
simple freon leak under warranty and they want to charge me $695 for labor.
i say to high and he says he'll check with his manager.
am i buying a new car?
comes back with a $475 charge.
will never call again!
just to find out they sold the club in store.
i am golfing this weekend and now frantically looking for another driver.
this review is specifically about the poker room.
above all else, the poker chips are downright disgusting.
why don't they ever get washed, you ask?
i couldn't tell you.
be prepared to pickup a disease or two with these poker chips.
best of luck.
this time the food was not even warm/lukewarm.
two thumbs down for me.
might try one of the other locations in the future :/
why are so many people in the construction industry such shysters?
then the super expensive doorway transitions were both different and wrong sizes and colors.
i bought my one cigar and cigar cutter and left.
i won't be back.
what a worst rent a car company!
after all, i paid $110 more including miscellaneous hidden costs.
don't throw away your precious money!!
i hate this place.
buffet's in vegas have all gone bad.
it used to be like 9.99 for breakfast.
how many freakin bacon and eggs can you eat for $90?
way too overpriced to justify.
let me start by saying this place has the most rude staff.
i'm so happy to be done with this company.
the absolute worst car rental experience ever.
would not recommend hertz to anyone.
they have no vehicles on their lot to choose from.
see ya hertz!
on my way to enterprise to solve my car rental problems!
worst service in the city.
almost like they couldn't be bothered !
seemed to have an attitude and answered (polite) questions almost combative.
the saving grace was the evening server that came in at 5.
food was edible.
how do you run a business without a phone.
their reservation system sucks.
great food....ok service...but really....answer your frigging phone.
really just isn't good.
the best place to get 25 dollars worth of food for 150 bucks.
i called and the girl ashely.
i think her name was...
payless car rental in phoenix sucks!!
never again payless.
less is exactly what you are!!!
do not use them...dishonest business practices
if i could give it a zero i would.
spent $110  on 6 plates that tasted like soggy cardboard.
also had to send a plate back as it was not fully cooked.
not even thai tea was good can i get a refund ?
why even give a star.
worst place to come to.
staff is very unprofessional.
but yet everyone that came in after you is seen.
the staff should be more courteous and people friendly.
instead of seeing you as a disease.
the waitress we had paid full attention to the men at the table only.
i used to like the old hlc for tasty, if expensive, canadian chinese food.
they're still kind of pricey, but the taste and quality is gone.
i settled for a replacement, when i should have insisted on a refund.
if i could give it no stars, i would.
what a mess.
how could anyone deem this acceptable?
the last time i went in employees were handling money and food.
isn't that against good sanitary practices?
i explained my situation and asked if someone could read the car code.
my husband and i just got in the car and left.
i went online and found that this is a standard practice by rrs.
this to me, is a fraudulent business practice.
i will never shop here again.
i cannot support a business with this kind of practice.
i got a cheese pizza and wings and the pizza was disgusting.
it was horrific.
the wings were really good, but i'd never order from here again.
terrible terrible pizza.
we ordered a cheese pizza.
the crust was limp and the pizza bottom not fully cooked.
if you want real italian pizza in the valley, you must go to bianco's.
if i could i would give it 0 stars.
wyndham cancelled my reservations without my knowledge.
now i'm out $60 bucks and staying in a not so great hotel.
the manager is a total jerk.
bashas down indian school is a far better option.
 no prices on some items.
so, cool, good thing i have my own in my office.
they make their own hours and are offended when you want something
i visited this schlotzsky's and ordered a garden salad and a philly cheesesteak sandwich.
the philly cheesesteak was cold and tasted fake.
i ended up vomiting immediately afterwards.
i personally would never recommend eating here and avoiding at all cost!!!
maybe if you drop acid before the performance it's awesome.
would not come back here because the food is extremely bland and dry.
had the southwest chicken sandwich.
the two "pieces" of bacon were bite size.
had a side of seasonal vegetables; this included broccoli, semi-steamed and again no seasoning.
my suggestion is to use salt or other seasonings.
maybe add some chipotle to the southwest chicken sandwich.
the one star is for the service that was top notch for a buffet.
the no stars are for the horrible food they serve.
i'm a local so i eat there with a comp from the sports book.
the salad at the salad bar tends to be on its last leg.
everything kinda looks like it's been sitting out for a long time.
food was ok, nothing to tell my friends about.
bought a indian biscuits little hearts.
it's just.89 cents.
would recommend not to buy anything from there.
playing with consumer health is just inhuman.
what world do we live in?
this event used to be an adult friendly eventnot anymore.
whom ever organizer this event this year is a con artist.
used to be a big fan not anymore:(
they need a better staff that can keep up with the busy pace.
this is the third time trying to call in a pie.
answer your phone!!!
they mess up every order and don't care.
management doesnt give a damn about your order
i called to ask for information and the receptionist was very rude.
i will not being going here nor will i recommend.
so my friend put a review that was informative and not malicious.
yelp don't censor reviews.
after reading the reviews below, i guess i went on an off day.
bun not fully steamed, hot dog warm, mccain frozen fries.......really?
montreal steamed hot dogs?
um, not in a million years!
save your hot dog money for a trip to montreal for the real thing
we were extremely disappointed because all the food was at the wrong temperature.
pay attention to your reciept!!!!!!
they charged me an extra $10.
not only that i tipped him.
i will never comeback here.
bring cash here, or else they'll tip themselves!!!!!!!!!!!!!
turned out that they didn't torque down any bolts!!!
you have to torque everything down.
stupid and incompetent
we come every years to this location for a work conference.
we had a couple friends check in right in front of us.
i replied no that's not gonna work and that's not our reservation.
the girl looked at me and walked away.
the bed didn't even have a fitted sheet on it.
i'm very disappointed with the service we got.
housekeeping was great!
terrible customer service.
what does this 20 year old kid know.
the rumors were true, this place is overpriced and has terrible service.
although i live 5 minutes away, i will not take my business there again
they forgot my 2/4 of my sauces and the chicken sandwich was ssssooo bad.
it was soggy and tasted like food poisoning.
guess i just need to give up micky ds altogether.
dried out luke warm fish sandwich.
bun was hard as a rock.
french fries cold and old.
coke all carbonation, very little syrup.
ladies bathroom was disgustingly filthy.
i asked questions and gave detailed information.
i asked a few times for a breakdown of pricing, which was ignored.
place sucks now.
the owner joe is a piece of work that fired dorothy the solid manager.
we miss your dorothy!
won't ever go back.
i would advise you do the same.
some people just don't get it.
the complex is loud and seems to be mismanaged.
sleep, security and safety is #1.
i noticed another parent on yelp that is not happy either....
her neighbors should have been evicted.
an absolute train wreck.
sadly my nails started chipping the next morning!
i spent $40 and i do a better job myself at home.
we also waited for so long!
the staffs in this loblaws are very unfriendly.
they ignore customers, give wrong information, and yell at customers.
it's always freezing here, bring a sweater.
wait time is really long.
hmmm what about drs orders?
every girl in there is not only older but they're 0 fun.
i would not go back to this place ever again if im in toronto
do not go through this property management company!
they are so unprofessional and they don't deserve to have anyone's business!
this starbucks is the worst!
i got "yeah it's right here".
i will never be back!
i walked into the store and felt very underwhelmed.
a few key chains, make up pallets, cards and books.
i hope they re-do it and bring clothes in.
so so so bad.
salad was brown.
kids' desserts were sad.
whole place was sad.
not gonna come back!!!
nevada healthcare needs to step it up a few notches.
highly priced mediocre food.
not coming back.
i didnt expect alot.
the food was gross.
even the little things like pulling the beard off mussels wasnt done..
they should shut this place down
this place gives very small portions of rice.
not highly recommended.
i can't believe the inconsistency between local stores.
rainbow no problem.
this location, what a joke.
obviously customer service isn't on the top of the list.
assistant manager and store managers just don't care and don't honor their word.
and to get different prices for the phone i was turning in, really!
i will never shop there again!
absolutely the worst buffet i have been to, despite the new management.
avoid at all costs!
i ordered the wild berry iced tea and mango...juice?
the result is it sucks!
the juice tastes sour and a little bitter.
i showed up at 6 and sign says they don't close till 7 .
she asked what i needed and i said a fill.
she spoke whatever language with the other lady and said we are closed .
but there sign was on.
they close at 6 everyone!
sometimes i go here for the heck of it.
but when i do its a mess.
prices aren't even consistent with what they have on signs.
there isnt much to choose from.
then i am out.
initial food was cold and tasteless.
server spenser was great.
overall very disappointing
don't be fooled by their fancy office, and their well-dressed receptionists.
they are a complete rip off...
they still owe me 1000
birkdale village shopping is a wonderful place to take a family.
good luck renting an apartment there.
i spent 15 minutes there without an eye glance at me or hello.
i was dressed presentably and understood they were with clients while i waited.
you had one job, lee's.
if i could give zero stars i would.
walmart caters to the lowest common denominator, and that includes employees and managers.
useless unhelpful idiots.
did i say useless unhelpful idiots?
i cannot express this enough.
worst customer service ever.
they will not greet you.
you will stand around forever waiting for help.
the checkout people treat you like a dmv worker.
what time zone is their phone system on???
this place sucks.
it's almost worth paying the higher price elsewhere just to feel human again.
i ordered a salad and soft drink from the pizza place.
they charge $4.50 for a soft drink.
no salad dressing was put in the takeout order.
skip this one, for $15 you get food worse than mcdonalds.
it was so disgusting!
i am very disappointed in this place.
we will never go back.
i just dont get it....no taste buds
dr. steinbrunner needs to take a patient/ doctor communication class.
be honest, explain treatment, results, possible risks and outcome.
how do you know a week later that i have a bad infection?
worst company ever!
now i sit and wait to see when it reaches me here in ok!
horrible customer service by brittany!
food was cold and just ok.
ordered 2liters when food arrived i got cans of soda.
i called and the lady only said sorry we out.
i explained i wanted 2liters since there was multiple people eating.
never offered to reimburse me.
won't ever order from here again.
same boat.....prepaid package for a suddenly empty store.
this place was so awful.
the husband and i had a layover in vegas.
for such high cost, i'd expect chipotle sized, but it was not at all.
we ordered a thai burrito and it was so disappointing.
the staff was not friendly and they charge for everything.
groupon went to waste.
non refundable ofcourse
it's not a bad place if you get seen.
hence my first complaint.
they yell at the staff and constantly make you feel like an inconvenience.
your best bet is to go to another shop or save your money.
the next day i went back and found the hotdogs still on the shelf.
i decided to go back to the store to see how they handled it.
all thy did was mark the price way down to sell it quicker.
they do not care about their customers' health, only their bottom dollar.
the service was attentive once the waitress arrived but that took quite a while.
closed for vacation?
there's gotta be a way to stay open and go out of town.
sundays come to mind.
these guys are complete crooks!!
was leaking transmission fluid , brought in to inspect.
i say do nothing i ll get my car!!
worst he would have to use a mirror.
they give me the run around trying to get my keys .
turns out to be a hose that was easily fixed  for about $150.
run away from this place!!!!!!!!!!
not a fan of this location.
i don't like seeing expired spinach still on the shelves.
cashiers are generally rude.
the venue itself is pretty nice...
oh so bad.
the food is horrible, like really really bad.
they failed to tell me that there are two different credit card charges.
taking my money out.
if you want to get cheated out of your money then go here.
each beer is $6.50 and a shot is $8.50..
you do the math.
and they tooked advantage of me because i had a credit card.
never coming here again!!
this place is horrible.
and the door is wide open letting heat in..
not smart in az.
then the water for my pedicure chair was ice cold..
the chair was broken and looked very dirty.
even hold my leg while she was going the massage.
failed smog test so took it here.
$300 later i drove out and noticed the engine light was still on.
took it back and it wasn't fixed.
spent another $392 to fix it for the ridiculous nv smog test.
expensive and spotty work.
i can't imagine the dealership costing more.
try to avoid this place.
we've ordered uber delivery twice and while the order comes quickly, it's often wrong.
tonight one person (who cannot eat shell fish) ordered chicken fried rice.
the food was otherwise ok.
greedy, cheap, careless.
absolute worst customer service ever.
then, when no one is home the don't leave a notice, or anything.
then, they just sit on the package for days.
then when you call, they just outright lie to you.
i ordered same day shipping, i had to cancel the order after 3 days.
dont try to get them on the phone..
their call lines automatically drop you in 5 minutes.
it's literally impossible to call them.
they also cannot be contacted at the airport..
requires you to drive o the airport just to talk to a representative.
wont fly them again due to their phone line system
if you are not a regular, do not go to this bar!
such as cheeseburger plain, cheeseburger no onions and a burger bbq sauce only.
the only thing they got correct was a strawberry shake.
i enjoy farmer boys and have always received quality service and food.
their rolls are very dry and bad.
they are expensive.
service is bad and slow.
their anticucho was pretty good, but other than that, everything was not good.
don't go here.
i wouldn't recommend this place.
used to come here all the time.
last few times,  it keep being worse.
custard at warm temperature.
not worth  $50.
less selection as well.
better go to wynn or encore if u going to buffet
the hash browns are gross.
they taste like they've been fried in old, burned, rotted oil.
poor management , bad service, employees poorly trained .
when you start to loose sales maybe you will figure it out.
there are a lot of choices i vote no at this point in time.
worst in madison!!!
if that's true, good for them!
this place was not good at all.
1) awful schawerma, only chicken, they don't even have beef schawerma!!!
2) absolutely flavourless!!!
typical westernized food.
3) who eats tzaziki with schawerma?!?
i asked for tahini and the response i get is  "extra $1.30!"...extra?!?!
tahini is a staple for schawerma!!!
i probably won't be back.
waitress named brittany didn't seem to care about anything!
would not return here.
watch your tap second time now they have padded my tab.
complain to management they don't care
well shortly after arriving here that was gone.
after waiting 15min the manager finely arrived and same from him.
it seems every time we ordered from here, things get a little worse.
it's a shame because i was so happy with the first order.
i don't recommend this place to anyone.
shame on you starbucks closing early when i waited in line.
you starbucks have terrible customer service.
the worst service in the industry.
expensive, old equipment, constant failures, terrible terrible terrible.
if yelp had - stars cox would be -5!
yes....they are cheap but you are getting cheap service.
worst hotel ever stayed at.
don't stay unless you're down in the dumps.
raggedy on all levels.
i'm still itching and hope i didn't bring bed bugs home.
smelled weed throughout the place and even outside.
would be zero stars.
this place smelled funny.
when we walked in the hostess and chef were acting very odd.
we were given a dirty menu...
i've been coming here for years, and today is the official last day.
i usually bring all three of our family's cars here for the platinum wash.
calling it a car wash is being generous.
i would call and complain but i am sure they don't care.
plus anyone i can keep from coming here!
you're the worst!!!!
it's  a  scoop  of  ice cream.
very unhappy with this place sadly.
the one thing i was excited about, miso soup, was gross!
i've never had bad miso till now.
the seaweed was clumped and weird colored, the soup itself had no flavor!
how is that possible?!
so we will not be going back to this place again.
better luck for others.
where do i start?
we decided to still try it and the food was not good at all.
not worth even 1 star..
worse experience ever.
service wasn't good.
overall just a bad experience and a very surprising considering it's the mgm.
french manicure was carelessly applied.
supposedly they close at 11pm ...
except they don't!
at least turn the sign off - or something!
stop wasting my time.
he's a large guy around 40 years old.
who is this guy?
i was a customer here.
we had a diabetic cat which had a severe seizure.
i called to bring in cat for immediate care.
i was advised that they were "all booked up" for the day.
this is 18 miles away!
this was not her fault.
i was shocked and very upset with them!
my dog went four days without her chemotherapy as promised.
roadrunner did not process my order for five days because of their oversight.
i called multiple times to get my dog's chemo.
shipping is advertised to be free and in three days.
my first and last experience!!
quite possibly the worst food i have ever had at a reputable restaurant.
some food was inedible salty and the veggies had no seasoning whatsoever.
don't rent from here.
go anywhere but this terrible place.
i had the worst mozzarella sticks of my life at road side pub.
$10+tax for 8 tiny flavour less bread crumbs.
and the savages brought salsa as dipping sauce instead of marinara or ranch!
not the place if you need help and want to ask questions.
that to me is not good customer service.
do not order take out here.
i recently ordered dinner for delivery, which was an absolute rip off.
here's a pic of what you get for $65.00.
do yourself a favor and go elsewhere.
i would never eat here again.
here after church for friends bday.
the wait time was not bad for a party of 6 and baby.
3 out of the 6 people enjoyed their meals.
i ordered a simple turkey club.
not a good experience.
i highly recommend you do not do business with zayne.
i rate 1 star solely because of that man.
it smelled like a dead fish.
i got up to my room and it smelled even worse.
i was disappointed to see the breakfast area closes 9am.
this is vegas people!
tried another floor and it was also missing.
customer service is not great at this hotel.
service nice there but the food is horrible .
the roll not like roll and not fresh .
not gonna go back again
this place was pretty bad.
i asked for a medium well piece and was given a rare steak.
at least the second time "sir" (as his name tag said) got it right.
even the drinks were bad.
stay away, even mcdonald's beats this place.
the worst experience with car rental company.
..if u could i was give them 0 syar
went in the store and never have we been treated so poorly.
the woman was rude and downright unhelpful.
on top of that, shelves were bare and atmosphere was awful.
the jack in the box on blue diamond/ dean martain is filthy inside.
there was a lot of spilled food all over the prep area floor.
not once, but twice i have had my tinted windows ruined here.
but quite frankly i don't see a difference.
i recently noticed this store on instagram.
i've gone in a couple of times and i've never bought anything.
a lot of the stuff is definitely over priced.
definitely take your business elsewhere.
this particular location is always slow, out of ingredients usually (like almonds and watermelon?
go to the store!).
this time the drive thru not working....
came here with my sister on the weekend.
my sister ordered the mushroom crepe and i had the chicken one.
seemed more like soggy chicken flavoured tofu.
won't be back.
while skimming through the other reviews, i see that the owner has a reputation.
comes with soup, salad and soda for $6.95.
it was just bleh and ok to my taste.
had an alright time until their scumbag security started hitting on my wife.
my wife felt sexually harassed and i left feeling insulted and pissed off.
they are scum and should be stripped of their jobs.
not coming back.
they have no free oil change for new car from them
see the other amex issues.
same situation....a small charge for $2.25.
never been to lush, didn't know it existed.
charge pre-dated an attempted charge for $3100 on klm royal dutch airlines.
thankfully amex caught and stopped that charge.
someone at lush is a conniving thief........
no matter how good the drink is.
i would never go back.
i tip the girl for a 4 drink didn't even say thank you.
such a bad service.
if i could give it no stars i would.
horrible quality of food.
it is overpriced to what you get.
i wouldn't feed it to my dogs.
sent my plate back due to old beans that had mould on it.
they claimed potatoe touched it.
i eat out very often and i would not recommend this to anyone.
i went to the mall with my wife, and there is not much there.
so many closed and abandoned stores.
not many stores left.
i would not normally be shopping here.
good thing i had leftovers at home to rely on!
never going back!
from the moment i walked into this place, i felt some off vibes.
the counselor i was set up with was awfully judgemental and made me uncomfortable.
she was prying too much into religious views and such.
just another one that doesnt get that not everyone is religous.
never returning here.
i can't believe anyone goes back to this place.
the staff was extremely rude.
i don't recommend.
i've been going to this practice for over a year now.
this is the second time they have charged my card without permission.
charges and overdraft fees because the money wasn't there.
i am done with this office!
i find that this popeye is a lot greasier than others in town.
the fat just leaks off.
i would recommend going to another popeye.
this chicken here is just disgusting.
the workers seem kind of confused.
check your order before you leave.
what are the chances?
add a touch of rudeness to boot.
small tight spaces.
really bad neighborhood.
homeless people stay in parts of the park after office hours.
they come in off the light rail to spend the night.
not a safe place.
staff very unhelpful.
there are better places to stay.
left after four loud nights.
police visited the park often.
do not come here.
they gave my debit card to the wrong person on a saturday night.
now i have to go until monday without any funds.
the staff was rude and unapologetic about the situation.
and another 10 minutes to bring the drinks.
definitely not coming here anymore.
the doctor seems like he just rolls out of bed and comes to work.
good thing i use a new doctor now.
don't waste your time people.
scam scam scam!
he spends most of the time promoting his dvd and resume.
my 15 year old son was in shock when the show finished.
"that's it?" he said.
what a joke.
that's what i told the tech, but he wouldn't listen.
don't go to m&i.
there are other clock repair people who are a lot more friendly.
btw i have had no (zero) fallout from my last treatment.
i am so annoyed at this place!
use to go here at least twice a month.
don't waste your time and money.
not only is the food cold and greasy, but also disgusting.
cook up a new plate instead.
will not be returning here.
i was super disappointed in the whole experience.
the wait staff was unfriendly and just didn't want to be there.
our sons food came out first and then 20 mins later ours arrived.
we ordered simple meals.
scrambled eggs, french toast and hash browns.
they do not answer their phone.
i've started filing complaints to amazon whenever ontrac doesn't release a package.
the more complaints i file, the worse it seems to get.
i was very lucky that no one stole them.
terrible salad, with limp old gross lettuce hidden in the middle.
not just one but two salads picked up for my gf and i.
not a nice experience to find out when starving on the plane flight...
i am surprised that starbucks takes advantage of travelers like this....
do not buy anything you are going to eat on the plane here...
stick to coffee....
very unprofessional and very rude.
the food was utterly disgusting.
disgusting worse i ever tried!
seriously this place is trying to scam people.
do not think they will honor your online reservation.
wave after wave of travelers make for long lines of grumpy customers by design.
don't feel like an idiot walking out when they try and shit on you.
there are other options.
if you're reading this post, you deserve to rent elsewhere.
https://www.yorkregion.com/news-story/8928068-stouffville-family-shocked-by-racist-attack/one drunk bartender and no one sober watching the place.
if they do, they will face a fine up to $15,000.
the food here is not good.
it is unbelievable how greasy it is.
i had a shawarma sandwich and the grease was just pouring out of it.
i also had the potatoes and they were swimming in grease.
also, the chicken is bland and does not taste good at all.
shawarma is supposed to be healthy not junk food.
i didnt find good hairdesser in canada yet and live hear 10 yeas already...
i do not recommend it at all!
advantage has gotten terrible since their merger with e-z.
total checkout time was more than 2 hours!
worst pedicure ever.
daughter went in for a special spa day and employee could have cared less.
hurried through pedicure even though there was no one waiting.
she couldn't wait to jump on her phone the second it was over.
i could have done a better job -with my eyes closed.
very disappointed and won't go back.
it's too bad since we don't treat ourselves very often.
how anyone can screw up a steak this bad i am not sure.
but our meat feast was not to be.
i mean really?
the rest of my crew were equally disappointed.
sorry eva, you're hot, but your food is not.
i am so disappointed with the pricing of gas here..
shame on you.
mr. walton would turnover in his grave if he knew how you were cheating.
worse here since only sit down (having wait staff) restaurant in the terminal.
i would still eat here if it wasn't for the staff though.
they are very slow, very very rude, and do not listen to their customers.
basically here the customer is always wrong.
including about where you want to sit.
tiny portions and bland food make this place not worth the price.
i miss the old middle eastern place at this location.
terribly over priced canned seafood served in an atmosphere of suffocating second hand smoke.
save your money and go to long john silvers!!
this gym sucks.
read the reviews and you can see for yourself.
not a single gentlemen working there.
ew you get what you paid for i guess.
some pieces were good most were horrible.
if you do go take a sweater they keep that place freezing.
worst rental agency at mccarran.
the employees need to have a productivity metric that they are measured by.
you can do this when there isn't a line zigzagging out into the lobby.
where's the manager??!!
shuttle line is terrible from terminal 3.
not enough buses.
horrible logistical management.
whoever manages this process should have been fired years ago.
closed for good.
lost their lease, building to be torn down.
closed, closed, closed, closed, clothes, clothes, clothes, clothes, clothes.!
smirked the entire time and looked like she was about to laugh any minute.
i went there for a special lunch with a friend.
we had a terrible experience.
the food was okay and the service subpar.
we will not be returning until the place changes hands.
we really liked it when it was palette.
i support local businesses, but will be taking my money elsewhere.
add this to the list of identically terrible experiences with this place.
attitudes were rude, don't say hello, making snarky comments to my wife.
waste of time and money, avoid at all costs.
this place is literally a dump!!!
it's a motel and my room was right by the pool.
i could hear everything outside and in all the rooms around me.
i immediately packed up and left.
this was easily the worst hotel experience of my life.
do not stay here
the customer service is absolutely awful.
the women working there are rude and are incredibly judgmental.
i will never buy anything from there because of this.
this place wish they had jeeps that nice.
poor customer service.
for a small business, they sure don't want more business!
your establishment isn't that phenomenal where i need to go back.
staff often as attentive as possible.
place often too loud.
obviously not interested in a quiet patron.
no reason to return.
not worth the extra cost and calories anymore.
for what ever reason this place has lost its mojo.
i have never bought anything here, but have walked through many times.
this is the dirtiest store.
all the carpets are stained and have holes.
nothing has been dusted.
i hope the general manager reads this and can help it look better!
just don't bother...pretty much anywhere is better!
this was the worst experience i have ever had at a restaurant.
i ordered a combination and the chicken came out raw.
i work in the restaurant industry.
food poisoning sucks.
obviously she doesn't care what the guest wants.
horrible tsa worker "freeman york" (that was on her name plate.
african american female tsa agent.
should be fired.
i travel 2x a week and she is the worst.
mean, angry, rude, etc.
rude to customers.
rude to staff.
my son went here for two school years.
it was because of her that we enrolled for a second year.
year two, the teachers were nothing like miss mary.
no warmth was seen towards the kids.
there was a definite separation of teachers and students, which makes me sad.
what a joke!
also, i had to get up and find another server to request dessert.
worst customer service ever.
the play area is covered in trash, tables not cleaned.
they wouldn't give me one and said it was $6.50 if i want it...
the store manager was extremely rude as well.
if you love kate spade just go buy it at nordstrom's.
avoid shopping here!
what a ridiculous way to run a business.
sorry to cut down on spreading germs.
will not be returning here.
scheduling staff was unfriendly and lacked compassion.
i will never come back to this location.
no pretentious millennial, my son didn't take anything.
this was a huge disappointment!!
bad food no flavor at all...
very disappointedand very expensive...
for cold  flavorless food.
think twice before ordering from here..
i've come here multiple times and it's always a crap experience.
anyways i only went here for convenience and never again.
solve it management/owners.
i am one of those "yelpers" when someone pisses me off!
see the date on this review?
this place is a joke.
if you get you're car towed here bad luck for you.
i wouldn't recommend any of there vehicle services either.
the pricing was very high for a plain waffle.
the food was served on paper plates with plastic utensils.
definitely not impressed with the service.
i would save your $20 and get breakfast elsewhere.
ordered chicken fingers and they were fried way too long and taste terrible.
seems like they.were fried in old/rancid oil.
got a full set and half of them are crooked.
my fingers weren't crooked when i walked.
get what you pay for.
won't be back.
as soon as they hear wedding or prom the price doubles.
really because you have a fancy dress you have to pay twice as much.
thankfully there are better businesses out there.
two cars behind us drove away with their orders.
i might as well keep it.
and i picked out a honda crosstour.
just lost the sale.
i'll get my crosstour elsewhere.
the finance guy was a arrogant tool.
great looking complex with grounds that are well kept.
however, i wouldn't recommend renting or buying here because of their ridiculous hoa rules.
you can't have a doot mat or certain colored curtains.
do yourself a favor and rent or buy somewhere else.
i will never make late night reservations here again.
i got the orange chicken.
kind of expensive for how bad the food was too.
it is fast food so at least be cheap and bad geez!!
found out that one extended warranty was refundable.
it has been over five weeks and no refund has arrived.
i shouldn't have to call to see if people are doing their job.
first and last time i visited here.
i was also a groupon customer which i saw a few complaints of below.
anyways i have never in my life tasted bad chicken alfredo until here.
absolutely horrible and my mom ordered the spaghetti and meatballs.
can honestly say chef boy r d is 100% better.
if this was the restaurant originally on charleston, we used to regularly eat there.
we stopped because we were told we didn't tip enough.
all the times we went there we always left a good tip.
this was in 2008.
it was last time we went.
shame on you.
no stars not only was my late pizza, wrong, & a fairly decent tip.
i sure long for my money pizza place in federal way, wa....pizza pizzazz.
the most attitude i've ever received from a cashier.
i will not be going to this location ever again.
the manager walked by twice and did not bother to stop.
the beaurocracy here is absurd.
i have nothing nice to say about their service.
took 30 minutes to get my order.
food quantity was small.
place felt dirty.
and the guy refused to give cups out for water.
avoid at all costs.
this place needs to be closed down totally, get fixed and then reopened.
i will never go there even for free.
strongly not recommended especially if you are going with large group.
dunkin ' donuts on lee rd.  open 24 hrs.
they need to close down.
donuts are hard.
i just don't understand how some of these places stay in business.
it's like eating plastic displace donuts.
the lady was trying to give me the hard donuts.
she wanted me to take extra ones to compensate for the hard ones.
well that was an understatement.
her reply "no.
if you aren't having a good day, don't take it out on customers.
do not eat here on monday nights.
they only open half their restaurant.
for that you get 1 star.
you are losing money by having that rule.
they didn't make one of three drinks right.
try to say something they get rude.
won't ever cone to this one again.
hostess said to come back in 10 min to get a table.
dont get me wrong ..
its good ...
but the fact they wont let u mix match wimgs is wack ...
zero for that one sucka ;)
it was not busy...big surprise
our yoga teacher brian just texted and checked his phone during class.
he's so not invested in this class#nahimanostay
i was so excited to come here and get food.
i heard great things about jewels and the reviews made this place look amazing.
we ended up throwing away the biscuits and gravy it was unedible!
i don't know why they call this buffet flavors, it actually what it lacks!!!!
save ur money the food has no taste!!!
and it no cheap.
good customer service but that it.
great food; the cod dish is phenomenal, as are the patatas bravas (sp?).
service was horrible.
there are far too many amazing restaurants to deal with shoddy service.
i've never had such poor customer service in my life.
the bartender's attitude is beyond rude.
won't be returning anytime soon.
don'tt do business with ruby nails.
i wanted to get up and leave.....but i had already payed.
worst chinese food i've ever had.
very unprofessional and horrible tasting food.
it's sad to see them losing a customer.
went there several months ago and haven't returned.
i ordered a bean burrito and husband ordered a taco (don't remember exact one).
the beans were ok but the tortilla was from a package.
the taco was better but not worth going back.
the only thing for us that was good was the service.
never ever go here.
i had two different tests done here.
this place is an absolute joke.
there are many other places in town, go there.
wish i had read the other yelp reviews of people with similar experiences.
wow, it took 30 min for 2 bubble teas on monday night!!!
people came after us got theirs way before ours.
the cashier didn't even say sorry for the slow service.
we saw few other people walked away also.
will never go back there again, this location is horrible.
food bland, service slow.
i'm done with beefs and will not be going back.
teakwoods is the place for excellent service and consistent quality foods.
total disappointment and will not be back
the quesadilla was whole wheat instead of white, which is fine.
better find another location.
i don't know how this place stays in business.
when i was finally served they had this attitude like i was annoying them.
the clientele is mainly obnoxious drunk frat boys looking for a fight.
first the waiter got my order, and the two tables around me orders wrong.
the customer service was ok, but the servers need learn to listen.
we won't be returning.
i'm very disappointed in petitti's garden center.
all i can think is they were not properly grafted.
they are a star rose brand.
no thank you.
i'll begin shopping at a nursery i can rely on.
i've been avoiding this place after hearing so many negative reviews and experiences.
over priced food, bad quality and bad service.
i will not be coming back here ever again.
they do not deliver after a certain time.
food was cold.
they were not apologetic at all.
barman finally emerged from the back.
we made eye contact.
got so irritated i left before the barman finally decided to come over.
really starting to loathe toronto's food 'scene'.
i wished that my lunch with my daughter was better but it wasn't.
first off just happen to look at the hh menu.
the waitress said oh, we don't have the oysters  bc they didn't come in.
uhh it was lunch.
ordered the "prime rib sliders" & bang bang lettuce cups.
maybe the cook had a hangover like one other review.
never will be back.
way too many other great places in chandler.
the pizza taste like ol' people had sex on top of it.
funny and disgusting, blah!
i didn't bother to stay for the food.
why would i?
i am in town for work--sometimes that happens.
so what was the real issue?
an absolute lack of manners, courtesy, or business sense!
their food didn't smell nearly good enough to deal with the rudeness & chauvinism.
we brought that up and asked them to please watch her closer.
they were closed at 7:05pm when online it said open 'till 9:00pm.
to say this ruined our night is an understatement.
don't dare go to this hell hole.
they ripped me off and the owner is a liar.
its been 6 months and my mouth is still in pain.
i have filed with the state board over my situation.
save yourself heartache and aggravation...
don't go here.
after five minutes i finally got to order.
saw all the good reviews on yelp and decided to try.
al pastor has no flavor.
chicago style fries are terrible.
i'll stick to tacos el gordos.
it's a sunday lunch and the place is not even busy.
very disappointed and will probably not come back again.
i thought it was just basic chinese food.
not too flavorful.
even the springrolls were just very bland.
the dumplings were too flourey with a tiny bit of filling.
nothing to brag about.
i wouldnt waste my money there.
don't expect much help from these guys.
i don't understand why anyone would eat here.
it's not italian food.
it's american crap that's one step below chef boyardee.
to be fair, the garlic bread is yummy
disappointing at best.
few ostriches and only one single booth out of hundreds that sold ostrich stuff.
the name should be changed to el gringo rippoff.
absolutely the worst fair i have ever been to.
waste of time and way too expensive for what you get.
our jasmine milk tea tasted like water with sugar.
what was i drinking?!
$900 in medical supplies and they don't give a crap.
and trying to get through to anyone is impossible!
it took an hour and 8 minutes to get through to a live person.
a total joke of a company.
the worst branch!
they are so understaffed here.
get a clue!
the only person who knows what they are doing is val.
this ulta is hands-down terrible.
customer service is non-existent compared to other stores like target.
if you have a large family, skip this place.
they refused to sell me 6 dozen donuts.
they were not friendly about it as well.
i'll take my business to donut worry in mesa.
they treated me like the appreciate a sale.
there hot pastrami tasted like they dumped a bottle of salt on it .
i went there because of reviews .
total money making  r i p!*********
he's a child.
they get sick sick.
don't get me wrong, i like taking your money but he's fine".
this is the worst shipping  company ever that i have ever dealt with.
we wanted a cork floor installed in one of our bedrooms.
their estimator came out and took measurements.
we then had to wait for two weeks until the material was received.
just another inept bunch of people doing a below average job.
they messed up my order and then asked me to come back.
i was already pissed cause the food gets cold instantly.
i get there and they wanted the old order.
i go there almost 3 times a week but after this...
it makes me wonder how they treat their customers.
update - 6/20/16.
office is officially closed.
it's been a nightmare.
my daughter starts allergy shots soon.
so far the office has been great to work with.
my experience at right toyota has been at most disappointing.
don't even get me started on the insulation issue.
dr. sabouri is a great dr.
i gave been a patient for glaucoma treatment.
i cancelled my appointment for july, manager refuses to return my phone calls.
dr. wellish, your reputation going down for $15.
don't waste you time or money.
slow service for a wednesday night.
fish and chips were horrible.
chips were old and cold.
was very clean.
and cute decor.
first and last time there.
it is my first time been here after they changed owner.
the nail technician skipped the base coat.
both then told me it didn't matter and the polish application continued.
i could have done this at home and gotten far better results.
i made a yelp account just to write this review.
well....pizzasuper pissed
not gonna happen...
i waited with my dad for about 20 minutes for two crepes.
definetely will not be going back.
for the most part, the staff here is very unpleasant.
bus boy was just plain rude and unintelligible.
hostess and wait staff seemed upset with life.
what ever happened to the "vegas experience?" still waiting for our food......
ok, so food was very good as usual for hash house.
but $1.00 for an iced tea refill?
even denny's doesn't charge for iced tea refills.
this was quite unsettling especially given the recent events that have been happening.
bring back canteen.
if there were zero stars, that's what the would get.
at 5:30 it still wasn't on so we left and went to pedalhaus..
which has cheaper and better margaritas anyways #bringbackcanteen
don't come here they fuck up my classes and scholarship...
fuck these guys and there bullshit process...
all they want is money money money...
financially sux ass here
customer service is terrible!
the lady she spoke to was so disrespectful and rude, i am so disappointed.
it's not okay.
service was so slow!
the dishes that were suppose to be warm were cold.
the quality was whatever there was nothing amazing or generally good about each dish.
plus a couple dishes i ordered never made it to the table.
won't be eating here again, disappointed and i'd discourage anyone from eating here.
we immediately showed them the problem.
they said they needed to talk to a manager but the manager wasn't available.........
i wouldn't recommend this place.
i was switched around 3 times.
i was here for over 3 hours.
the one lady who painted my nails did a shitty job.
this has to be the worst nail salon.
it's a total rip off.
i pay 60 dollars for this kind of service.
apparently they don't know what a reservation is!
oh well, dirty anyway!
very poor customer service.
i purchased an item online which is defective.
this is not what i would call good customer service.
today i learned to hate body shop.
ordered the special medium any way, buy 2 for $6.99 each.
sounded like a good deal.
not so much - undercooked, very little cheese.
nope  code not valid at either pizza hut at this location or near work.
won't be going back there again.
consistently disappointing mall with little reason to come.
the shops are all understocked and the food is all dirty.
don't bother with the this place and head to fairview or yorkdale instead.
went there for the first time for dinner.
seemed like we ate chillies with meat in it.
it was so spicy that i could taste anything.
all the dishes tasted the same to me.
not sure if i will go again.
sure enough...they charged me 26.00 for ????
cannot reach them...of course....i videotaped everything,  including time i turned it in.
ace -get ready to prove yourself.
honestly,  who has time for the bs?
so disgusted after coming here.
i will never come back here again.
worst slop i have ever eaten.
i have never had pizza this bad.
even the cheese tasted stale.
driest, most burned hockey puck of a burger i ever saw was from here.
finally, we didn't get a receipt - that's illegal in this country here!
don't go to this embarrassment to the franchise.
high speed internet is too slow to stream movies.
netflix and hbo now way too choppy to watch.
the dancers were extremely hot and the majority of them were so nice.
that is complete discrimination and shameful on the owner.
small portions and not that tasty honestly.
i really wanted to like this place..
dennys was the best restaurant when i was a teenager.
i stopped being a fan of dennys when i was 21.
it became something i rather not eat and just starve.
i just think your better off hitting up a drive thru instead.
excuse me but what the f**?
if i could give no stars i would.
a lot of "i don't knows".
front staff very very rude, unorganized and unprofessional.
i was very surprised because sante spa in mission is the exact opposite!
ok, it's olive garden so expectations weren't high to begin with...but...
my grandson wanted chicken alfredo and that's why we came here.
the hostess was surly.
i ordered the soup and salad which i've had many times at other locations.
the service was horrific got ignored by three servers and it was a mess.
confirmed food poisoning with positive salmonella culture test completed at medical clinic.
cross contamination is reasonable cause in food preparation and handling.
restaurant management sends cases to vultures to deny claims.
do not become the next case of salmonella bacteria infection.
stay out of whisky river at charlotte airport.
two wings would be considered one whole normal size wing imo.
what does she mean by that?
is it because my fianc isn't white?
what does she mean by not your kind.
ashley the member of management there is racist.
i didn't know people like this still existed.
would put negative stars.
terrible customer service and overpriced service.
lucky to have been given the single star out of obligation.
the "only car available" was a 2015 mustang with a v6...
$651 for 5 days.
full disclosure, i created this account to give this negative review.
they then switched chefs and now they are terrible.
but, i never ordered from them again.
also, their korean food has really gone downhill.
i would give negative stars for how awful this "management group" is.
don't even consider doing it.
dan the manager should be working at mcdonald's not at this place.
i would not recommend this place to anyone.
not to mention the place was filthy.
internet and sign on door say they open at 4.
don't know why.
seriously, don't give an unprofessional business like this your time or money.
go to an awesome place like fogo instead!
i made reservations three months ago.
extremely insensitive hotel policy, cannot recommend this incredibly money-hungry, profit-only concern business.
have found better consderations elsewhere.
it's the service that was lacking.
their excuse was that they ran out of chicken.
two of the eight reviews here so far are shills...
can you figure them out?
you've only been there four times?
i'm sure you've picked up more shifts than that.
to the other...
my 2 cents: run...
don't walk and don't ever look back.
update: shills are now being filtered, but not forgotten.
the prime rib was good but everything else was terrible.
i told him it was terrible and i would not be coming there again.
he did not seem to care and he said he would tell the chief.
this place is a rip off!
they were not willing to reduce the rate to $250.
we would never stay in this hotel again and don't recommend it to anyone.
not sure why people pay for this overpriced old disgusting food.
we had to try this place after all the hype it was getting.
yet again we pay for overpriced  and there's nothing they ever do.
im giving this cleaners a one.
in the meantime we are out of at least $800 worth of shoes.
my food( the sushi/sashimi combo) was just ok ....nothing to get excited about.
the service was exceptionally slow.
food wasn't any good.
the restroom is tiny.
i wouldn't recommend this for sure.
save yourself the time.
we spent over an hour here bc of how slow it was.
& if you're paying card you have to tip 15% or higher.
our dealer contacted this one to trade a vehicle.
when the drivers got there, islington told them they had sold the vehicle.
they have since contacted dealerrater to get the review removed.
i am posting here with proof of their threats to sue.
this dealer is not to be trusted.
this restaurant is by far the worst!!!!!
food was extremely greasy!!!
oil was left on the table from under the asada nachos plate!
$46 went straight to the trash as food was sooo nasty and greasy!!!
the most rudest staff and filthiest  facility i have ever laid eyes on.
not to mention they gossip and laugh about patients diagnosis.
we have have done this sort of thing before and really enjoyed it .
yes you right that right - 100% vegan.
why they are not totally up front about this i don't know ...
probably because they figure it would put people off.
the food was bland, boring and not worth even half what we paid.
plus we were still hungry afterwards.
such a disappointment.
the exterior (and interior) of a business is a reflection of the company.
it's a shame this place is in shambles.
is this place even open!?!?!
now i'm super annoyed.
one of my prescriptions was called in for the wrong dosage.
i kept checking with the pharmacy.
it has not been corrected, nor have i received a call back.
i've now been without the medicine for 4 days and it's making me sick.
that kind of treatment is absolutely ridiculous and is unacceptable.
i will not be coming here again.
stayed here again and i was very disappointed in this property.
tv didnt work....picture fuzzy.
our black rental car was just washed.
now its dried by the sun & filthy with water spots.
i can almost not look out of the windows.
we decided to return the car after 2 days & rent from another vender.
and we had no special pricing either.
wow was this bad, talk about bland and absolutely no flavor..
if you cant pass the cheese only pizza in ny style then fugetaboutit !!
in total, we waited almost a month for the service to be completed.
no apologies from them.
needless to say i will never use them.
i felt rushed.
i had very high out of pocket costs.
i do not recommend going to this clinic.
worst customer service experience i will never go back.
waiting time at the bar for drinks and food that never came.
i do not recommend it.
but all i experienced was bad customer service.
by far some of the worst customer service i've ever experienced with a jeweler.
if i could give them zero stars i would.
as a guest we shouldn't have to do anything.
i understand stand clean towels in exchange for the dirty ones.
never stay at this location or recommend this place to anyone!
we will never return.
was told this place was amazing and i will never return or recommend.
i am vegetarian so i ordered avocado curry with tofu.
so i basically spent money on food i trashed...
disappointed and angry...
do no go here for a good dinner experience...
it is dirty, smoky, run down, understaffed....
it is not worth the $18 per night.
the bartenders at wahoos are awesome.
however the management stinks.
they have gone through several managers and have made a lot of changes.
they took out golden tee and added slot machines.
they are also taking out the caseda seating on the patio.
i guess it's time to go to another bar.
where to start?
with the fact that there is no seating in the lobby?
how about the issue that they never answer the phone?
or maybe its the snotty way the counter folks treat customers?
we visited again about two weeks ago and again the gift card didn't work.
they will not honor them.
i even didn't  like the ham.
i never eat ham that was bloody and taste less.
country fried corn was horrible.
all in all the food was bland  and tasteless.
not my brightest idea to date.
uneven polish, jaded edges, just an overall bad job.
i actually regret not looking first before i came in, i'm disappointed.
i will definitely not be back and don't recommend this to anyone.
the seafood pasta was gross.
the lobster tails sat in this weird broth and looked disgusting.
she eventually walked back out.
today i go in and there's only one employee making about 7 subs.
i left for the 2nd time without a sandwich in hand.
i'll drive the extra 5 mins to buy sandwiches elsewhere from now on.
rooms were clean and reasonably priced.
not recommended if you want to get some sleep.
not recommended for families
i've had authentic smokehouse barbecue and this is not it !
i have actually been in touch with bbb and metro.
lunch here yesterday.
service was terrible and my friend was served her lunch without utensils.
she asked for utensils and the waitress left and did not return.
i got up and asked the hostess and she gave me attitude.
i didn't get what i ordered but ate it anyway.
the food was good.
the fly buzzing our table was not.
i'll never go here again.
we went for the first time and ordered appetizers, burrito, and an enchilada.
i don't think it's a kitchen, they just heat the food, nothing was fresh.
will never go back,
umm, an extra 100 for an alleged six hours?!
no way, steer as far clear as possible.
normally we love sns milkshakes but this location has been awful lately.
no more visits from us.
get a microwaved burger and microwaved fries with water for a mere $21.
doesn't come close to mcdonald's.
staff didn't not notice the ketchup was empty and splattering everyone.
they said that they've emailed me about the charges, that was a lie.
i didn't even see it in my spam.
i am so disappointed with my recent experience here.
you have lost my business for sure.
can i give negative stars to this place?
these people are rude!
it was as empty!!!!
well, we will definitely never be customers.
i was super disappointed after reading all the great reviews about the place.
stop here for our last dinner in vegas.
it alright if you want to eat fast and leave.
last week she called me to say her hair was constantly tangling.
poor customer service and bad hair!
don't waste your time because they don't care about you.
this was at the bar not the restaurant.
highly do not recommend.
phone calls always go to voicemail and messages are not returned.
stupid way to do business.
if i could give a half star i would.
horrible place for families.
screw up your order and then rude you when you call him on it.
try to cheat you.
and god for bid you pull out a coupon.
just say no to this wendy's.
instead of remodeling the building they should've remodeled their staff.
those poor employees.
they said it would be 1hr for 6 basic latex balloons.
terrible location & staff, they definitely don't want to make special occasions memorable.
came to this location for a quick run in and i regret it immensely.
decided to get a giant eagle card since my item was on sale.
this happened twice.
they won't ever see me here again.
three of us went to landry's for an early dinner upon arrival to vegas.
needless to say within about 45 minutes we were all sick.
we called the restaurant and told them what happened.
terrible return policies and unhelpful customer service.
hadn't even opened the books and they wouldn't give me a refund...
i ask how that makes any sense and she says nothing...
if you want to meet a rude cashier n  staff go visit this place.
food is very lame n tasteless .
i am from chicago and was in champaign for the weekend.
aren't they in the business of oil changes?
i even asked "did you put avocado in my salad?
" and she said yes.
and after i finished eating, i still can't find my avocado!
this is not the first time it happens!
not happy, to say the least.
i paid for a private room for my dog for five days, and grooming......
and he came back beaten and with a bruised elbow.
do not use this boarding facility under any circumstances.
this place is gross.
as if it had been cleaned.
the markings created were not wiped off/removed.
overall i would not recommend going here for anything.
dr. sakias it's very unprofessional and very cocky.
his staff was rude they left me in the room with no explanation.
also i supposed to have a prescription nobody ever called it in.
a doctor that can't read an mri disk .
this place is not bad but expensive.
we only go there because they carry an item we cannot get elsewhere.
they do take the belly card.
i have to file myself and sort it out with my own insurance.
very incompetent front desk.
i missed an afternoon at work because of that.
definitely a no go.
i'll be going elsewhere from now on.
ordered grilled onions on my burger and didn't even have any inside.
burger was falling apart.
never coming back.
charged me extra for all this bull shit for no reason.
between her and her client that i rent from nothing is ever accomplished.
i wouldnt work with a company that employs such people.
she is very unprofessional and does not follow through on anything!
the exhibition of the journal is at 6pm.....their reason for refusing to do it.
they are a christian-based company, and the journal had lesbian references in it.
do not support this company!
they are close-minded and unprofessional.
this is the second time this has happened.
what's the point of making an appointment?
i want to buy a ticket to a movie.
stupidunprofessionalghettopoor customer service
i don't believe reviews of private membership establishments should be included in your reviews.
thank you, mrs.
i generally love this place.
went in last night around 11pm with another friend.
3 woman bartenders.
maybe 30 people in this place.
no one even made eye contact with us.
the "new" manager was standing out when we left.
horrible customer service if you aren't a guy.
when we opened the food we found out it was the corn.
i took a bite but it was not good!
my friend ordered a crepe that was terrible as well.
safe to say we won't be returning.
i loved pizza hut as a child...
that ice cream bar...
is it the location?
this place is just poop.
the service,what the hut guys?
went here with family and they were far from closed (8:00 pm)...
all the young servers were playing around in the kitchen and ignoring the guests.
i notice we had to ask for hats which i usually never have too.
i explained to the waitress that my friend had never been.
the same thing happened to one of my friends, but she had 6 charges.
currently i have 2 incorrect charges that went through and another pending.
i'm beyond annoyed and will not recommend that anyone visit surrender.
first time here today.
food wasn't worth the price.
i'd rate 0 star if i could...
this place is awful!!
beds were not clean!
tv was broke and would not even turn on...
there was still trash in the trash cans....
used q-tips on the floor and window seals...wtf?
very unfriendly and rough employees.
the worst service ever ...
like: hurry up and go stupid tourist...
such unfriendly people shouldn't work in the service.
i just wasted my money on you guys.
people still go to this mall?
there are stores for those few people to even go to?
consider traveling a bit further to literally any other mall and you'll be fine.
i hung up and said i'll go else where
not really a fan at all.
and i like almost all mexican places.
i like a decent amount of sauce but they almost completely covered.
the barista was incapable of making a mocha or a hot chocolate.
i took it back twice and was still bitter and horrible.
my boyfriend's caramel macchiato was mixed poorly: all the caramel on the bottom.
they were also out of lids...
prices big, meals small.
been here many times for drinks and apps.
think that's what i'll stick to in the future.
mussels just okay, bread not toasted.
husbands meatloaf okay, mashed potatoes cold.
service just mediocre.
was told "i'll be there in a minute" three times by the bartender.
then someone (not the bartender) came and took my order...a pop tart and potstickers.
there aren't very many people here.
the bartender then came back and asked again what we ordered.
the food took forever.
for two basic things when not busy.
almost walked out.
if you want a refill on water, don't come here.
to take it a step further, the back-end of the business isn't much better.
i think my mom told me something about free stuff..........
this is the worst chase branch i have been to.
no wonder no one was there the two times i went.
both times, i was rejected service and asked for an appointment a week away.
i brought my passport, that's not enough form of an id?
their lazy ass excuse was that i needed two forms of id.
get your act straight manager and banker
i was so excited to try this pizza place.
i ordered a large pie with fresh garlic, bacon, onions and basil.
i also ordered 3 meatballs.
i then unveiled the meatballs.
3 quarter size meatballs rolling around the tin, freshly defrosted.
my teeth have been painful since.
he ground my teeth without asking.
this place is terrible they take forever!!!
don't ever come to this place especially at night.
the cookers are just chilling sounding like they're having a great time back there.
we've been waiting over 40 minutes just for our appetizer!!!!
this is ridiculous
because we were late for our reservation they wouldn't let us in.
people told us inside hat it had a bunch of empty tables inside.
found a bug in my salad halfway through eating it...
and not just a little fruit fly...
this was a huge crawling bug!
i was so disgusted.
thankfully, they said they would refund me but i will never be back.
if i could give this place a zero i would.
food is good only because of massive amountsof msg.
$1.00 more for shrimp?
put it on the menu!!
closes at 10:45.
wouldn't even let us place a to-go order.
call ahead if you're coming in late.
decided on a monday morning to try top golf in scottsdale.
they open at 9 am and don't take reservations.
i asked why the wait since i could clearly see many empty bays.
took about 20 minutes of complaining.
i love top golf but willl not go back to this facility.
this was the worst experience at a hotel i've had in a long time.
in the past, i've never had to pay for an upgrade for queen beds.
in this town service is everything and this service was terrible.
i will never go back to this location again.
the bald guy at the front desk is the definition of rude.
he is the single reason i will not be returning ever again.
service has went downhill recently.
don't waste your time unless you have a good 3 hours to spare.
management closes any time they wish.
she told him to get out.
this place is the worst!
don't rent or buy here!
if i could post no stars, i would!
takes forever to get your order.
bathrooms are disgusting.
oh, and they charged us for it.
overall a terrible experience.
check out reviews of their previous failed business:https://www.yelp.ca/biz/princess-nail-richmond-hill
me and my fianc use to come here all the time and loved it.
we left right away.
they either need to clean it up and close it down!
i'll never come to this location again.
ever ever ever!
the shrimp fried rice was not nice.
it consisted of mostly rice.
i found 2 peas and 1 carrot chunk in the whole thing.
one of the most horrendous experiences we have ever had.
this was about 30 minutes later.
cora is the best at bell toyota.
the employees are ridiculously rude.
and my latte was luke warm smfh.
i'm thinking of calling corporate.
every time every damn time there's an issue with this place.
good service, but really over priced for what you get.
i had a terrible experience at this location.
floors were dirty, equipment was extremely unorganized, and machines were broken.
i went here only because it was close to my home.
however, i didn't feel it was very professional.
if asking them to put me to sleep is asking too much.
the chicken is sinewy or rubbery depending on the dish.
sometimes it's invisible.
worst asian food i've ever had.
do not rent with them.
hidden insurance fee.
unpleasant and unprofessional attitude throughout.
poor cleanliness: exterior looked fine but interior smelled like cigarettes.
worst of all: found empty glass cup with straws and liquor still in it.
congratulations you've officially made car renting experience the worst.
used the drive thru last weekend.
not a good experience.
the guy taking the orders was not friendly.
i ordered the #4 combo and they only gave me three sauces.
i need 3 just for the pizza.
no fork, no napkins.
i will go to the one down the road from now on.
dirty, nasty and smelly.
i wouldn't recommend this park at all.
my kids were extremely disappointed and we left after 30 minutes.
i was surprised by all the garbage all over the place.
the smell of dog urine is overpowering that it gave me a headache.
we will never go back here!
will not come back and will make sure my friends don't either
horrible,unprofessional,and left us with no room.
i wouldn't feed this seafood to my cat.
nothing short of disgusting food.
i got sick within minutes after eating.
if you visit the rio, order room service or go to hash house.
don't let the pictures fool you, i found nothing fresh.
he stated that i needed the insurance.
he argued with me over and over.
this place is a rip off.
i was here with my family for a buffet lunch on sat.
the food was ok.
the desserts were a bit stale.
the jamuns were verybland.
this seems to be a technique that indian restaurants use these days.
please call ahead to confirm about cost of buffet for kids.
if you have a below average eater, it's $14.00 down the drain..
you are better off getting a breakfast burrito at mcdonalds ..
the place looks like nice and like it could be really really cool.
great outdoor area.
no class-a very inexperienced manager...no wonder it's not busy anymore.
sorry hanks-you were our go to place.........
complete rip off!
i signed up my mom who is 70 years old.
i opted for all minimum services in phone, internet and cable.
i received the first bill......$228.71!!
the epitome of bait & switch.
this is a very small club.
there are two bars, which suck equally.
$3 compulsory coat check and very unorganized.
nonetheless, i'll make sure to avoid this place in the future.
the person who answers the phone sounds rude, irritable, and annoyed.
he deserves the worst customer service award.
however after that experience, i won't be coming back.
being naive at the time, i told them to replace them.
it took 3 days to get me stock rims.
ended up spending $600 when it should have cost $300.
27 mins later he brings out my food.
my small fry was full but also old & over cooked and cold.
both burgers were also wrong.
i took my wife car for repairs due to swipe side collison.
they assign this girl mariah coordination of the repair.
i will never take any car there for body work that is just me.
be careful going to this location at night.
it definitely did not belong to me.
the cook even leaned in to wonder what happened and he "seemed" shocked.
wont go to that location ever again.
take my advise or find it for yourself
by far the worst airlines ever!!!!!!!
how are they still in business?????
they just delayed my flight an entire day!!
this company should be sued and burned in hell!
today is the last day i will ever visit arbys.
plastic inside my sandwich.
chicken was burnt.
sandwich looks like it was thrown across the room.
i still have no idea what that black thing is inside my sandwich.
i feel like i've been poisoned.
what is this horrible chicken sandwich?
i'd definitely like to add more info to discourage anyone to rent here.
0 stars, i had to give it one to post a review
this was our second time ordering from mirch masala.
the first time, order was correct and we had no issues.
lastly, the vegetable samosas were raw on the inside.
i have pics to share.
not sure how to on yelp.
i have never seen business with more erratic hours than this place.
that's 30 hours a week!
that's not enough to even consider it a full time job!
there won't be a third try.
the staff seemed uninterested and disingenuous.
really just a pretentious vibe and a slack-effort staff.
the food was that of any other gentrified restaurant popping-up in arcadia.
best part about this place was leaving.
they use pre-cooked eggs.
are you kidding me?
local shops are supposed to be better than chains, right?
how hard is it to cook an egg?
this pizza is really good for its price.
however this location is dirty.
on the menu.
at least clean it up so the customers don't see it.
now i know why the pizza was so good.
is there a way to give this bag of fail negative stars?
none of the other isps i have used had such garbage service.
biggest waste of money on the planet.
do not use cox under any circumstances!
prices are great but seriously, the quality is poor.
you can find better quality used furniture.
my mom has chairs from before i was born.
these things are eye candy but they show no promise of long life.
may be used, but i can bet they'll be much higher quality.
i'll spend the difference having items refurbished to look like new once again.
the waiter just plopped the water pitcher down and quickly walked away.
not once did a waiter or waitress ask if we needed more water, etc.
on the plus side though, the food was pretty good.
my family enjoyed the choi sum, chow fun with beef and the fried calamari.
it's too bad the horrible service outweighed the tasty food.
highly unlikely we'll ever dine here again on our next visit to las vegas.
this store closed about 2 years ago.
this place was a huge disappointment!
we were told we could check in early around 12....
our rooms were not ready until 5!!!!
this place is a joke!
do not waste your money here!
i have never written a negative review before but bertolucci's brazilian steakhouse deserves it.
the service was extremely slow, food selection was very limited and boring.
bertolucci's was a big disappointment.
they add an 18% gratuity to your bill that they don't deserve.
not worth your time money.
this place is a ripoff!
the doctor left for the day.
she said we have to be there at 6 for the 6:30 apt.
so we end up rescheduling and wasted a trip to their store for nothing.
the one star is for the pleasant and helpful staff.
everything else was super low rent.
the pictures posted on yelp explain everything you can expect from staying here.
rude staff and confusing ordering process.
is this just a milkshake place?
this takes up most of the sign on the wall.
the girl working behind the counter couldn't be bothered to answer our questions.
we felt so uncomfortable, we walked out.
coldstone = friendly staff and easy to follow menu.
worst massage of my life.
the curtains didnt cover the entire door frame and it felt very uncomfortable.
not relaxing at all.
even the receptionist said "ok you tip now".
if the service sucks im not tipping.
i gave her a few bucks just to get her away from me.
it's easy to see why this mcdonald's is rated terribly .
the girl taking the orders clearly hates her job .
just nasty .
i will never return to this location .
i strongly recommend that you do not hire college movers.
we attempted to hire college movers to move a three bedroom row house.
they told us not to worry that they would get a crew.
definition of a roach motel with cockroaches working behind the front desk.
i say save the money and level it.
this place is disgusting and stinks!
worse than the worst motel 6 on the planet!
employees are such jerks too.
the hostess was the only good thing about this place.
the service was slower than maple syrup in january.
while my breakfast was a bit better it was nothing special.
this was second time we have gone and been unimpressed!!
great customer service.
i guess we need to find a new place!!
this place has the worst customer service i have ever experienced.
i guess making money is more important than safety or good service.
this place needs to replace the management.
arriving to check in the lobby and bar area was great.
they spend a lot of time hyping the place up as far as presentation.
and the lobby looked just like the pictures posted.
i was referred to payless via dunhill travel.
loved the rate since i only need rental for 2 days in las vegas.
did not read reviews and wished i had.
i will complete my review after i return the car.
stopped by here on 6/10/12 and had a bad experience.
i ordered the island breakfast plate with the portuguese sausage, eggs and rice.
the hash browns came out looking like they were a frozen product.
we got more service from the guy busing tables.
it'll be a while before i return.
not the greatest place, i wouldn't get anything from them again.
it's not worthy of a one star rating.
seemed like they were very short handed, only two people working.
stay far far away!!!
this company, once a lease is signed, they give zero s$&@s about you.
we are now looking into legal action.
they move the speed of a sloth.
so i just took it.
i will be looking elsewhere to get my cars washed.
she said "yes" ...
we left and so did the other two ladies.
this place doesnt want or evidently need business
she acted as if we were bothering her, news flash..
your job is customer service.
defiantly won't be coming back.
this place came highly recommended, and with a 4-plus star rating.
i'm not sure why.
the bartender was abrupt and uninterested, but i was hungry.
i ordered the chicken pesto flatbread and was very disappointed.
that and a soda cost $19!
this is not for families with children.
had an interesting experience with a particularly hateful employee with my kids today.
screaming at children is not okay.
then they were walking fast and he screamed at them again.
if you're an adult then go.
but i'll never go again even without my children.
even a one star is not acceptable for this company.
i told him shut the cable off now.
i had to literally get mean about it.
this company should be sued for their practices.
this place has gone down hill and shows no signs of coming back up.
first an last time coming to this only location in nv.
friendly staff but they really need a atm at this location !
this place is gross.
the mattress are just springs.
they are super dirty.
the staff is horrible and they don't actually have breakfast at all.
literal blood stains on the sheets it was beyond gross.
worst coffee at the airport!
taste like it was made yesterday,
review is solely for the food.
i ordered the pretzel bites with beer cheese and it was horrible.
the pretzel was obviously warmed up in the microwave and tasted a week old.
i will not be going back for any type of food.
wait staff so super awesome and friendly.
if you want a good pretzel and beer cheese, head to old mecklenburg  brewery.
terrible food,  terrible service, just plain terrible.
i would have complained if someone had checked on us period.
you eat off of paper plates!
food is below average and customer service is non existent.
this was a terrible experience.
the waitress was very nice and have no complaints about her.
however, the food, was just awful.
why do people go there?
we had a gift card and that's the only reason.
of course, we forgot the gift card...but ya know what?
we aren't going to go back to use it because it was that bad.
i really don't understand why anyone would go there.
very unprofessional...my son's first driving portion of the class was canceled...but not by me!
unfortunately, that never occurred.
definitely would not recommend.
i have no issue with the dealership - except who they hire!
if you're going to purchase from this dealership, stay away from salesman paul landau!
we have purchased over 12 cars in the last 16 years.
the man can't open his mouth without lying!
paul shouldn't be working for any company that respects it's customers business!
it's like everyone here is sour on their job.
i actually think its a part of management.
not a hello, excuse, my apologies...
its quite unprofessional and truly disrespectful.
the bright spot was the pork belly, delicious on its own!
unfortunately we were not the only patrons (saturday night) that came away disappointed.
juanito amore' no more por chicka
i am so disappointed in the customer service of this place!
super suckprobabely never come back again!
the teachers are okay but the enrollment service department is full of morons!
the advising sucks too.
stopped here to change my 6 month old daughters diaper.
usually mcds have really decent baby changing stations.
and i use the vacant stall quickly and leave.
mostly because you have to wait in ridiculously long lines for everything.
this place sucks.
uses the oldest thickest polish for gels.
chipped within four days.
don't go here please.
this is the most disrespectful top golf in arizona.
then when we asked for coupons or free games they told us to leave.
head management was very mean.
never coming again m.
first time dining there today and i was not very impressed.
the only good thing about this joint is how amazingly cheap their dishes are.
the food itself was fairly good especially for the price.
it made me uneasy eating my meal afterwards.
we weren't even acknowledged with a simple "thank you" when leaving.
and i advise not going to their washroom.
leaving your pet here would be like leaving her at the pound!
it smelled like dog pee!
dogs are constantly barking!
the cages are barred and the dogs are jumping up on them!
we did not leave our dog!
they continuously ignore me and take me to a booth.
today, after been taken to a booth again i reminded her the table requested.
she took us there but a family was just given the table.
no apologies from the girl, just told me to pick another table.
it's a limited menu and mostly kale based.
now maybe it's different if you are going here to drink and hang out....
called to get pricing on tinting for my truck.
dr. sharifian spent all but 2 mins with me.
i had to volunteer my medical history and even then, it felt dismissed.
i would recommend that others save their time and visit another walk-in clinic instead.
update: i went to a different walk-in clinic to get a second opinion.
only if i could say something good about this place .
but unfortunately  i can not, my mother-in-law comes to this doctor office .
she makes a appointment  everytime .
and every time she comes here walk-ins are seen before her.
this is absolutely  ridiculous.
i would not recommend  this place to my enemies.
waited five minutes at the doorway to be seated.
i was hoping this was not an indication of things to come.
once seated the waitress was pleasant and prompt on things under her control.
placed and order for  for lasagna and had to wait 45 minutes.
while the portion was huge, the service was incredibility slow.
would i return?
possibly if the service was faster.
worst restaurant ever i visited in my life.
i got a huge silver wire in my food.
when i called the restaurant they refused to accept their mistake.
i wish i can sue them for this.
god bless all their customers.
their comment below is hilarious.
what they're missing is that they never actually serviced me during those months.
they never showed up.
i refused to pay because nobody actually came.
and then they put it on my credit score.
fortunately, i got it removed.
quality has deteriorated significantly.
me and my boyfriend went to this location yesterday.
the girl and guy worker were not helping us much at all.
we just took our business elsewhere.
so you guys lost out on over $100 sale!
we will not be coming back to this store and that is a promise!
just paid almost 9.00 for a really bad cheesesteak.
save your money and go to jersey mike's.
they at least have decent philly's.
horrible customer service.
just use the usps or ups.
to even lying and saying the system is down...while he worked on the computer????
i travel a decent amount and tend to end up at starbucks rather often.
this is by far the loudest starbucks i have ever been in.
some, not even close to being understandable to be spoken in front of customers.
we went there mi and my wife just for the grupon deal......
what a big mistake!!!!
if you're not spending big money the don't give a s....
i had the vegetarian sammich.
worst experience ive ever had at a resturant.
1st the boy who was cutting the meat was cutting us slithers of meat.
i almost threw up.
anyway if you want a good brazilian spot avoid this place at all cost.
horrible customer service.
i would give it 0 stars if i could.
save your time and money and pick a different place!
the owner hid facebook reviews so you can't see anyone's negative reviews.
absolute worst location in america.
this place is horrible.
visited this location yesterday and paid for the $149.99 package.
don't waste your $70 like i did taking my wife.
you walk through 4 rooms with each avenger being the attraction.
you look at screens and that is it.
no big finale!
so disappointed, shame on you treasure island!
took 20 minutes for store bought chips and salsa.
terrible, terrible service.
will not be returning.
sooo on monday i paid $50.00 for cinnabons to be picked up wednesday.
yes i am pissed off...
and yes you will listen to me complain since you screwed up...
i left when i noticed the utensils were not wrapped in a napkin..
just sitting there on the table update: utensils still on the dirty table
their sign said open until 10pm.
i guess they don't really give a shit nowadays cause archi has multiple locations.
to mr. archi, i always see you driving around with your lexus ls 460.
i just hated when your staff rush me all the time.
i decided to ask for my money back.
i'm only giving them 1 start because i can't proceed without giving them one.
finding the tower 4 guest elevators will cost you an arm and a leg!!
avoid unless you need a place to crash economically right on the strip~!
poor customer care.
it's 48 degrees outside and they tun on the a/c because staff is hot.
no consideration for the sick and elderly in the waiting room.
hours plus wait for no reason.
got another option?
go there not here.
found a seat but the place was freezinnnnng cold.
grungy looking but we went because we heard the biryani was really good.
the biryani had more spice than flavour so it was very disappointing.
it could be that they rushed it because they ran out..
i'll probably go back to try it again to see if it's any different.
the chicken 65 was good though!
today was the first time i went to that casino and the last time.
it looks horrible inside and out.
we called to complain about how we were treated.
i believed we spoke with head of security and nothing was done.
their drivers are horrible.
had we not seen him he would have completely caused a huge wreck.
thank god nobody was on the other side of us.
can you imagine what they do with your car????
do not even try!
i have never been treated more rudely in my entirely life.
the staff is completely disgusting.
absolutely avoid this place!
horrible, horrible service.
i would not refer this place to anyone.
more people started to come in and the place started getting busy.
an hour later i finally was seen after being skipped over twice.
my daughter left after an 1 1/2 hours later still not seen.
we were being skipped over!
wow.....i have never seen worse customer service.
called them to get a hardly worn pair of shoes fixed.
they were never sent out to be fixed and no one had called me.
i ended up going in and taking them back.
i got them fixed else where and with a lot less attitude.
avoid at all costs.
insanely slow, hot, and disgustingly dirty.
take an uber instead...
you'll thank me later.
ride share is only a few bucks more and we'll worth it.
avoid, avoid, avoid.
you have been warned.
this is the sign that greets you when you have a 4pm appointment.
no phone call, just a wasted afternoon off from work from me.
i scheduled a new customer appointment with kellie based on yelp reviews.
i left after 40 minutes.
apology not accepted.
poor customer service.
one of the worst dining experiences i've ever had.
i will not be back.
tasted like cardboard with cheddar cheese on it.
plastic bags of pre-shredded cheese, chicken was mucky and had no flavour.
service was super slow.
our soups arrived cool to the touch.
asked for hot soup, it took 20 minutes.
ordered two salads.
one arrived without bread.
asked for bread.
he said yes.
10 minutes later no check.
don't eat here!
complained multiple times nothing is done.
employees buzz them into the bathroom so they can take a sponge bath.
i only went here because i lived next door.
i moved and will never go back
in addition, the hotel staff was also not polite while talking.
even if we ordered starters first everything is served at the same time.
so what's the meaning of appetizer?
don't use this company.
their rating on the national load board is the lowest i have ever seen.
sadly, this location is now closed.
very racist to white people!
they arrived first and put their name on "the list".
not exactly a welcome environment, i won't be back.
we used to really enjoy grazie.
the service was poor.
our waitress was very distracted.
once we finally ordered, we were told the appetizer was not available.
the pizza came out with a burnt crust.
the chicken parmesan was tasteless as the bolognese sauce.
one special was tasty.
had to try to get the waitresses attention for everything.
we will not be coming back.
good first impression but subpar followup communications.
it would be a cool venue if the staff didn't have such bad attitudes.
it seems to be the same issues this place had in tempe.
overly aggressive security....bad attitudes from all the staff...bad sound..overpriced drinks.
i will never go to this venue again.
note to the security staff....you are not the show.
club red = lame.
we were regular customers when they first opened the food was great.
but we quit ordering when the food quality went down hill fast!
both came so dry.
was going for several years.
and they would charge the tax.
complained to the owner who played stupid.
machines break down i get it but this happened about 4 x.
and those r the times i went.
i stopped going.
got fed up.
this place sucks!!!!!!!
the first thing they need to do is remove the minute clinic sign!!!
there is nothing minute about it!!!!!!
finally, i just left!!!
no live people at the clinic counter, just a computer to sign in.
avoid this place in a minute!!!!
have been for wonderful dinners in the past so thought we'd try brunch.
service excellent and they did comp one of our meals.
a very quick comment: over priced !
bad service !
dislike the cash deal!
it's not "free" if it costs you your freedom.
sometimes the truth hurts!
recommend zen fusion which has much better service and food.,
she came and checked on my table once in 45 minutes.
never coming back to this location.
would give 0 stars if possible.
the resale value will be reduced as a result of the accident.
very shady and unethical.
i would never get insurance with them!
how is that legally which it's not.
i called them to ask and they hung up on me.
terrible customer service from the manager!
omg, is this not a buffet?
where was the limit 2 sign??
who goes to a buffet and leaves hungry and have to eat elsewhere?
had acupuncture done here.
staff was rude, didn't listen and very offensive.
pushed his own business.
find a more professional individual who makes you feel safe comfortable and relaxed.
will not be returning to this location.
the company only refunded $100 for the tardiness.
outreach to any higher level managers at this company went unanswered.
i would highly recommend anybody stay away from here.
they rip you off big time.
between my wife and i we spent over $7000.
my wife got her brazil and upper lip done.
i got my happy trail, my nipples, and my neck and cheeks.
for 3500 at simplicity laser i could've had my whole body lasered.
worst nail experience ever!
so it's 75$ for a french manicure?
i think not.
i would never return and my nails look horrible!
really bad service and very rude employees.
they have lost there best groomers.
poor customer service.
we won't be taking our dogs there anymore and neither will our friends.
the very worst las vegas has to offer!!!
the doctors are horrible.
don't risk your ability to see!
would never again take my parents to this group for cataract consultation.
one dr kept stating my mother's cataract was not ready.
we went there for dinner last friday.
there was no line at around 6:30 pm and i'm not surprised.
it had a good flavor, at least.
my kids said that the ice cream was terrible, however.
imagine how bad it has to be for kids to reject ice cream!
great when she's in a good mood but beware...
her smile quickly became a scowl and she wasn't very pleasant anymore.
which it wasn't.
ambiance is nice, but food just ok.
waitress was very rude.
she slammed drinks in the table and then double charged my card.
i won't be back.
we were the only people in the lounge and the music was uncomfortably loud.
the place was pretty run down.
the bartender was beyond rude and impatient.
i'll steer anyone i can away from this dive.
booked an appointment for 3:00 for my 2 small dogs, they called and confirmed.
i figured i had wired this long, why not.
very disappointing experience for a first time visitor.
but i was terribly mistaken.
but the place never ceased to amaze me.
at the bird store now :/ its closed...4pm.
advertisement says 5pm.
i wish business updated their hours
this review is specifically about the parts department.
i have an older toyota celica and called in to get some parts ordered.
my guess would be that the first service rep.
what a hack.
i order a simple meal of hot dog fries and a mixed bevrage.
except i had to place my order 3 times with different employees.
some of which were intoxicated.
ok so this store is actually disgusting.
i understand it's dollar tree but like damn.
also i didn't appreciate the conversation i had with the cashier.
let alone in general.
this gym is very dirty and people are horrible.
i will not be coming back every.
the food must have been great....
couldn't have been...
they are closed!
that's french for "the food sucked!"
this place is a joke.
beyond pissed off.
i met with a few friends for lunch here on saturday.
we decided to stay anyway.
bland, boring and left a lot to be desired.
the unchicken was uninspired and just average.
save your money.
perhaps their dinner options would be better..
but i doubt it.
good donuts, but not a fan.
i'm tired of making trips to huntersville only to find empty cases.
no, the donut lottery is a game i won't be playing.
the chicken tasted smoky.
1/31/2010 my family and i visited beso hoping for great dinner experience.
overall i was disappointed with this restaurant definitely do not recommend.
i hope your parchment paper is edible.
i ordered a large poutine via delivery.
they must of overcooked it and got stuck on the paper.
i had to completely throw it out.
maybe try using aluminum foil.
extremely disappointed...decided to try this new resto based on the high rating and reviews.
this was hands down the worst experience of my life.
i did not look until i got back home, and they were horrible.
i would not recommend to my worst enemy.
worst experience i have ever had at this place!
the food was super salty and they could not get our order right!
this place is awful.
it's so disappointing because i've had great happy's pizza before.
someone needs to come in and take control of this place.
there is no excuse for running a garbage business.
it's time to stop making excuses and put this place out of business.
stop allowing people the belief of entitlement.
i had the most bizarre experience today at brunch.
bask's website says they open at 10:00 am on sundays.
open table starts accepting reservations at 10:00 am on sundays.
worst service i've had in a long time.
next time, go to a different panera.
bought the groupon and it was not worth it at all.
please don't go here, plenty of other options next door and in the area.
i expected more from this restaurant.
food is ok, server is nice, but the price is very high!
their price went up.
not worth it for the quality of food you are getting.
even with the groupon.
will not come back.
like everyone has stated, appointments are worthless now a days!
not what it used to be when it started .
i'm calling to cancel next week after filing my first claim.
go with someone reputable and check their yelp rating and bbb score.
btw these yahoos aren't members.
don't get the peel & eat shrimp.
they do not clean the poop vein.
food is lukewarm, and it seems like they really don't care.
lied about how long my package was good for.
expired and lost a tan i payed for.
bad customer service !
and only tried to sell me another package!
we purchased a brand new toyhauler from blue dog rv in las vegas.
we wanted the ramp to also serve as a party deck.
they have never responded to us.
expensive cupcakes for terrible taste!
i got a red velvet cupcake and it didn't even have cream cheese frosting.
you can go to fry's and get better cupcakes.
don't waste or time or money here folks.
the worst customer service i have witnessed in my entire life.
the lady who does eyebrows here is rude beyond belief !
i heard similar things from my friends but gave her the benefit of doubt.
i ordered one to go and forgot to check it.
i get home  and this is what i got.
(untouched) overpriced for what you're given.
went there for a cut and a dye.
left after the cut because of how poorly the cut was done.
definitely didn't trust them to do the dye.
how about this: i have a "no patronage" rule for this movie theater now.
they get one star because there is not a lower rating.
they were sold out when i showed up on time for my reservation.
no apologies from payless, just too bad, so sad for you.
safelite came out and tried to fix a crack.
simple rock crack, had many similar fixed before.
i was told $700 to replace window.
he said the fix is safe and safelite guarantees their work.
two weeks later the crack is spreading.
thanks safelite, instead of fixing the crack you made it worse.
first of all, i have nothing against the employees that work there.
i think this will be my last time at this place.
the last few times i have eaten there things did not go well.
went there on march 18, 2018.
the meal was good.
the smell wafted into the dining room a bunch during our meal.
we spoke to their manager, she claims it is the smell of soup burning.
really unfortunate that she thought we are idiots and lied.
there were kids and a pregnant lady that were in the dining room.
at first we had a good time and the waitress was nice.
we didn't do anything wrong and i consider his action belligerent.
i haven't tried to go back because of the terrible experience i had.
it takes almost a month to grow my eyes brows fully !
why say yes you understand if you really don't !!
this is the newest girl, so disappointing!!
this place is so horrible.
steer away from this place.
gin drink watery.
mashed potatoes: from a box?
cheesecake: not flavorful.
thoroughly not impressed!
we arrived at the venetian and looked at all the offerings.
my husband ordered the halibut which was good but came with nothing.
i ordered empanadas with a dude of plantains.
the empanadas were hard and lacked taste.
there was just nothing good to write about chica.
actually i would rate it less than one star.
she was making up airline policy as she spoke.
my grandsons were flying home alone on the plane.
i could go on and on but you get the idea.
i doubt liyuen will take action to correct this misleading approach.
if they do, i would be happy to reconsider my rating.
just went here to pick up a gps.
after asking an employee for help on getting one, we were ignored.
if you like to be ignored - go here.
if you actually want to buy something - i'd skip it.
does best buy train it's employees to be rude and not help customers?
they sent me to this store to exchange the medium coat for a small.
the guy was a complete asshole doing the exchange!!!
that is the rudest thing to say!
what a hater!
shameful treatment of people seeking healthcare, especially adam schwarz, what a jerk...
5 stars for the service and hard work of the staff/ chef.
i don't blame them for my dissatisfaction...
it's the flavor or lack there of with the food that disappoints me.
seriously, spent $40 on food that "blaze pizza" could do better.
hell, little caesars is better tasting.
we had the restaurant week special ....beef tenderloin risotto.
this was nothing more than risotto with gravy.
there were no beef pieces in the meal.
.....second trip to bonfyre with a real bad experience.
we will not be back.
walk up, signs saying they're closed for routine maintenance.
not signs of a well run restaurant
what a disappointment.
possibly the worst nachos i've ever had.
stolen thousands of dollars from me.
sold us garbage products and refuses to refund or return.
do not buy!
ohh hell no!
terrible..i never..but never ever want to be not 2"s near her again!
everything is working great now!
too bad for penguin.
they have some nice shoes - stuart weitzman, sam edelman, toms etc.
too bad that every time i've been in there, the staff completely ignores me.
one time, a guy who was working there was a snotty jerk to me.
2 stars for the selection.
zero stars for service.
1 star average, then.
send the same generic response to every negative review isn't getting you anywhere.
here's a tip: go. to. puff.
the customer service is just so cold and unwelcoming.
overall the experience was just subpar and we are definitely sticking to puff.
was denied access to this restaurant due to my service dog.
was told that animals are not allowed.
service dogs have public access anywhere the public can go.
denying me was illegal and i will be filing a report to the police.
the bar tenders are really terible.
there are much better and fun bars at south side and strip district.
so i ordered from here because it was something new.
i got a combo and now i have food poisoning from it...
i would never go here again.
i got lucky that my friend has my child for the weekend.
the food was mediocre and the service ok but not outstanding.
i will not go here again.
not worth the groupon we used!!
meat was over cooked or flat out raw.
the hot side items like beans were cold...meat was stringy...
no option to wait, just asked to leave.
don't know if we'll try to give this place a second try...
they deserve zero but it wouldnt let me post...
we rode in cab 104 in tempe.
the man driving the cab was hostile on arrival, very rude, and not cooperative.
he kept my wallet and would not return it.
this is why cab services will not succeed much longer.
i hope people learn from my mistake...
incredibly rude first impression.
i'm inquiring because i want to book services for a large group.
terrible first impression and as a result, a potential customer lost.
worst eye care facility.
services were provided to my husband as an outpatient service for the military.
dr. tran and her staff billed for serviced not rendered.
they performed subsequent eye fittings just so they can collect from the va.
their staff is rude and dr. tran is never there.
i don't trust this company with my eyes let alone my money or insurance!
wish i could give no stars.
management is unprofessional, unsanitary, and rude.
most disgusting health code violation.
she took my sandwich which i had already bitten.
huge health code violation.
who knows how many orders she tainted with such disgusting habits.
poor management all around.
dropped by wanting to check this place out..
they are not very helpful at all.
the general manager refuse to try a work out s reasonable price.
i am crying as i update this review, but it must be done.
service is still excellent.
that's when we should have walked out.
i don't live with my parents so there's no other food that we shared.
sad sad sad week for us here!
i have not had a relaxer for 4 years.
i have had the same dominican stylist in houston for years.
i moved to charlotte and this place was highly recommend.
i agreed to try it her way out of desperation.
she had  a very unpleasant attitude.
i cant spend my money here.
(and its actually cheaper in houston).
not worth the money.
shows again a name is not everything.
over salted fries, dry burger, boring bbq sauce.
rude people should not be in charge of taking donations.
i'll be taking my stuff somewhere else from now on.
if i could give it a zero i would!!!
i get back to work cut it open and it's red.
that's a big red flag for me, so no thank you.
i wish i could give this half a star.
it's just absolutely awful.
save your money for beatles love.
the men wear man thongs...
if that's your thing, then go see it.
what a terrible company!
i was very excited to have found a groupon for this service.
i hung up and went to the website to do so.
i left a message and i never got a call back.
not one call was returned.
no big deal, we know groupons are sometimes limited.
tasted frozen and had that "not so fresh" fishy taste.
anyways, sad to say, we will not be coming back to this place.
money is better spent elsewhere...
speed away from speedee mart (you might get shanked if you don't).
just horrible customer service and will never be going to that subways again.
arrived 10 min after they had opened one day in -30 weather.
we were not the first customers as there was someone there already.
no greeting, no smile, all three just stared.
at a boba shop.
needless to say, it was pretty disappointing experience.
everytime i come here they forget something in my order.
they all seem to be rude and hate there job.
even though the item was behind thr glass case.
never been to a more disgusting and dirty store in my life?
guess they do not know how to shampoo their carpet?
you see carpet stains every where at this place.
clothes just thrown back on the racks, just a cheap place.
booked a premium level car.
was given a 46,000+ mile chevy impala.
crappy suspension, bald tires, squeaky passenger side window.
also smelled like someone sprayed stuff to cover up a smoker.
will never use this company again!
this was the worst buffet i've visited in a long time.
overall bad, didn't even try the dessert.
i would give no stars if i could.
she is a puny brown haired young girl with glasses and tattoos.
total human trash!!!
we wanted to like this pizza after receiving a nice ad in the mail.
the ordered arrived ten minutes later and the pizza was cold.
the salad was brown and pink edged, so we threw it away.
we were very disappointed overall.
i've been here several times and so has my husband.
we've seen a different doctor every time.
tests were done without ever giving results.
doctors were chronically late, reaked of smoke, and dismissive.
i should have listened to the reviews.
horrible customer service..
i pulled into the parking lot at 7:55 when they close at 8pm.
decatur because the girls that work there have major attitude issues.
the last time i went there i had it.
there were 2 girls standing around.
i was shopping for 5 people so my bag was pretty full.
that store didn't deserve my money!
they kept starring at my boys with mean faces and were extremely rude.
if i could give them zero stars or negative stars i would.
shame on me for picking this rental car company and never again.
no one knows nothing, everyone goes to "t" with their questions.
horrible terrible , total waste of my time
we waited 40 minutes for a simple manicure.
we were told we were next- considering we were the only ones there.
a few minutes later two customers walked in and were serviced before us.
the owner was rude, unprofessional and just a jerk.
we will never go back.
went to urgent care this past weekend and had a horrible experience.
granted i literally had no voice (laryngitis) and temperature and feeling like crap!
had me waiting in the examing room for the doctor for 25 mins.
the nurse comes in with my discharge papers!!!
also their rooms are not very clean.
the staff is utterly disrespectful and rude.
get new staff or train with better ethic
need i say more?
stay here but eat elsewhere.
but wow did this one suck.
i've seen my "crab legs and taquitos playing in my mashed potatos" before...
but don't remember the last time it sucked so bad.
won't ever go back!!
i went in and asked for someone to polish themagain.
i had to wait 15 minutes even though nail technicians were standing around.
no one was friendly, apologized or anything!!!!
even after leaving voice message 3 times, couldnt get hold of the manager.
stongly recommend against renting from them.
this review pertains to the pharmacy only.
they often don't have things in stock, and the customer is always wrong.
thank you rexall for figuring out that a generic was covered.
shoppers just told me "no" and that that was it, no alternative offered.
they also don't refill prescriptions before a certain 60 day period.
they will say, you need to wait 3 more days until it's covered.
never had that happen with any other pharmacy besides shoppers at yonge and college.
their communication is terrible.
honestly, they were no help in my job search.
it's a shame since i heard good things about them.
she literally threw plates at us and stomped water glasses kept shouting at us.
i didn't even eat anything just wanted to leave that place.
i am never going back there unless i get a proper apology from taharu.
i am being overly generous giving this place a one star rating.
i am a hertz gold member and have been over the last 15 years.
i was told that everything was taken care off.
what a disaster.
avoid hertz particularly in las vegas.
i felt as though i was doing something wrong.
and the property owner is to good to return your calls.
ordered through rapid pick up, which was supposed to be ready at 2:09.
i will not be returning to this panera location.
very old and dirty not well kept.
food was bland used to be so much better!
i would not recommend eating here,
it looked like a cute boutique.
she did look at me and that is it.
so we just walked out and then again not even a good bye.
i will never come by this store again, so unwelcoming.
service is terrible, it will ruin your night !!
first time here for a party off 2 after passing many times on mill.
we were seated outside, given our menus and that was it.
we waited 15 minutes and still not even  water.
we left, made sure the manager knew.
apparently this froots has closed.
this place has no stars from me!
we are in for a family reunion and i booked with hotwire.
last time i book a third party and not directly with company.
cost is over 500 now.
the car was dirty and the 2- 12 volt charging ports do not work.
we drove to san diego and needed our phones!
i called ace and was rudely hung up on numerous times.
took photos to make sure they didn't say i put the dents on car.
they have nasty attitudes and it's ridiculous.
avoid this location.
the reviews have to be from employees.
i have never been into a salon that was so filthy and disgusting.
when i asked if he would be sanitizing the equipment, he said no!!
i walked out.
in the last year we had a minor electrical problem.
the same brand as the home had originally.
the problem was solved.
apparently they had been using an inferior grade product.
am i the only one who finds this place over priced and under whelming?
(hidden charges bs)good concept, poor execution.
rudest staff i've ever heard.
are you kidding me???
that was dope.
the cheesesteak i ordered  was $7.95 based on the menu.
they refuse to order from them anymore.
i'm done too.
instead of metro center they should call it ghetto center lol.
misleading terms - car reserved was not available, claimed that buying insurance was required.
ended up walking away.
terrible service and poor pricing.
took 2x to get food ordered and it has yet to be served.
took another 10 min to get chips and salsa.
this place is horrible!
the wings suck and the service too!
luckily for us our waitress was the hottest one there.
never going back there again.
the gypsy looking hostess that "greets" you before you pay was rude af!
she had no manners.
also children 4 and up are full price.
i never signed a paper acknowledging a demo vehicle sale.
i should sue anyway for the dealership lying to me.
by far the worst service i have ever experienced.
i waited more than 30 minutes for eggs over easy, bacon, potatoes & toast.
my server gave me a 10% discount for my trouble.
for the first time in my life, i left no tip.
he ended up running to his gate without eating because he was so late.
i'd rename this dive "losers!"
this is not a fine dining restaurant with a fun twist.
this is ill prepared vegan food that you eat in the dark.
i swear it is like grade school cafeteria food.....only vegan style.
you will laugh, and you will be heading someplace else to eat afterwards.
i should of read review before i rent car from advantage.
never again from advantage
haven't been here since st. patrick's day earlier this year.
a lot has gone downhill since then.
scott served tables ever half-hour or so and gave off a terrible attitude.
ordered food and it took over an hour to arrive.
was told the kitchen was backed up and only 1 cook.
there were maybe 20ish patrons.
went over an hour sitting with nobody stopping by for refills.
learn how to take care of your guest!
speed is very important but so is accuracy!
i'm all broken out my skin is very sensitive.
they did such bad work i pray that you all second guess.
they definitely do not care about their customers.
they have work on the estimated thou the work has not been done.
this has been going on for months.
but whatever, so the food is suppose to be famous for their fish tacos?
not to mention that awful cigarette smell coming in from the outside deck .
awful, i really hope this place reevaluates their operation!
now i understand why there was barley anyone inside!
it's wendy's gross!!!
haha the place looks great after the update.
just backs up all awkwardly..
the food is the same so guess what...i won't be back...
i was really disappointed with the menu.
i like vegetarian options, but this is a vegetarian restaurant without healthy options.
the one savory dish that looked appealing was chili with cornbread.
it's pretty hard to mess that up.
however, the cornbread was way too sweet.
it was either a pumpkin spice or honey cornbread.
the jackfruit sliders were gross.
if you have had fresh jackfruit before, do not get this dish.
we also had the nachos.
they were the worst.
my husband ordered a sazerac.
it was gross.
she handed the drink to us like nothing happened.
we called her on it and the rudeness began to ooze from her.
the manager was very professional and paid for our drinks.
she offered to do more, but at that point....we just wanted to leave.
concession food is awful and overpriced.
the seating is as tight as a sardine can.
otherwise, this place is great!
won't go back.
i went in with high expectations but the negative reviews were unfortunately spot on.
this place is way over priced for what they deliver on.
i meet with clients several times throughout the day as part of my job.
we usually meet anywhere from 30-60 minutes in different parts of the city.
my client suggested that we meet at coffee rush in gilbert.
he or i usually order something at the start or end of a visit.
i've been here twice in the past month, around 7ish.
the drive thru takes at least 10 minutes!
horrible drive thru!!!!
anyway....i waited 5 weeks for this service!!!
i don't call 30 seconds of laying hands on me a massage!
at least the water was good.
someone said panda is better and they are right.
service is good but the food is not good.
will not go back.
do not use this company!
we moved from california to arizona.
a lot of our things were broken.
took my car in as it needed its scheduled maintenance.
they called me and gave me an estimate of over $4,000???
i told them i wanted a second opinion.
i do not think they are honest and i definitely do not recommend them!
never come back
horrible company that should be shut down.
worst decision ever to change the brunch menu!
no pork belly, no fried rice, and meat balls.
giant thumbs down on the menu change!
the server is still uhh-mazing!
awesome vibe and awesome service!
even the home button is not as smooth as before!
not very satisfied with their service!
went here sunday morning.
1130, 30 minutes past the time this place is supposed to open.
no one there.
no movement inside.
after reading several reviews, seems this is an ongoing problem.
doubt we'll go back.
too many other really great places around.
i think they are out of business.
one hundred fucking dollars to replace two watch batteries???
that's nearly as much as i bought the watches for!
walked across the mall to another store and paid $10.85.
the nurse hung up the phone my husband like if she was bothered.
selection is average and the food matches up to it.
the chairs itself are crap, feeling like a cafeteria.
simple turn around and walk out.
buy a warranty that is at least 5 years
the food is terrible.
they try to compensate by burying it in salt.
so called chili has no flavor what so ever.
never again will i eat there or any other roberto's.
i have noticed that they do not have any quality control.
what a shame making money by selling crappy food.
while some other staff were on there phones, laughing and not assisting anyone.
my husband went through the drive through and got me a taco salad.
i haven't even touched it yet.
it's the most pitiful taco salad ever!!!!
there's hardly anything in it and i don't recall ever having rice in it.
this has to be the worst denny's knockoff i've ever seen.
and the food was tolerable at best.
at least the coffee was okay.
but the breakfast buffet is ..
for no reason.
the lack of moral and customer service is unreal...
come on pep boys really ...
beware of this company!
the alarm never goes off even though it should.
worse part is people don't even have enough respect to wipe down the equipment.
absolutely horrible food.
have eaten here for years and the food has gone down hill 100%.
manager walked away in the middle of a conversation.
if i could leave no stars that would be a good start.
shortly after moving in noticed this place had an extremely  bad bug problem.
even after all of this still  bugs in the walls, door jams, floors.
all the bugs aside this place is like an episode of cops every weekend.
the staff is rude .
not to mention the nloice big bill you will get after leaving.
do your self a favor and avoid this place!
we checked ladles out one afternoon with the kids.
we love soup, and we're excited.
disappointment was to come.
the soup was very bland and lacked actual substance.
i don't even think it was homemade.
we were truly disgusted.
we won't be back.
even minus the hairy hotdog, the food was simply not good.
a bit disappointed with this place.
didn't measure up to the hype.
half the games are out of order and food is too expensive.
6pm and we were the only patrons in the place.
very unpleasant and unprofessional!!
not anything to write home about.
we had to do extra work on our part to make things work.
i do not recommend this contractor.
this taco bell is outdated and slow!
waited 25 mins in the drive through to get my food.
10 mins of it was the wait to even order.
poor customer service.
asked for a pretzel pizza.
was told by the clerk that he could not sell that pizza after 8pm.
avoid this one
my eggs were over cooked, but the bell peppers were raw..
and there was no way my omelette was 3 eggs, it was so small.
how in the world is this place getting good reviews??
tried calling manager later and didn't get a call back.
undercooked chicken with blood oozing out....
worst tasting and very bad service.
wth, is that standard answer?
is that the way to address a customer's complaint about the food?
the older waitress didn't even want to change our seating.
bad uncooked food, cold air, bad service - run!!!
don't eat here!
someone stole the number and used it to make their car payment.
there is now a fraud investigation open.
something fishy with this place.
overpriced for the quantity of food they serve.
all dishes tasted the same.
they are all made with same base gravy.
would never go back!!!
just bought this sunday, come to find out there's a hair in it!
i am so disappointed!
this location disgusts me to walk into.
there's products everywhere and no organization at all.
luckily, there's two more locations nearby which are much better.
this company does not even deserve a one star!
for all the reviews that everyone has read over this place.
they are all true!
this is by far the worse property management.
the staff is rude and obnoxious and very deceiving!
they should be shut down especially knowing that the bbb gave them an f!
i recommend everyone to go to a different rental management company!
customer service was bad.
the owner was rude and mean toward his employees.
i have ordered here before and the food was good.
frequented their casa grande location and was excited to try them in chandler.
the taste and value was consistent but that's it.
ice was broken in the soda dispenser, they got ice from the back.
in a word, ghastly.
with so many other and better options, i won't be back.
this used to be our families go to place!
there was 1 other patient in the lobby.
my child waited 1 hour in the lobby.
the girl working the computer was very slow!!
the service here has plummeted!
find somewhere else
there's a difference between fine dining/elegance and being pretentious.
the food also greatly lacked in flavor.
the glue she used is all over my lid.
over all they didn't even look good.
they're really short and it's not a cute look.
zero stars.garbage toughest grissle.never eat.they will not honor return or exchange.
so disappointed to drive 15 minutes to be told there is no salmon.
thanks for nothing!
this place is so shady and they take no pride in their work.
they also completely missed an entire door and window!
just because i'm not hispanic doesn't mean i don't know what that says.
i'm giving this place a 1 star for the moment.
the hours on yelp said open at 9am.
sign on the door says open at 9am.
we were there at 9:30am and doors were locked and no one was inside.
i called the number and no answer.
i was really looking forward to dinning here and even made the drive to.
1 star for the decent pork chop with spicy salt.
better food and better service at food express (see: http://www.yelp.com/biz/food-express-chinese-restaurant-las-vegas).
no go for sam woo lv.
grill was dirty and they were cooking on it!
i had to give it one star for the mere fact it has atms.
the customer service at this location is horrible.
i can't tell you how many mistakes this branch has made.
they fix one only to create another.
i won't step foot in this branch.
i would not allow my daughter to taste the food.
customer service was very poor.
questioning if i ever want to go back now.
we will not go back very disappointing
if you check in and there is someone there named carolyn....run away.
she proceeded to tell me it's not her problem.
go across the street to inn town suites.
that's like saying they don't have crepes!
ikea is fun until you have to return something.
they ask you to take a number and sit in their waiting area.
how is this ok?
they were terrible.
and i was literally given just sausage and cheese for my mcmuffin.
so much disappointment.
don't go here, it'll be a waste of time and money.
guarantee it lol, find a better location.
i came here today thursday 1/22/15 with my mom who lives nearby.
it was 4:15 pm.
the same person came and got our drink order of hot tea.
i left $5 dollars on the table and left.
and the light magically turned off a few days later.
it seems i basically handed them $1500 to turn off the engine light.
finally went elsewhere & belt just needed a minor adjustment.
this is by far the worst walgreens i have ever been too.
the workers are extremely unprofessional and have no idea what they are talking about.
i would highly suggest never going here or going to cvs.
this place was an absolute waste of time!!
always a long wait and uninformed employees...scary for a pharmacy.
poorly managed office and scheduling make this office not worth the trouble.
they keep using the excuse that they had just updated their systems.
find a better run practice.
if you are looking for pad thai go someplace else.
what they gave me smelled bad, and was way over seasoned with salt.
it was inedible.
for a carry-out chinese place this falls horribly short of already low expectations.
the only saving grace of the food was the fried dumplings.
just embarrassingly sad.
this place is sooooo smoky!
i almost had to cancel my stay after arriving here lol
horrible customer service everytime.
rude and very slow.
hertz needs to inform local renters that they cannot rent the shelby gt-h.
that it's only available for people from out of town with flight itineraries.
i made a reservation and confirmed before picking it up.
waste of time.
never again renting from hertz.
cancelled my gold membership the next business day.
the workers here were extremely rude and service is extremely slow.
when i first placed my order there was only one couple ahead of me.
i saw this happen to another customer that asked the same question.
would not recommend.
went here after cardinals game.
was noisy, and loud.
food wasn't good and expensive.
will eat somewhere else.
i came here a few days ago with the wife.
we had gone to them when they were in buckeye and it was awesome.
our experience this time was less than stellar.
i ended up scraping it off and throwing out the fry bread.
the price was about avg but still not worth the taste.
i dont think we will try it again.
first time going to rubio's ordered a mango shrimp salad with extra avocado.
don't order salads.
eine reine abzocke!
ist dabei jedes weitere 30$.
dr. rehl is an amazing physician with exceptional bedside manner.
laura - to be specific - it is the tone you use with patients.
it is condescending and downright rude.
too bad you can't give a no star review.
it's loud, obnoxious and an eye sore for the community.
worst place ever!!
the service is horrible!!
one star is too much for them!
never come back.
oh and they charge $7.50 for one oder of plain noodle.
interesting decor, mediocre food, slightly creepy accordion player.
salads were made way ahead (not good) and pasta was just ok.
large volume of food at reasonable (for vegas) price
my husband and i decided to try this place.
we walked in at 8:40 pm.
the bartender said they were closed.
instead of helping us because obviously you are hurting for business.
she told us they were closed.
after we walked out her boyfriend went in.
she was making out with him.
i guess that's more important than building a business.
i will never return
the return policy sucks and they don't take amex.
not a repeat customer.
got assaulted here on cinco de mayo.
security wasn't as responsive as they should have been so my assailant got away.
that was my first and last visit.
fun at first, but i went home mad and covered in beer.
the dancers were super hot though!
order a stacked turkey, but didn't get turkey...
very disappointing, especially after waiting 20 minutes.
i have been in dozens of dining restaurants.
while visiting las vegas, i thought we'd go to this serving  halal food place.
it was a big mistake: dirty place, very poor customer service and bad food.
have been in other pak/ind places, this is by far the worst biryani, kababs..
i just had a horrible experience with these people!
i did not know the father's name, but i knew his son's name.
and she just wouldn't budge.
it was ridiculous.
go somewhere else!
my bill increases every month yet my services are getting worse.
i can't even watch a full episode of anything without the picture messing up.
pretty much every channel freezes up and comes in and out.
you're lucky if you can get through a 30 min show.
if we can't watch anything..
wtf do you raise our bill?
with a $13.99 price point, it is hard to resist, but you must!
the sushi is jam packed with rice with barely any filling/topping.
selection is also very small aside from the terrible sushi.
otherwise, looks elsewhere.
horrible horrible horrible.
asked for them not to put bacon in something and it came with bacon.
i just gave it away as i can't eat it.
because not putting an ingredient in is evidently complicated.
way too over priced.
$2.75 per drink.
not very happy with service either.
you sell tacos and bowls with meat but you don't have chicken?
super unhappy with this place.
its my first time here and i had high expectations.
its also too loud to where you can't here the servers or your family.
still baffles me that you don't have chicken..
the thing that ruined the night was terrible service.
we won't be returning..
terrible customer service!
they seem to operate based on an "if customers notice" basis.
seems like a bizarre way to run a grocery store.
got here at 9:00 for breakfast.
place was only at quarter capacity.
heard waitresses apologizing for slow service.
people were walking out.
so did we at 9:50 without any food.
we received our coffee quickly but couldn't drink it because it was awful!
customer service is terrible.
cupcakes tasted just ok.
amateur veg cooking.
veggies cooked inconsistent.
i have been here twice...steaks are dry and don't taste good.
yuk..wont go there again
bad service, bad food.
don't make a special trip.
it is not posted anywhere this is the policy.
other than that m.i.a .
never came back to check if everything was okay at all even once .
i never got a water refill .
i had to personally get up and ask, they weren't even busy.
i personally don't recommend this place .
horrible customer service.
i as a customer will never come to this location again.
unfortunately , i have to agree with most of these folks posting here...
got in this morning,  service writer, pam i believe her name was..
again rude, doesn't seem to care about helping...
the customer service is seriously horrific here...
i will update later  on the actual service they did on the truck
i can tell why there is a net 3 star review on this place.
we were downstairs for dinner and decided to come upstairs for a drink.
it took about 10 minutes for any bartender to wait on me.
possibly because i don't weigh 90 pounds???
also because he doesn't weigh 90 pounds.
great place if you're 85 pounds tops.
clearly against overweight people.
this place is filled with employees who cannot communicate properly and cannot cut hair.
this has happened to me twice now.
i asked for a normal haircut with my sides to be a bit shorter.
the lady was 'done' with butchering my hair within 7-10 mins.
she didn't even get to the top portion of my hair.
17 dollars spent on these useless people.
ridiculously long line and wait at phoenix airport!
wish i had used a different carrier.
food made with bare hands.
this establishment needs to be shut down for unsanitary reasons...
give me my damn money back, filthy asses
this restaurant delivered neither!
this fionn maccools rest was terrible.
also ordered the warm mushroom salad w chicken.
this was tasteless & bland.
my wife had the beet salad which had only a trace of beets.
this is worst company you can go for.
terrible signal coverage.
sure they are cheap.
but is it worth it?
f*k stay away from it!
this review is based on take out...
being from ny it's definitely the closest to "home" that we found so far.
i had some work done at this office.
it was like a horror movie.
he ground down  my teeth so far that my crown popped off, front one.
now i have to have a 1,000 tooth pulled.
the place is an absolute dump.
do not stay here.
i never know what is what when come here.
nobody is much help so i try to keep it simple.
no help here.
they make you feel stupid.
ill just have a hot chocolate.
portion was big.
taste very blend.
average food quality.
may not have tried the food, but the phone service is less than ok.
and people say new yorkers are rude.
if you want yesterday's garbage then this is the place to go.
the owner is outrageously disturbed.
this place hires a bunch of scrubs right from the sewer.
trying to pick up a pizza and you're a young female?
good luck not getting picked up on and "cat called"...
i took my iphone 6 here & it came out horrible.
the gentlemen was very unprofessional & even the second time it ruined my phone.
i paid almost 150 to just have my phone be completely useless.
i had to just go get another one.
i would not recommend this place.
got home and no t-shirts.
no tracking number.
how ontrac is able to stay in business is beyond me...
came here for a 1 hr reflexology massage.
place wasn't busy at all.
don't plan on ever trying this place out again.
wow...had a referral from my doctor.
called and was told that dr linder is not accepting any new patients.
the one other doctor in the practice is scheduling for next june!!
that's right, june 2018...8 months from now!
the receptionist seemed offended that i don't want to wait that long.
will be letting my doctor know to stop referring her!!!!!
very low budget hotel.
very difficult to get away from smoke even in 'non smoking' room.
very close to betting track.
tv channels pretty grainy.
this place has the worst pho noodle soup ever.
the soup broth tastes like a boiled salt water, not like authentic vietnamese pho.
only the true master of pho noodle soup should cook pho noodle soup.
making pho is not for amateurs.
the customer service was very poor too.
on top of that, the place was dirty and gross.
nothing special about this place, i say, spend your $ at a better buffet.
the worst customer appreciation place in las vegas.
won't miss the mediocre food from this place.
go next store to us fried chicken.
better food and way better service.
i even had a signed receipt stating they would honor the free meal.
of course when i came to get my free meal they didn't honor.
guess they don't value repeat business.
not a good experience at all!!
out of fried chicken, out of mashed potatoes, mac and cheese not good.
service was poor.
first and last visit for sure.
it was not good, at all.
you have to try it to believe it, but i wouldn't waste the money.
now, their smokehouse sandwitches are good.
so are their club sandwitches.
shame on them.
i was feelin' them for the well-priced $4.99 lunch special...
given also that chinese food is incredibly cost-efficient to make, it's a shame.
advertise the $7 lunch not-so-special and see how that works out.
i ask for a clean up and they take off half my eyebrow.
if anyone wants it feel free to ask for it.
because i am never coming back to this place again.
don't do it unless you have to.
this is easily one of the worst places i have ever been.
bad service, terrible food, and horrible atmosphere.
so what i'm saying is don't go.
get chef boy r' de you'll be happier.
this store has unfriendly, unprofessional staff.
the two girls were just at the cashier talking but totally ignored us.
this is one store that i won't be visiting again.
we won't be buying our next dog here.
i've called twice to make a appointment and left a message.
i went elsewhere.
so not happy.
hiw hard is it to return a call?
and then waited 20 minutes in front of the window.
i will not be coming back to this location again.
one of the worst doctors!
i would have walked out without paying if i didn't have a conscious.
the waiter did not deserve to be tipped.
sad i won't be returning.
as others have said i should have researched a little and read reviews first.
bunch of young kids working there that don't really give a f.
service is a bit unprofessional but i can deal w that.
what i can't deal with are all the hidden fees, stay away.
you've been warned.
mandatory $25 a day minimum for insurance.
go to a more reputable rental service.
the owner of the shop was really friend and she did my nails.
my nails turned out awful.
she tried to fix them but it made them look even worse.
i seriously doubt that i will ever visit this location again.
the bridal spectacular is an inconsiderate circus.
the dressing rooms were bombarded with some of the most inconsiderate and rude women!
based on what i witnessed today, the bridal spectacular is an absolute joke.
i would not waste my time nor my money on any of their events.
for an all you can eat place, the price is great however...
they don't give you the number of pcs you ask for.
you ask for 10 pcs of shrimp tempura, they give you 5.
waiter seems bothered if you keep asking for more food.
what's the point of that ?
it's like forgetting the buffalo sauce in the buffalo chicken sandwich
delivery never showed, no notification whatsoever.
won't recommend to anyone
my internet has become more and more unreliable.
when we call for help we encounter unhelpful short tempered staff.
very bad place to go and eat.
do not bring any valuables or leave extra cash on the table.
the loulou the waitress is a thief and the food was terrible!!
ok ,this was my second time here .
my first dining experience was  great.
service was good food was good.
my party of 6  also agreed with me about their entrees  ravioli , meatballs.
i must say that their staff is not well trained.
i've had them give me bagel napkins and my change all at once.
found one of them.
kept yelling and i said it's ok, i'll take my business elsewhere.
guess i get what paid for.
the experience i've had here was one of the worst.
who forgets their customers orders- especially as something as simple as a drink!?
was stranded with my car, used my insurance to get my car towed.
they arrived on time which was an hour after the initial request.
the driver and my car were mia for 2 and a half hours.
when i asked them what happened to it, they gave me something...
now i know why there weren't any one there other than us.
i got 5 pieces of beef with my pad kra pao dish take out!!
this is ridiculous.
and it was $13!
what a rip off.
for a new business they should be on it.
food is horrible, lack of customer service skills, and beer is warm.
do not rent from this rip off company!!
after they receive huge fines, they will eventually receive a cease & desist notification.
if enough people complain, this company will be unable to operate!!
what a joke**
their food was okay but their service was tense and cold.
i did not feel welcome here.
maybe because i'm not of the same race?
i'll not go back.
i came in when it wasn't busy and ordered a cheese pizza.
the two employees were standing around gossiping, not paying attention to my order.
the pizza was completely inedible.
two employees should be able to watch after one pizza in the oven.
they had to have known it was burnt, but still served it to me.
i won't be returning.
dirty dining dec.
slow food delivery.
place where the local alcoholics drop in to get their fix.
expensive for what you get.
it's not dirty and there a lot of people eating and drinking.
they don't know each other.
this place is awful.
dirty, smelly, and it's ran like the dmv with check-in windows.
i might fire my doctor for referring me here.
i've never been to such an awful mri facility.
a very money hungry office.
when you go in for your yearly physical they will bill you twice.
once for a physical and once for 1 medication refill.
such lies, they just want more money.
this is extremely poor customer service, i will be switching offices.
wasted a lot of time and nerves.
confusion: 30 days from ordering date of a new phone or shipment date?
who knows ...
because of many dropped calls and poor signal.
at&t fault, iphone fault?
perhaps both of them.
needed a quick fix for the kids who were getting hangry.
two happy meals later they seemed to calm down a bit.
this place was dirty...like nyc dirty.
kfc produces better fried chicken, very expensive, never again
the waitresses  are so rude and jerk.
in the library area.
(the old lady) i used to go there.
the place advertises an 11p sunday close.
unfortunately, they changed their policy and now close at 930.
there was also a roach running around the front door as we walked up.
are you kidding me?
oh, it gets better, i didn't even get any dressing!!!
i also ordered the crab stuffed mushrooms...inedible.
the client portal (tool used to make reservations) is clunky and unintuitive.
was tried to charge an extra day...
no notice or apology given.
second time coming to this place in 2years.
not impressed with the service of the bartender.
we sat at the bar and waited to get service.
i'm very disappointed in the service we received and will not be returning back.
it's shocking how establishments let their employees ignore their customers,yet let them text.
bad service = no tip
dress code for chinese food?
i just came to get a bite to eat and they refused service.
horrible food, i got sick last time iate there.
im sure my blood pressure went up .
this place gives me super powers - invisibility!
the best part?
i gain this super power on nearly every visit.
i really can't understand how this place stays in business.
i really try to patronize it here, but they certainly don't respect their customers.
unbelievably rude and unproffessional!
i do not recomend this business!
i tried to purchase a box of cinnamon rolls for a get-together this morning.
it shows the prices for only singles.
(btw-- they no longer carry all those sizes/types listed on the board.
only reg and mini.)
now it's a don ramon's.
while the decor is mercifully toned down, the food is really mushy and bland.
not even good for suburban mexicanesque food.
ordered a burger and fries, they were old and burger was pink.
i was on break when i bought it...came back 2 hours after my shift.
i can't readily leave work.
bar tender snatches my debit card out of my hand then re-charges me.
i guess he didn't expect me to ask for a receipt.
which is why i walked out.
jersey mikes has been permanently ruined in my mind.
over priced food!!!
don't order the steak i make a better one at home on my grill.
there was absolutely no flavor!!
very high priced.
don't waste your time!!!
i was there today with my daughter.
she never came over and checked on us after we got our food.
i had to flag her down and ask for more water.
i even said something to her about it, but she played dumb.
food wasn't even good to put up with that crappy service.
don't waste your time or money there....
do not do any business with this man!!!!
he is the rudest most passive aggressive man i have ever worked with.
i went to dr. forte by recommendation of a friend.
she ordered pt and asked me to return in 2 weeks.
worst doctor to provide primary care!!
she needs to learn simple bed side manners!!!!
this place is overpriced and overrated.
my first cut was $25, then $35 then it went to $45.
otherwise this place isn't that great, unless your favorite hair stylist works there.
they tell you 10-15 min but you will wait way longer.
next time i will pay more to a reputable company.
hours on the phone, running back and forth to the doctors, still no prescription.
horrible experience dan sherbondy was inappropriate and difficult will never recommend him
worst breakfast buffet in town.
totally not worth the money.
you are way better off at other places.
i purchased several "deal of the day" type vouchers for this company.
when i tried calling to follow up, their voicemail was always full.
when the day came, no one showed up.
i emailed the company again, but you guessed it - no reply.
one star because it won't let me leave it blank.
just so you know.
this whole foods is soooooo disappointing!
in chicago, i went once a week and everything lasted the week.
85% percent of what i buy is organic produce.
please note i am also a stock holder!
that's an hour and a half until the posted closing time.
this store rarely, if ever, answers the phone!
no one ever answered ...even up until a half hour before closing....
this is not christmas or a holiday.
the item i wanted was over $1000.
what would my service be, if they can't even answer the phone!
the slowest wendy's i've ever been to.
20 minutes in the drive thru is crazy for "fast food".
well it was no where in sight.
wishing 4 minutes it disappeared and was turned off.
the girls were acting weird and said someone came in and then left.
my find your phone service showed the phone was turned off in that store.
don't go here!
the worst service  i've ever had.
i would have been upset about the service but the food was even worse.
do not go here.
you will be sick with disappointment.
whoever manages this location runs one damn loose ship.
what the hell did i just experience?
dead empty on a thursday during happy hour before the steelers game.
just a couple guys playing video games.
sign outside mentions $1 miller lites on thursdays.
except we found out that wasn't until 9pm.
and happy hour didn't start until 5:30 so until then miller lites were $6.
the bar looked nice inside but the bartender couldn't be bothered.
no thanks, 1 miller lite and left.
spent $40 for 2 meals and some tasteless sushi.
got sweet n sour chicken and the chicken was dried and shriveled up.
fried rice was pasty obviously over cooked and shush had no flavor.
so mad i wasted so much on bad food.
we live in southern california, but we were out here for a family trip.
i'm very disappointed after all the hype of how amazing this place was.
we ordered their famous iced coffee, bagel breakfast sandwich, and their maple glazed donut.
the bagel sandwich was cold, and the bagel was not toasted and tasted old.
the iced coffee had no flavor other than milk and sugar.
i will never try dunkin donuts again.
the worse dealership in town.
wasting your time and lying.
wait staff was soooo horrible.
brought the wrong drink and argued about it then charged us.
kept coming for payment while i was eating.
she was smoking cigarettes.
maybe that's why we didnt get cutlery napkins or plates...
then she added the tip in the bill when she deserved nothing
purchases can not be paid for with an american express card.
i took my business to amazon and ebay.
this place use to be the go to for breakfast..
salt with extra salt...
bartender/manager on weekends is completely useless.
and the cooks can't make a simple fried egg.
seriously, how difficult is it to fry an egg?
so...bad food, bad service and bad management ...
personally i'd  be surprised if bld is still open a year from now.
this place is  a joke.
do not use them for your phones.
i ended up going in there today and retrieving my phone.
i work in the industry and i am completely mortified at their behavior.
this place will never stay in business.
i would stay away if i were you.
"20 minute wait" took an hour.
been waiting an hour and a half for our food.
they ran out of half of the entrees listed on their menu.
have yet to even get bread or raw oysters.
servers are rude and not helpful.
will never be coming back
this place sucks!!!!
i am all about supporting local businesses.
it is ridiculous!
went in around 12 or 1 on a saturday and ordered 2 coffees.
and it was way over priced.
definitely won't go back.
pretty sad for a "coffee" store.
sadly this restaurant was an epic disappointment!
the waiters didn't know the menu.
maybe come here if you have a corporate expense account
this place is horrible, service sucks beyond belief...
this is the 3rd time i have been there for myself or daughter.
they ask for insurance but are to freaking lazy to run it.
so, i get a bill from 6 months ago saying insurance denied.
now i have a f@cking collections on my credit report.
this company sucks!!!
don't waste your time no o e does there job right, except the doctors....
they don't honor ada accommodations.
trust me - enroll elsewhere.
also i taught college psych and knew more than some of the instructors.
they behave like a cult & it is a sub-standard school.
take the psych gre and go to a program that is ranked.
i have heard friends and relatives talk positively about rei for years.
i had never been there (until today).
vegetarian menu : made us sick.
we should have complained and left but we ate it and forever regret it.
there must have been a pint of oil in all our food.
a quesadilla is a plain tortilla grilled, and then cheese/filings are added.
other food was similar.
we went with our landscaper designer.
no one at the nursery had a clue.
we ended up asking one of the laborers for help.
none of the actual nursery attendants could help us with answers at all.
the food is great, but the restaurant is shady.
i had the opportinity to attend the easter bruch on april 5, 2005.
arrive eraly and had a drink at the bar awaiting friends.
the bar tender indicated they had 1,800 reservations which immediately concerned me.
the brunch was equivilent to a standard resturnat buffet with sesert thrown in.
there was no silverware on the table, getting water was a challenge.
the plates were never cleared.
asked several time for someone to take the plates.
how this place still draws a folllowing is beyond my understanding.
what a mess!
first, the order plus a bottle of water added up to $20.
i couldn't even finish it.
walked in at 103 walked out at 1:25.
was asked to pay ahead of time for a 25$ pedicure!
quickest pedicure i ever received.
will never go back!
thanks for nothing ruby nails.
wrapping up dinner now.
basically a repeat of others.
food is solid, not exceptional.
however service is pretty abysmal.
the only people that are hustling are the bus boys.
the servers are aloof and disinterested.
i think they've grown way past complacent.
server could have cared less when we pointed it out to him.
i won't be coming back here.
pretty terrible, the waitress was rude and the salmon was over seasoned.
i would not recommend this to anyone.
i have not eaten a meal this bad as far as i can remember.
unless you love the taste of salt then avoid.
thanks for the hype and the expense.
worst service ever.
sat 15 minutes without being acknowledged.
...we were in a hurry.
never going back.....
basically 1/3 orders are always messed up.
i never make any substitutions just order simply off the menu.
i just wish they got my orders right.
this place is awful.
the filling was disgusting.
will not be back.
there is no warning about a minimum in the large menu.
i so wish we could give -5 stars because this is what they deserve.
be aware this is such a poorly run dealership.
they will not respond to any complaints or any inquiries.
do not buy from them.
no matter how nice you think the salesman might be.
i'm not sure if they run an insurance agency or they just pretend.
don't waste your time on this place.
2nd time at this location both times bad experiences.
bar person rolled her eyes when asked what the specials were .
shitty attitude no customer service skills.
what's with the smell of chlorine.
probably wouldn't have written the review if she hadn't rolled her eyes.
left after one drink.
however today was the worst experience ever.
regardless i'm never going back there.
time to find a new nail place.
not the best walmart.
really bad experience here with their customer service.
this lady cashier name "rona" looked miserable and unhappy.
can't even say hi or hello.
if you hate your job, get another!
don't make me hate this place!
olivia completely ditched me for my appointment.
what a horrible service.
the place looks like a shack anyways.
kind of glad i didn't end up getting them done.
bad bar food.
in addition to this the sushi was not good.
this place makes fry's sushi sound amazing.
and they charged me $2.95 pre tax.
smuckers couldn't be farther than homemade.
just don't charge people $3 for lukewarm toast and crap jelly.
when i called them they said next time they check it.
what the eff check out now wow.
they lost a customer.
the doctor is never ontime!!!
i'm a fairly patient person, but every single visit she runs late!!
not 15, or even 30 mins late, i'm meaning over an hr wait!
respect others time!
definitely needs improvement!!!!
not impressed with the happy hour.
there is other places that actually have happy hour like earls and oj.
last time here for me for happy hour.
this place runs very slow.
with all these people that are working here they had such a long line.
i'm surprise we had a long line.
they need more people at the cash register.
i was so grossed out.
went for charlotte restaurant week.
i have never been so insulted at a restaurant in my life.
i'll never go back.
oh, and the food wasn't even worth commenting on.
the check in process to pick up a child is terrible.
something should be done and some calls will be made.
there is a 3 inch over hang on my cabinets that looks awful.
they gave the cheapest bid for a reason....their work is terrible.
the owner swore that this overhang was 'industry standard' as other contractors disagreed.
ordered the steamed chicken and fried rice in hot pot.
the fried rice only had pieces of taro and nothing else.
very plain and cheap on anything savory.
definitely not worth its 12$ price.
kind of a depressing dive bar - not really my kind of hangout.
if i liked the burger, i'd recommend only ordering it to go.
i went with a patty melt, and was not impressed.
i've been here a couple of times and had okay experiences.
tonight just reaffirmed that i won't be stopping here again.
finally i just settled with a maple long john and a glazed old fashion.
i was charged, $2.50 for the old fashioned, which is just ridiculous.
i ordered a soda and itsobvious it was never placed in a fridge.
cold pizza and warn soda.
i'm only pleased because it's a couple of blocks away from my house.
other then that, not happy at all.
i have an unlimited month to month contract for spray tanning.
only to find out dark is an extra $7 charge?
just pull the drawer and you'll see the clear solution, medium, and the moisturizer.
there's no dark solution.
ohh and their lotions are way over-priced.
needless to say my husband was more than mildly annoyed.
we're all busy, right?
super unprofessional and unacceptable!
time to find a new stylist.
by far the worst establishment i have ever been in to eat tscos.
the meat was overcooked.
the place dirty and the customer service a joke.
would not recommend this place.
recommend the one on sahara.
unfortunately the on trop has closed.
stay away from this location.
everything you want to order - everything should be in large size!
and you can see they have small size/cup available!
that's not the way to earn money!
honesty is still the best policy!
this is highway robbery!
it's not about the money!
it's about honesty and principle!
potato  salad was cold cold but full of red onion.
the beans were still hard, undercooked,  but tasted ok.
the pulled chicken  was not hot!
the tops of the bottles on every table table were filty!
new place, won't  go back!
grocery store sushi tastes better than this place.
service - was speedy but i came in at 3pm on a thursday.
food - i ordered spicy salmon and spicy crab roll.
it was very bland and no spice.
terrible room service, frequently skipped our room.
even when not skipped our room was hardly clean, usually just replaced the towels.
i only gave this credit union one star because i had to...
they don't even deserve that.
there are never solutions to issues, only more roadblocks.
we just got up and left and haven't been back since.
people please...the only good thing about this place is the ever apologetic staff.
the bartender kept apologizing profusely but it was apparently all ongoing issue.
don't waste you time here...for the bourbon any way
i would have given it no stars if possible.
i've never had anything worse than this place.
the taste of the food is overly salty and sour.
the chef are clearly not thinking about cooking quality food.
very very bad food.
many, many issues at this property which are primarily service-based.
the slot floor staff at night is miserable.
they are not welcoming or responsive in the least.
cocktail service: virtually non-existent for high-end playersthat's enough for now.
we did a car side thing.
which they told us would be ready in 15 minutes.
so i drove 15 minutes there.
and not only did i wait another 20 minutes waiting in my car.
but the food was burned, bland, and horribly cooked.
25 dollars wasted.
i hope this place gets shut down.
are you guys still waiting for my review?
well get used to waiting if you go to this place.
simple burger combo will be 20 minutes.
also the portion is kind of small and the extra charges are high.
as for the burger it's whatever nothing special.
screwed up my order, too.
ordered and paid for a triple and got a double.
i think they count on you being in a hurry so you don't complain.
avoid this place.
then when i had my make up done it looked awful.
she used the wrong color foundation and i looked like a ghost.
all for over $100...never again!
we were backin the neighborhood yesterday,  my husband needed a pedicure.
today we spent 1/2 a day at the er at the va hospital.
diagnosed with a fast moving fungal infection on his right foot.
they used to be soooo good!
if i can put no star or negative star, i will definitely do so.
come on, we all have motor with belt.
no one gonna pay for $435 for a year 2005 model......
don't go here!
this was the worst japanese restaurant i have ever been to.
service was horrible.
didn't even get all our food.
will never go back.
roaches in the bathroom.
dirty and cluttered.
saw that they were on dirty dining after we ate there.
i purchased items here before, but will never again deal with them.
i would not be upset if it sold for more than my highest bid.
in this case the seller also loses.
i would also not sell items with them for the same reason.
this place is truly a nightmare.
ec movers is a horrific excuse for a sleazy and discriminatory company.
do not use them under any circumstance, unless you like being robbed.
this company is a complete skam, nothing is free!
the taxes they charge are so exorbitant it's ridiculous.
sapphire resorts is a complete scam!!!!!
absolute garbage food.
we left our food on the table.
2 bites out of each and we could stomach no more.
called for a quote days ago and never got a call back.
the food was just like any other panda express "good".
especially when i pay extra for a premium item like walnut shrimp.
food full of oil and grease..
there is old indian lady in this place (waiter, owner..
god knows..), is full of attitude and can be rude.
my indian friends told me, she treats brown people different - racist!!
come back to port credit and copy the example...done.
i placed an order because i didn't want to wait
but the customer service at this location is horrible especially the manager she's rude!
she needs to find another job if customer service isn't her priority!
she couldn't honor a clearance price for the same products, the difference was $1!
oh my gosh!
after an hour wait, our cookies arrived!
we ordered a dozen mixed peanut butter, oatmeal and chocolate chip.
they were raw.
they looked like they would be good, but left us disappointed.
we had the driver return to give us our money back.
they double charged me for an expensive cab ride.
they will not take care of you if you call them with a complaint.
you do not get to speak to a manager.
they refuse to come to the phone.
i am going to small claims court.
worst attitude ever.
don't even go there.
i don't even know how they are still open.
the owner is so bad, she talks to us/other guests like demanding us.
we waited so long and even the ppl came after us got their dishes.
been here several times.
today was big disappointment.
cashier refused to honor a coupon because of a "system issue".
pulled chicken portion was minuscule and the rubbery.
green beans were warmer and edible.
dinning room was also disappointing with several dirty tables and debris on the floor.
won't be back any time soon.
went to a different dealership and bought the same vehicle for $27,000.
they will do whatever they can to get out of making warranty repairs.
they wanted $700 for a repair that was covered under my warranty.
whatever time frame they give you for an oil change at least double it.
beyond a poor experience.
at best average food and presentation and inattentive service.
insisted presented wine was fine after it was returned (corked...bad before and after taste).
we took our 6 month old puppy here to be boarded for 3 days.
we brought food and and gave instructions on feeding.
when we picked him up they gave us out entire bag of food back.
can't trust this business, we won't be back.
she was very concerned and we really appreciate her reaching out.
the employees look lost.
i ordered very very simple.
3 pizzas and 36 wings.
i went back and they apologized and gave me some cold wings.
this place sucks!
sitting in the waiting area as i type this!
to get a prescription refill.
been waiting for 55 min now.
see people get called back that's been waiting for 10 min.
sucks sucks sucks donkey balls!
wish i can give it zero stars
came for a fire and ice hot stone massage treatment scheduled for 10am.
i explained that the receptionist was on the phone.
i am going to save myself the aggravation and avoid this unprofessional staff.
it is club loud up in there.
not sure why they do that.
you have to scream to communicate with anyone.
i'll never come back because i like to actually interact with my dining companions.
food is ok.
service is barely acceptable.
all food except from chef's kitchen is cold.
totally disappointed for the almost $80 we paid.
terrible customer service by levi the operations manager at this location.
i was told by a sales associate to bring it back.
got there with copies of the purchased service plan....
and was told he would not help me....
he was unprofessional, condescending, tossed his business card at me and walked away!!!
do not go to this location
this place never fails to disappoint.
shopped here a few times in the past with so so cs.
this last episode drove me to write a review.
they dragged me to three different registers but no luck.
$75screw you too.
have a nice day.
disgusting service and horrible food.
would never ever go back.
there was a blonde woman as a hostess; completely unprofessional and rude.
will never ever go back
i think this place recently changed ownership or something.
menu is reduced and new people are running the show.
last four times i came for lunch, it was awful!
slow service, got order wrong (every time) and food seems overcooked or something.
used to be a favorite lunch place, but not anymore.
i told the complex and they claimed that maintenance would fix it.
the guy came, looked at it, said nothing was wrong and left.
do not live here!
if i could give a zero star review i would.
never take allegiant unless you like delays and getting ripped off your money.
worse experience i've had in any airline i've flown.
i really don't like mcdonalds in general.
i wish we had looked a little more.
we had an awful experience.
not only was the place very dirty, but the food was terrible.
the fries were cold and withered.
this was my first visit to mcd in at least 5 years.
it will be at least that long before i try mcd again.
i ordered a pizza for my children but never received it.
she said that the zero was not on the ticket.
(my table maker was 40 and the ticket was for order #4).
no concern or care after i told that i didn't want the pizza anymore.
we chose this place when our usual was closed.
the food was sub-par and not very appealing.
having paid for it we powered on.
we won't be ordering from here ever again.
do yourself a favour and steer clear.
the girl even gave me one of those evil grins and "thank you".
oh, how i wish i had a credit card to get a rental elsewhere.
don't use e-z rent-a-car!!!
i would give them no stars if i could.
i will never give mcdonalds another penny of my money!
you frankly deserve negative stars after that crappy of service.
p.d that's the 2nd time your ann location declined bank cards.
i would give zero stars if i could.
i paid almost $30 to wash my car.
my dash and cup holders were carelessly wiped.
service is not a priority.
it took a very long time for the food to be made.
the food was good, but too way too long and small portions.
this is supposed to be a restaurant, not someone's house!
the food should be prepped and served in a timely manner.
there was only 1 other table there at the same time as us.
i don't recommend this place for anything other than a tea.
set up a consultation and arrived early per usual.
there was construction in and outside of the building.
"this is my life now" she stated.
yes, a nurse for a surgery consultation.
unprofessional and disrespectful to a potential customer ready to spend several thousand dollars.
my chicken looked liked someone had spent some serious energy pounding it.
gives a new meaning to "smash" burger lol.
plus the atmosphere is very food court like.
worst hospital ever.
left me bleeding for hours because they couldn't verify my insurance.
i almost called an ambulance from another hospital to seek care.
unless you are dying and have no other choice please avoid.
bad food and even worse service.
do not waste your time or money.
07.06.16_they installed new payment stations that accept cash or credit card.
i put in $2 in quarters and it ejected $1.75.
what a ripoff.
used this place for years--no more.
i'm going down the street to saguaro carwash (11419 n saguaro blvd).
can you turn her mic up cuz i can't hear her!
where's the dj!?!
horrible service and horrible dj!
i really cannot understand how a burger and fries could taste this bad.
for 9 bucks i expected much more.
the fries taste freezer burnt and the ketchup is not heinz.
i feel worse now than when i was starving.
just avoid it.
24 hours later, i still can't get regular shoes on!
covered my legs in antiseptic spray and that helped the pain.
where my cuticles were trimmed too deep, they are still sore to touch!
this manicurist needs to have her license jerked!
wow - so tired of disappointments!
you've been fully refunded.
ok - why do i have to wait to know that?
the response to my request to be on top of your business?
they encouraged me about opening "more" locations - hahaha!
the taste in the latte was horrible too.
alex was one of the rudest cashiers i have ever came across.
i will drive to chandler from here on out !
not sure what the issue is, but i find it pretty unprofessional.
this was enough for me to not come back.
she was rude and had a scowl the entire 1.5 hours i was here.
all else was good, but my bartender ruined it.
find someone with a smile and more customer service experience.
-a customer and fellow bartender.
i always come here with a good friend of mine.
now, i & many of my well known friends all over will not go.
think about you business.
then they asked us for my email address & phone number.
i was like wtf!
do yourself a favor and go run in traffic with your hair on fire.
it will probably be less painful and cost you less.
worst service if any starbucks.
not worth it.
next time sticking to room service.
"vegan" tofu is fried with meat and animal products in the same oil.
i'm happy that the waiter told me before i order.
new number: 647 772 37266477723726 rude & bad workmanship.
i hired them to do a bathtub chip repair.
they completed the rushed job in 10-15 mins max.
after first use, all the paint peeled off and flaked.
charged my credit card even though i used airline miles to book the room.
they assured me they wouldn't charge me but they did anyhow.
then try calling, they'll only hang up on you.
plus, it was a moldy run down dump.
really cheesey finished.
the people working there were like zombies, really dull and dumb to interact with.
don't ever buy a seat in the last row of their reserve seating theater.
the seats don't recline and the seats themselves are very uncomfortable.
they're small and the seat is short.
you feel like you're falling out of it.
it started off well, with a very affordable $2 price.
whomever put the zip ties on wasn't thinking of safety, that's for sure.
we will not be coming back to this play area.
how did i get charged $50 dollars for something i never got!.
will never eat at that dennys and will never use uber eats.
one or the other is a scam!
if i could give this pos company a negative10,000,000,000,000 stars i would!!
my bad for having this expectation.
they call over and over to verify appointments.
systems didn't update to reflect new appointments.
definitely disappointed and would never refer anyone to them.
they do not follow through and end up charging extra for unnecessary appointments.
the food is not great.
it's like going to a 2 star chinese restaurant with an expensive price tag.
service is just okay.
will not recommend it to anyone.
we ordered pho, dumplings, noodle soups and a beef dish.
i expected more from this place for being in venetian.
decent wine selection but it changes so what is on yelp is not correct.
kinda dark and dingy inside, thought it would be nicer.
we ordered the charcuterie and cheese board.
cheese was good but the charcuterie was not charcuterie.
instead of cured meats there was bacon, salmon pate and cold chicken patties.
i guess bacon is a cured meat but what about salami, prosciutto, etc.?
it was disgusting.
disappointed and would not return.
casablanca express is a scam.
first off, just expect to be hung up on every time you call.
second, don't expect to get anything this company advertises.
after i sent $50 they sent me another letter  asking for more money .
casablanca express will continue to waste your time and energy.
everything i've read about this company is negative.
if you've already sent money to the company don't send anymore.
great place if you like reheated frozen crab.
slow service under and over cooked foods.
not worth dealing with this airline at any price.
my flight to idaho falls was late going out.
the return flight was even worse.
after a three hour wait our plane was able to complete the flight .
they issued me a voucher for 1/3 of the cost of my ticket.
i love my new rav 4.
what a great car.
right toyota is a complete joke, don't waste your time.
camelback toyota is much, much better.
overall i had a terrible experience and would not recommend this place to anyone.
i would eventually get an answering machine.
what a joke!!!!
you might want to check out the reviews on angie lists also.
quite possibly the worst starbucks experience i have ever had.
i ordered a flat white.
the barista couldn't be bothered to make it correctly.
i expect for my $5.03.
my experience has been awful to say the least.
well unfortunately, not in my situation.
please save yourself further heartache!
if you are having troubles conceiving, do research and find yourself another obgyn.
worst garden center!
worst customer service!!!!!
i've given this place at least 5 chances and i've been disappointed every time.
it shouldn't take over 30 minutes to heat up 2 slices of pizza.
tonight i ordered a white slice and they somehow got it wrong....
white slices don't have sauce!!
the staff is friendly and the places cute.
but the food and drink were sub-par.
i had the chicken sandwich.
it had a big vein of fat thru a tough piece of rubber chicken.
you're better than that.
supply you restaurants with some quality products.
the customer service & order accuracy at this location is disgusting.
my last order was wrong.
one manager says he will correct it next time.
manager on duty today won't honor that.
so i pay.
get 45 minutes away only to find my order is again wrong.
no dinner for me tonight.
i will post photos.
food was alright...
the wrap was stuffed with ranch.
the waitress was slow with service.
overall bad staff and a overpriced meal.
do not shop at this store!
2 hours for an oil change.
i was given no indication beforehand that there would be an extended wait.
i had an appointment but still had to wait 2 hours.
my friend recommend for me this place.
no category or sample to try the cake.
we have to blind our own eyes to go with this place.
i never recommend this place to my friend ever.
i adored our room!
hotel is nice.
valet parking is complementary but be weary.
needless to say we will not be returning.
second year in a row we fell for the $19 christmas tree scam.
last year we went back 3 times before finally going to home depot.
this year once was enough.
off to home depot we go!
don't waste your time at star nursery.
it's so close to our house but i hate deceitful advertising.
the second would have been all fruit flies and filthy windows.
decided to try again this morning and the same thing happened.
i personally have never accepted a job that i cannot finish properly.
note that i didn't even get a discount for this incompetence.
incredibly poor service and greed seems to be their game.
i go to urban bean a lot for coffee.
my husband and i have hit lunch there a couple times.
our bill came  -  yikes!!!
i think most of good reviews are old.
the chicken shawarma is very bad, do not try it.
the shish tawwok platter is fine, but not the best.
falafel was very cold and thick so the inside veg's are not well done.
the lahem baajeen (meat wrap) was also very bad.
we contacted living spaces that day to file a warranty claim.
so unfortunate this is our local jack in the box.
the lady bartender is seriously rude!
plus this place is empty and its 1:05am.
it was my first and last time.
she just threw the drink?
i mean seriously.
never again plus a fight broke out.
this place is a mess.
oh avoid this place @ all costs.
dr. hayes & dr. daulat have no business in the medical field.
taste goodreason i only give 1 star:open too late.
only after (5pm).
closed 10pm, they would not accept any orders after 9pm.
business hours are awkward.
seem they don't need business.
thought it was hard to mess up fried chinese food.
i was wrong.
had the egg rolls, crab rangoon and general tsaos chicken.
no flavor and no spice.
might be cheap.
but will definitely not order again.
unbelievably, horrible, non-responsive service.
horrible customer service.
worse service ever.
they are only out to get your money.
patches look awful.
not as described.
refused to help fix the situation, they only want your money.
how do you screw up a friggen burger?
ate here while attending a work conference, so we ate here for lunch.
here i'm thinking....
order a burger.
buzzzzzzzzzzhorribly dry and flavorless.
bun was made of depleted uranium.
if you ever attend this hotel....skip this place at all costs!
if you don't eat  it right there and then, it is a rock.
this place gives me the creeps, now.
the worst service i've ever.
no acknowledgment of our existence, extremely rude, and very confusing seating.
will not be retiring.
was so excited to try this place and i am severely disappointed.
update: although this place is very clean and nice.
the produce isn't the freshest.
produce is mouldy or bruised.
watch out before buying
i won't go back.
apparently they rather take care of their guest instead of their residents.
management is very unhelpful when it comes to having any issues.
the only way they try to fix your problems is by telling you sorry.
also, when then towing company towed my car they damaged it!
but our server (shirley) was soo aggressively rude to us!
that was not our fault!
also all the food was cold!!!
so i ended up leaving.
went to another store in the mall instead that also sell alex and ani.
was greeted right away and got what i needed in 5-10 mins.
too many many people, not enough cashiers.
hell most of the self-checkout spots are unavailable!!!
left spots everywhere !
it must not have soft water.
vacuums were half the strength as before it changed to this company.
they have some nice colored lights while you go through.
save that experience for disneyland .
we had to go over our vehicle when we got home again.
it has residue all over.
this place is a never again!!
went for lunch today.
space for sale or lease.
sadly, i still hunger.
buffet is not for vegetarians.
rice was hard from drying out.
veggie dishes were mushy and cold.
crowded and awkward.
staff is not helpful.
i recommend takeout.
we usually order and pick up which had been delicious.
we won't eat in again.
mr hero is good but overpriced.
however, this store itself gets a 1 star.
if you dont care about that or the price, go ahead and eat there.
otherwise, theres another one literally a mile up the road.
the only good thing at this place is the friendly staff...
the food however is ...terrible.
save your money.
i don't know how someone can over cook rice into a mash!
the curry was literally just curry no veggies or anything...
also had the tom yum shrimp soup...
not a traditional tom yum at all.
if they had a -1 star i would have put it.
8 of us sat down for dinner on oct 24th.
food and service was fine, so why the 1 star?
i thought it was a bit "off" texture wise.
two hours later severe food poisioning set in.
my complaint is honey salt will not even answer my emailed complaint.
that's the last $795.00 bill they will see from me.
never trust carol.
i contacted her on  june 6th and she never gave an appointment.
i called groupon and they said that it was not redeemed.
this has been going on for 3 months now.
im now resorting to canceling my card.
we left without having had our special occasion treat.
everyone very disappointed.
came to pick up some food today.
immediately the guy had some attitude.
i wasn't even done signing the check.
i'm going with they don't exist?
otherwise the place pretty much sux.
the food is mediocre at best.
the vibe is lame.
this place has pretty much run it's course.
time for it to close and re-open as something else.
hopefully under new ownership.
and minus the karaoke.
i will not be ever going back.....
seeing all the great reviews i wish i could try this place.
hopefully i can change the rating when my car gets here.
hire new people, next year.
preferably not teens who look like they can't stand to see happy, smiling children!!
not fresh; typical canned flavor fond in american chinese restaurants.
not real chinese foid.
on.par with panda express only i didn't spit it out!
good was hot - that's why it got a star.
i will be finding a new doctor.
don't rent here.
horrible,  one cashier for a saturday afternoon.
25 people ahead of me in line.
i've been here for an hour,  i just want to go home
went out to dinner tonight with my husband.
i ordered steak tips over rice, no gravy, well done.
what i received was smothered in gravy and the steak tips were raw !
waitress came around to take our order and to give us a bill.
that is it.
waited 20 mins before our order was taken.
then another hour+ for our food to arrive.
waiting over an hour for eggs and bacon is not worth it.
food was plain and nothing special
finally, never had much.
food not great.
i will personally never rent from hertz again.
extremely poor customer service.
they wouldn't consider spouse as a legal driver on the rental car!
had a rental for 4 days, was prepaid from kayak.
come on just for 20 minutes!!!!
also to mention, the quality of maintenance of the car was extremely poor.
it was rusted all around the gas tank, and very poorly maintained suv.
better options available, never will go to hertz again.!!
first visit:  the place was not busy.
waited to order.
waited for food.
waited for water.
waited for bill.
this did it for us.
we will not try again.
however when we got our table and finally received our tacos they were cold!
i'm extremely confused about that...
do they just serve all their seafood tacos cold on purpose?
the most horrible place !!!
went there today for lunch, ordered 3 regular size shrimp po-boys.
the place was almost empty, two other tables and us.
it took them 25 minutes to get the food that was tasteless..
i got 3 miserable shrimps in my sandwich.
if you got a groupon, get your money back !!!
good burger but no bacon!
apparently the owners do not eat pork.
craft burger: please don't mix religion and diner food....
my flight from los angeles was delayed as well!!
this is a piss poor place to live.
what they say the rent is isn't actually what you'll pay.
from all the fees and everything my rent is 100 more than advertised.
cops always on property.
do yourself a favor and move elsewhere this place is garbage.
la serveuse m'a demand pourquoi je lui a avais donn 10% de tip!
horrible service i'm huge on customer service.
meat was dry my sons foods was burnt and hard.
don't understand how it gets 4 stars
the worst and cheapest buffet ever!
they charge $30+ for low quality, tasteless food!
honestly go wherever even mc donalds is better and cheaper!!!
they've been out of vanilla roobois tea for three weeks now.
who does inventory?
most inefficient starbucks i've been to.
i ordered pastelim to take to a potluck and they were not fully cooked.
so everyone put it back in the container.
disappointing all around.
waitress was friendly though.
lara from front dear is the worst ignorant employee.
this was a sad experience, to say the least.
i will never set food in this place again.
the staff here was rude and in no hurry at all.
my dr has had to chase down results many times now.
looks like its time to find a new lab.
this canes is horrible.
i just go to this location because it is right by my house.
have wasted so much money at this location.
negative stars if possible.
they either can't accept cc or don't have whatever it is you're ordering.
$4.50 for a 12 oz coffee with no refills?
$5 for 12 oz iced coffee or oj?
i get that vegas is pricy but save your money.
it'll be better spent at hash house a go go.
i went in looking for pet supplies and ended up leaving absolutely disgusted!
i am going high up as i can on this one.
but no, limited menu and horrible service.
horrible horrible customer service.
they inspected it, smelled it and told me there is nothing wrong with it.
so screw this store and the owners.
the lady made a huge scene over $4.99 jar of peppers.
so embarrassing for them to show how inconsiderate they are to their customers.
the food at olive garden is superior to this place!!!
slow service, bland and tasteless food, overpriced, etc.
bad experience here.
i understand it won't be perfect but i feel they didn't even try.
horrible customer service, horrible attitudes and a horrible job cleaning cars.
furniture held hostage, dozens of up charges, lazy employees.
police had to be called to stop their threats, demanding more money, only cash.
absolutely the worst asian i had in past 25 years.
i got a headache after eating this garbage.
avoid at all cost.
no wonder i didn't see any line on a saturday afternoon.
disgusting waste of money.
not enough people working at the counter.
and it is a ridiculous wait.
please stay away and don't rent from here again.
overpriced and the food is just ok....
much prefer mt. everest indian cuisine further west on sahara
salsa was bland.
couldn't take more than one bite.
would not visit again.
also, no ac and it's hot!!
i came here a lot growing up and it was always pretty good.
it took almost 10 minutes just to get waters.
oh and my buffalo chicken pizza had no buffalo sauce on it at all.
it was bread cheese chicken and celery.
area managers need to do some more spot checks at this location.
check your bill as soon as you receive it.
great place to see ankle bracelets.
if your friends force you to go at night, jump in the pool.
service was terrible, mike was super rude.
i was having a great day until i came to this store.
i just can't stand rudeness and poor customer service.
whatever you do do your best!
don't they have enough staff?
it is dinner time already!
will not be back!
it's 3:45 pm and no bread available.
paid 80.01 for the dinner  buffet.
head chef says they are switching over from lunch to dinner.
then you should switch my bill from dinner to lunch.
the food was cold and meat was tough.
pretty sad for bellagio's.
won't be back...
very slow service.
expect to be here a few hours for dinner.
food was overall good, just very slow.
unfortunately, the service we received was horrible.
we talked to the manager on duty and unfortunately he was no better.
food was just ok.
if there were football specials, we didn't know about them.
an extremely disappointing experience!
worst car wash i've ever received.
looked like they vacuumed and threw the crumbs on the seats.
i went straight to the self serve vacuums and redid everything.
they didn't wipe the interior down at all.
i also had to do that myself.
this was a car wash valued at $28.
most definitely taking my business elsewhere.
ordered a cup of coffee and a spinach and tomato benedict.
no tell norm to get in the kitchen and do his damn job.
needless to say i'll never be back.
i left and went to another chick fil a and the service was great.
the first time the waiter spilled her fried zucchini and argued about getting more.
the second time she was overcharged for her meal.
there are plenty to choose from in the area.
worse host worse casino to stay at...
is it even legal?
and you got it wrong...
you guys are incompetent..
what a rip-off--kids cost full price?
we will not be back anytime soon.
and the food is better.
the buffet at paris also does not charge full price for kids.
we ordered our food and other customers received their food before we did!
not coming back and there is hardly any air conditioning in this place.
first and last time coming to this place.
so i decided to go ihop or ihob from dinner.
just as this happen the person/greeting said how can i help you.
i said a table for 1 he said this way.
i had to hold in my gagging reflex.
and to make everything worse, you removed asian nachos from your menu!!!!
that was the most creative, inventive thing you had on the menu!!!
ok, so not going back.
and, yes, the people i was with said the place stunk to high heaven.
i've ordered delivery here a few times.
the food here is just ok.
its average cheap food.
but when you don't feel like cooking, why not?
i ordered two items and only received one....
they still didn't get it right...
my last 2 attempts at ordering delivery from them have been terrible...
theres there's plenty of other options around.
over priced, nothing to justify the fact that its a burger joint.
breakfast here looked promising, but looks were clearly deceiving!
it was all a waste of money.
won't go back again.
the management is terrible, rude and very uninformative.
do not live here, you do not get what you pay for.
the worst experience ever on this airline.
don't use these guys no matter what!
they gave us no other options!
unacceptable customer service!
they should not be allowed to treat people this way!!!
i thought this was a japanese restaurant?
there are other hibachi restaurants that are more authentic and no meat heads.
these guys miss something every time.
windows, tired, air freshener etc.
they pestered me every time i went there to get my windshield replaced.
finally i did.
like free car washes.
stay away it's a scam
stay away from all desert appliances!!
they burned the espresso beans in my cappuccino.
it's a coffee shop right?
they should make good coffee and espresso drinks.
in addition, it took forever to get my bagel and cream cheese(over 15min).
a wednesday at 10am is hardly an overly busy time.
am i wrong to expect prompt efficient and quality service from a coffee house.
i had three sips of the cappuccino and pitched it.
save your money and go to lux or even starbucks for that matter.
completely all different shapes.
i get my nails done for my job and these are embarassing.
well here's the finished "coffin nails" done by the owner hai.
can't believe he let someone walk out looking like this.
hai said his nail service was perfect and they are an art form.
the most hostile staff i've ever encountered.
-10 for your customer service.
seems like you need to go to lunch .
let someone nice answer the calls.
my family will never come to your medical center.
this place was not honest.
i bought 3 dealfind vouchers to use here.
the environment was not professional.
i would not go back.
horrible customer service.
my hometown's reputation is ruined!
the mashed eggplant is a joke, served on pringles!
 is paired with dried cranberries!
shame on you safelite!
you should honor the price you quote.
eat your own mistake, hire competent staff, or quit ripping off the public intentionally.
has to be one of these scenarios, right?
the car was nice.
apparently they don't appreciate business here
this was the worst pizza place ever.
it's really hard to mess up pizza..
unfortunately, i didn't open the box until i was home.
the pizza was raw, even the tomatoes!
(look at the pic)..
i had no choice but throw it out.
pizza hut and dominos are 100% better than this place.
don't go there!
i signed my friend up 13 days ago.
no visit to date.
trying to call now, i've been on hold over 15 minutes.
this is not the way to run a business, especially a health care one.
the service was super slow and the waitress was not attentive or even polite.
the food was not good.
had steamed broccoli as a side and every piece was brown.
the burger was overcooked and had a weird taste.
every aspect of our experience here was terrible.
we won't be going back.
not sure why this one is so bad.
i thought i give this place a try since i was in the area.
i had their breakfast omlette with ham on the patio outside the shop.
the food was basically tasteless, enuff said.
i don't think so.
why do i go back you ask.
i just want to see if they ever have one hot n ready.
arizona authentic pizza is better and the same price.
drove 8 miles to use the coupon to receive an apology.
gotten takeout from this restaurant for a party.
we ordered 3 main dishes and they all tasted horrible.
the noodles we got smelled funky and rancid when we opened the takeout container.
the fried rice was dry like sand.
it seemed they have just reheated and packed it up for the customer.
the noodles smelled awful.
we threw out the entire container.
this restaurant has probably the worst chinese food i've had in my life.
definitely will not be coming back again!
not coming back.
if you're looking for a place to eat....
definitely not this place!!!
unless you're buying lollipops, don't go here!
i called their lawyer and the case was canceled.
ghetto, ghetto, ghetto.
ignorant & arrogant thugs.
i have it all on video...eat/dine at your own risk.
however, the grooming itself is not up to par.
he also had a small cut on his stomach.
the only positive is the cage less aspect.
we will not be returning.
terrible service at this location.
and tonight my hubby is the victim of food poisoning from the ca classic.
will be avoiding this location in the future.
can i give this spa and salon zero stars?!?
por favor people, i'll go someplace else!
don't ever go to fukuburger!!
disgusting to the point of making me sick to my stomach!!
it gave me instant trots!!
the fries were hard, stale and nasty!
watching news 3 and feeling really upset that poor people are victimized.
such a reality of this city
1 star for poor customer service...
cashier didn't write my name on the cup.
customers had to figure out for themselves which drink was theirs....
the workers look like they hate their jobs.
horrible bartender chick!
took some dudes order who walked up when i'd been sitting there 5 minutes!
this place is over priced and the portion is sooo small.
it's not even enough to fill you up.
the seasoning was off.
certain dishes were too salty and others were very bland.
i definitely would not recommend this place or go back to it.
well the guy had no patience with me and was rude.
did not answer any questions and just pointed to the packages on the wall.
also, they have chosen not to include salads with this order anymore!
we used to love rosati's, but i guess their new ownership doesn't get it.
besides that, they were rude and uninterested in resolving our concerns.
we will never go back, and i advise the same.
we went to la patisserie in mooresville instead and had a wonderful experience!
way better food options and fantastic customer service!
to be honest, i'm really disappointed.
also, i paid almost $11!!!!
i left a message, but no one ever called me back.
i guess wvi doesn't want my money!
this was completely unacceptable!!!
i will never go back to this place ever again!!!!!!!
they used tough chewy chicken on the chicken quesadilla.
i felt slightly nauseous after eating  it.
first and last time i go there!
and i am sure it wont be the last.
tonight my sister went in and picked up for me.
and of course nobody answers the phone.
in short, go anywhere else in the village.
falafel world just east of here is amazing.
i should have gone there tonight.
pizza maybe good, but delivery sucks.
wth does that mean?
i asked for an eta.
very frustrated.....and you can't order online.
what pizza place doesn't offer that?
the lack of service is enough for me to never return back....
after all its markham,  there are 100+ sushi bars...
terrible customer service!
never return phone calls.
do not recommend!!!
jesus christ almighty...
2 hours to deliver a pizza somewhere 5 minutes away?
i have a broken leg so i can't walk or drive there.
other wise i would because that's inexcusable.
worst fucking place ever !!!
the waiters are fucking rats & motherfucking gold digger!
worst fucking costumer service!
i rather starve to death than to come back!
the chances that they're going to delay your flight are pretty high.
my party would not have visited if it weren't for the coupons.
food was medicore and there weren't many selections.
spend your money and stomach space for better buffets in vegas.
this has to be the worst ghetto movie.
theater in las vegas!
location is great drinks were good but that's it
mugged and robbed at the pool....staff told me its not worth the time...
filled out a report.....
i find the contract to lack transparency.
the quality of work is very poor.
they rush to collect your money and move on to the next.
this will be my last visit and don't recommend this place to anyone.
save your money.
i want to also add that i see that they aren't very sanitary.
very disheartening from someone who i expected to have compassion for animals and customers.
had to take car back twice to clean wheels.
asked for "the works" and they didnt even wipe down the inside.
so out of here!
i used to love ghost armor.
unfortunately we got a used band-aid baked into the crust of our pizza.
we ordered two pizzas, of course they went straight in the trash.
unfortunately we had already eaten some.
you can't even imagine.
we won't be eating pizza again for a long time.
horrible service, i ordered the californian omelette.
dude couldn't give two shits about the fact neither thing served was an omelet.
is a rip off.
the teachers are not on par with yoga instructors elsewhere.
they are not even remotely fit.
the classes get cancelled willy-nilly without announcement.
their students are people who don't know better.
this place is so average!!!!
i don't understand.
the service also sucks.
do yourself a favour and go to una or blaze pizza.
he said "ooh yeah that wouldn't be good....
i had an awful experience today at hooters.
this was the first time in my life i've never left a tip.
one of the worst restaurant experiences.
waiter snatched a menu out of my friends hand.
please do not come here.
food was mediocre and the waiter should not be working in the service industry.
i got a second opinion from american home water and air.
american said they charge around $200.
i was also told most ac company's pay their employees by commission.
so the more they sell, the more they make.
i will never use penguin air again.
i really wanted to try this place.
she was a loyal customer and said she never had this happen before.
needless to say we will be finding a better southern restaurant.
i gave this place 1 star because of the materials they stock.
they have pretty much anything one needs for steel stock.
that said, the customer service is appalling.
this was the second, and last time i will spend money here.
the tempura was good and the sushi was ok, for the valley.
did i buy anything from here?
no. do i plan to?
go somewhere more professional and save yourself the trouble.
this is the most unprofessional lab i have ever seen.
staff complaining about other staffs work ethic in front of patients.
three people at the desk waited 10 minutes and was never acknowledged.
they could not find her records.
they could not find her orders.
just sad i will never come here again
don't rent here, seriously.
every review here is on point about this company.
this place is a rip off, cheap products, high prices and terrible service.
like wow you're so cool working at a dirt bag smoke shop.
the food is passable.
the tv was blaringly loud to hide the lack of customers.
but the service really capped it off.
seems like they learned their service skills running yard sales.
i wouldn't go there again if they gave me the restaurant.
the only good part of the buffet was the chicken 65 and goat soup.
the plate was hot but the actual food was not.
i'm sure it's a decent park but as a baseball player the fields suck!
oh and the grass is brown and covered in weeds...
this field needs some love asap.
horrible customer service.
impossible to talk to a human.
we will never go to this location again!!
not reviewing the food as i've never had it but how they conduct business.
they act like they have no idea what we were talking about upon calling.
i had a horrible time here.
they say us at a table that literally gave me a headache.
i won't ever go back.
i finally got around to trying to use it.
i was given no solution, no apology, nothing.
out of luck, too bad, i guess!
so, avoid buying gift cards here; the chances of them honoring it are unknown.
zero help solving the issue from any of the staff.
lastly: it reeks like bo in there, someone should get the carpets cleaned.
came across curry pot in the food court.
worst decision ever to eat chicken here.
do not recommend & will not return.
also, was hard and dried looking on the outside.
these guys need to learn how to cook.
that's horrible to be preparing food like this!
what a waste of money!
very disappointedsee my yelp pictures for evidence of dryness in the chicken.
minute clinic review: wish i could give 0 stars.
one of the worst chipotles you could possibly go to.
my burrito bowl was so below average, that i just threw it out.
disgusting, thanks for breathing all over it.
anyways, just seriously dont go to this chipotle.
the guac is not good either and youll be so disappointed.
and it never got delivered because they couldn't find the address.
what a monster!!!
what an absolute shame!!!
not a relaxing experience at all.
i have found an amazing eyelash artist named rachel at eyeconic on rainbow.
check them out.
i bought a new bed from them.
it was cheap and flimsy.
i waited over a month and finally had to shlep it down there myself.
then the very rude woman couldn't even process the refund.
i had to wait for that too.
don't be that fool.
8th tees lakes just had their grass cut.
if the new groundskeeper is responsible, what is his excuse.
he says he is always available but no contact info to wake him up.
tacky looking establishment and terrible service.
is this place a joke?
there are better places nearby.
ugh this place is the worst.
dont get me wrong, the show is amazing...
saw it a couple years ago, and it was wonderful...
horrible horrible experience and i will certainly not be patronizing the mirage ever again.
it was so bad i did not eat it.
i had to just through it out, what a waist of money  $17.20.
i will never go there again.
i found this place from yelp, the rating was great.
we got the table, got water and order placed.
40 minutes passed by, i started to get really frustrated.
another server came and asked us to confirm our orders.
i could not believe what i just heard...
food was decent but the service, big question mark...
this is unfortunate..bit into a bone in my chicken sandwich.
should've had a burger maybe but i don't believe i'll be going back.
either learn your product or stop lying to sell cars.
talks a lot about how good she is, good people don't need to.
this hotel is terrible.
everything is old and run down!
carpets are dirty and the shower requires shower shoes.
otherwise, don't stay here!!!
my rental was confirmed for $89 and change.
i signed a receipt for the same when i picked up the car.
i was charged $235.58 for no explained reason.
the desk staff was rude when i picked up the car.
simply the worst rental car company ever!
it's not worth the inflated price.
my review is for the rocky river location.
i paid a lot of money to get my hair cut.
my cut and style was maybe 12 minutes long total.
total rip off.
i would not recommend coming here to get your hair cut or styled.
so disappointing, the dessert was better than all there food.
this buffet is on the 24 hour buffet pass.
what a waste of time.
if i could leave 0 stars i would!!!!
my $30 gel polish lasted all of 2 days before chipping!
this place cares nothing about their customers so disgusting.
avoid at all cost not worth the money that you pay.
will never return!
only came because my favorite salon is closed on sunday.
won't be doing anymore shopping at this location , that's for sure .
the service was really bad and the food was not even good.
went with another company for only $77.20.
if i could rate this location less, definitely would.
i ordered a large watermelon slush with jolly ranchers.
which my 4 year old nephew is very allergic to.
thank goodness he hadn't yet taken a drink.
i am so very furious and i will never return to this location.
absolutely nothing for people lactose intolerant or non meat eaters.
super unhelpful staff trying to find something, anything on the menu to eat.
super expensive to get a 1/8 cup of strawberries for 2.50.
overall terrible experience.
the only reason i checked one star is that there is no zero!
this company is dishonest and deceptive!
then they added $13 a day for my husband to be a driver!
i have never had a rental car do that!
do not rent from this company.
they will overcharge and deceive you!
my first and last time here.
came here with co-workers for breakfast.
we had to call the host twice and remind them we're here.
ordered my food an hour ago and still waiting...
this course is way overpriced for what you get.
or just over $12 a hole!?
we-ko-pa is $60 cheaper and 100% better, especially the saguro course ..
a cliff bar cost me $5 at the turn..
they act like more like douchebag bartenders than professionals.
it's disappointing to watch people take advantage of the less fortunate.
one wonders how many transfers came from this walgreens pharmacy.
get your meds filled at your own risk.
do not stay here.
it's 2am and it's impossible to sleep.
long repeating horns.
over and over and over.
pathetic..closes on super bowl sunday....what restaurant is closed on super bowl sunday?
that's the day you make the most money!
not customer friendly!
my buddy picked up a pie this afternoon.
got their 16" pickup special, half pepperoni, half cheese.
i wouldn't waste your time getting a pizza from here.
that is if you value your time.
if you're in a hurry for a cheeseburger you might try another location!
not good at all!!
the crab legs were not fresh and cooked to hell.
so upset i wasted my money on this  buffet.
suck absolute ass.
after researching the company, i don't expect to see my package anytime soon.
jag och min sambo kte p vision holidays resa till grand canyon.
spendera era pengar p en helikoptertur istllet, vilket vi frn brjan hade tnkt gra.
our server was amazing and very friendly.
i find that very rude and unprofessional.
too expensive and slow service.
food went downhill quickly also.
what a joke service.
learn from our experiences and stay far away from this group.
no one go here.
the fat hawaiian with long hair is a chump
impossible to get someone on the phone to order for pick up.
was placed on hold two separate times indefinitely.
would not go here again even for free.
just took a day off work to get an oil change.
drove the 30 minutes home.
will definitely never go there.
because we didn't buy it from them!
we bought our motorhome for well over $40k less than they had theirs listed.
look elsewhere people -- you can get a much better deal!
i'd give zero stars if i could.
the fried rice and cashew chicken were very bland!!!
was hoping for better as we live close by...
very slow and poor service.
friend almost missed her flight because the food took over 25 minutes.
waitress still wanted to charge for the food that we never did get.
also tried to overcharge for our 2 drinks.
left next to no tip.
will never return.
also had a horrid experience at the crowfoot location a couple years back.
very poor service there as well.
get it together montana's :/
bad customer service.
goodluck finding a worker or a product in the right spot on the shelf.
you can only find workers at the checkout section.
especially with no workers ever around.
horrible experience and terrible customer service from nicole.
rude , and lairs!!
sent me a quote and the cost was not on it!!
then when calling them back to start auto ins.
the cost change's  now u see why the numbers weren't in the email!
f  u  flo
not impressed $74.00 for a conventional oil change and air filter.
staff not friendly waited 20min before they asked for my info.
only 2 other customer's there.
will go elsewhere
they're lucky i don't call the cops !
this has to be the most irresponsible business in the world.
if you value the cash don't use that machine.
or their business!
i have lost over $20 in cash because of this place !
we had ordered two burgers, one came with one inch sharp metal piece.
luckily, my friend did not get hurt from chowing down.
poor management, poor food safety awareness.
we purchased the redflagdeal coupon for pi-tom.
it was the worst restaurant experience even for the 'discounted' price we paid.
the mango salad is just sliced raw mango.
basil duck has 5 tiny pieces of duck that are mostly fatty duck skin.
authentic pad thai has shrimps that taste like rubber.
went here with a groupon coupon.
we ordered a kebab platter for the appetizers which was just alright.
both the chicken and lamb dish were disasters.
roganjosh was a tatal failure too with watery gravy.
nothing even close to indian food.
naan breads were alright.
wouldn't go back again to waste my money.
on my last visit, i was looking for ski clothing.
the beds are really outdated and their hours are awful.
the place is also really dirty.
the carpets are that old green and are stained.
i'm afraid to put my bare feet on the ground.
def don't recommend it.
customer service is terrible.
there are 100 customers an 2 registers open??????
customer service desk is a joke.
stand in that line for 45 mins just to get assistance.
prices not posted or prices don't match what is scanned.
bought chicken that was already rotten....gross!
i'll stick to safeway and sprouts
things didn't get any better here.
we wanted the same teacher each week.
she called in sick several weeks and quit.
after 18 months of lessons @$50 per half hour i gave up.
now, they charged my daughters card again after quitting.
they are going to "investigate" and have a manager call.
it's been 4 or 5 days and no manager call.
this place should just close shop.
they don't know the meaning of good customer service.
this location is terrible!
the employees have no idea what's going on.
today will be my last visit to this location.
went for dinner tonight.
will be last time icome here.
food took forever to be served.steak was warm, potatoes cold.
have never encountered that in any restaurant before.
needless to say not coming back.
we won't be back...
ordered chicken kebob and beef (chenjeh).
these people need to be held accoutable for their actions.
they had no right.
i hope they are investigated.
i've been to way better bars.
save your time.
went in for a basic wash, left with a repair bill over $500.
my whole experience was extremely disappointing from the front end greeters to the owner.
i hate dealing with unscrupulous people and businesses.
i had just come from work and had work i still needed to complete.
we ordered a tiramisu cake from vincent's for an 18th birthday.
what we got was definitely not tiramasu.
there were no lady fingers, it had no coffee liqueur, and was incredibly dry.
on top of that they misspelled the birthday girl's name on the cake!
and that we ordered the wrong cake.
omg where do i start!
that's twice now.
i think i am done.
i normally don't write reviews but i felt that i needed to this time.
don't waste your time.
this place is ridiculous.
i asked for a  pumpernickel bagel with egg white, spinach, and mushroom, no cheese.
understandable low star rating.
just left sweet basil with friends.
was introducing them to the lovely store and new restaurant.
it was obviously because the display was not put together properly.
she was told she had to pay wholesale cost for the plate.
upon checking out they charged her $20 for this small plate.
seriously marty this was a huge mistake on your part.
i have been a regular customer for years and am very disappointed in this.
booked a car for a 1:00 pm pickup.
their telling me they have no cars available.
this place is horrible.
if i could give this zero stars i would.
the only good thing about this restaurant is your seated right away.
service is bad & corn tortillas were hard as a rock.
managers was no help either.
never ever ever going to this restaurant again!!!!!!!
worst methadone clinic in the industry!
do not trust these snake ass fucks!
they do not care about their patients.
all they give a fuck about is money and screwing their patients over.
eat a fucking dick, all of you hoes!
we ended up at the bar - and waited 10 more minutes.
they messed up all three of our entrees and two of the three drinks.
i say they because all three people who served our table were rude.
i definitely won't be back.
i had the bahama mama with lamb and a side of zucchini sticks.
the burger was very disappointing.
the zucchini sticks were ok, but anything deep fried is usually good.
my friends ordered other burgers and all felt the same.
i definitely will not be going back.
worst customer service in years!!
hour to get a drink...
and the food was on it!!
no apologies for the reg priced happy hour caesars either.
manageress needs some career counselling!
oh well live and learn unfortunantly we will never be back!!
i give this place 4 thumbs down.
overpriced for the quality of the food.
wouldn't go back.
i'm writing this review purely on treatment.
right now," even as a potential customer turned quietly and walked out the door.
i watched the store clerk shake her head in disgust.
stopped in today to watch the jets/pats game.
couldn't believe she wouldn't accommodate us?
well done braswell's well done!!!
how is it that you can't compensate for traffic while knowing it's gonna happen!
therefore, you are not eligible for a refund!!!
im only giving a star because i can't rate them any lower!
nice job albertsons on ruining another great store.
no self check out.
takes forever to check out
this place is a rip off.
probably the worst mucho in the city.
so skimpy on toppings.
im puzzled right now.
my conduct of sitting quietly and waiting patiently to get proper service was misconduct?
i will absolutely not use this car rental again.
nice family business or should i say a family of thieves.
don't worry enterprise, what goes around comes around.
really disappointed in their customer service.
in addition, the side of peanut dressing provided did not really taste like peanut.
this was my first time eating here and don't think i'll be going back.
seriously, do not waste your time or money on this place.
they are horribly unorganized.
i should have read the reviews before wasting my time.
i will never purchase anything from these people again
looks like that is all i can expect from this company.
i had 3 large plants die on their watch.
we have since hired a contractor to fix the gate.
this repair cost is $200.00!!
do not use resi-fence.
place is a dump
the food was dry...
terrible experience all together.
food and service are both pretty bad.
we didn't even eat the food we got, it was so bad.
if i could give negative stars i would.
this hotel is the worst!!!
the rooms are dirty and the smell of mold is throughout the entire room.
he told me i needed to call orbitz who i booked with.
from rude employees to my coffee never being right.
i had my brand new cascadia towed to their shop two days ago.
they had just opened and the truck was still in troubleshooting.
he rudely said "well, have a nice day then, sir" and hung up.
this person has no customer service ability whatsoever.
went there 7-19-16 ..
called to get pricing and more information on a vehicle.
was rushed off of the phone and never called back with any information.
i called again and someone answered and then hung up.
no idea how the dealership has any customers at all?....
it's all about customer service.
the employees are just rude and stupid.
i used to shop at fry's quite a bit but not much anymore.
i'm tired of the staff and their lack of knowledge.
they act as if you're annoying them.
also, they never seem to have the items in the sale ad.
i now do my best to take my business elsewhere.
even major theater sound systems are off now.
found a premier movie going experience for the same price (crownpoint).
don't think i'll be hitting phillips place again.
found hair in cajun fries.
will not be back here again.
the food is edible, but overpriced.
delivery took over an hour and a half and the food was absolutely cold.
the phad thai was bland and dull.
maybe it was just a bad night, but it was terrible.
went there sunday nite .
the food tasted great although we were both sick the next day .
we had different meals ,so go figure .the seats are uncomfortable .
absolutely awful meal from start to finish.
while they provide decent sized coffee mugs, the content is subpar.
my friends' pancakes were laden with baking powder and had no flavor.
our server was attentive, but the food was just abysmal.
almost everyone felt slightly ill after eating.
i would recommend staying away.
truly i don't even know how they can still be in business?
run far away from ever entering this establishment.
rude and vulgar help with zero talent.
forget professionalism, i am certain that this is something that are not capable of.
today was no exception except i went inside to the counter .
and again i had to wait 25 min to receive my order .
they only had 3 employees working for a friday night .
one counter person , one drive thru person and one cook .
well once again i will not go back to arbys .
food sucks , over priced and under staffed .
had a horrific experience with artemano.
we live in ny and purchased our furniture on october 25.
we were assured that the delivery will be made in 3 weeks (max 4).
so to sum it up....
never go here.
they gave me a horrible gel manicure that peeled in a week.
so rude and unprofessional.
not worth giving them your money.
i went river star twice.
i went there 6 months ago.
the food was bad.
i went there again this evening, give them another chance.
again the food was bad, nothing like hk style food that i know of.
chicken is full of fat, sauce was greasy.
they put green papper, onion, pine apple in chicken satay soup noodle.
these things don't go togather.
they need a new chef for sure.
we tried this place both in the morning and afternoon and it was horrible.
all the food was poorly made and cold despite being under warming lamps.
unless you have a discount on this place, find somewhere else to eat.
it's not worth the full price tag.
other than at i've never had a good experience here.
expensive with little portions.
food was not good.
they are never busy...i can see why.
i bought a family meal and a whole chicken yesterday.
the chicken was ok but a bit too salty.
the side broccoli and pasta was spoiled.
i had to throw it out.
i don't recommend this place for a family last minute gathering.
next time we'll just bbq ourselves.
horrible customer service.
another terrible experience at a big burrito restaurant.
this is probably the 10th bad experience i've had at a big burrito restaurant.
usually it's mad mex, but this time it was kaya.
i walked in and asked for a table for two and a half.
it's funny because there was over half the room available inside.
avoid this dump.
i, and many friends, have been going here since they opened.
it's time to move on.
took my business to goodyear who beat the quote and got a warranty.
you guys need to train your staff on how to make coffee.
im moving onwow tried again..
i will never use this establishment for this reason alone.
watch out for rent a center trucks.
the drivers are horrible.
rude service staff!
note: monday evening, not too busy, but standard crowd, moderate noise level.
we were a table of 7 people.
there were a few waiters assisting each other to distribute food to tables.
the waitress who brought out our food was so disrespectful!
waited about 4 hours to tell me insurance won't cover it.
make sure you have an appointment when you go in.
expect to be there for a while.
depending on your insurance they will prioritize.
no rice and peas.
i made a reservation.
i had my valid us driver license, insurance, passport, you name it.
i even had my electricity bills on my tablet.
she said you must have the bill printed!
i don't know, maybe she was a racist.
don't come here unless you have all day to sit around and wait!
this is so ridiculous because it happens every single year i come see her.
they've deleted two previous negative comments by me.
do not shoot here, most of the people are arrogant and condescending
i ordered a remote garage door opener from north shore.
never had an experience like that with any other internet company.
what in the world am i supposed to do with that?!?!
i love supporting local business, but this was a terrible experience for mediocre food.
worst community owners ever.
so rude and disrespectful.
there's always loud music bumping, and kids running around screaming.
do yourself a favor and avoid this community.
honestly, just tell me if you don't know to make that drink!
had to send it back twice.
the tiger prawns were just small regular shrimp.
really disappointing visit for big taste.
worst service ever experienced!!!!!
very incompetent and rude staff for extremely average sushi.
and not that cheap.
let me start off by saying the ambience is a+.
i'm honestly shocked the food got such great reviews.
it's overpriced for subpar food.
i went with friends and we only deemed one dish acceptable.
do not be fooled by these reviews.
would give 0 stars if i could.
i would never rent from this company again.
i strongly encourage you to go with another company.
i usually go with national but tried payless in an attempt to save money.
go with whoever you want, just not payless.
should have trusted our instincts when we drove up
anyway, this place was packed at 11:30 on a monday morning.
they should really consider rearranging the lineup and adding some more seats.
there's only one small bench for a hundred people.
i do not recommend
unfortunately, i think those days are behind us now.
we had them wash & wax our vehicle.
also, cleaned the windows.
yes, that's highway robbery!!!
not pleased with the sneaky upsale.
i haven't had nails for years and i wanted to treat myself.
i wanted acrylic but apparently "acrylic" sounds like uv gel with shellac.
it wasn't until i paid that i knew exactly what service i had received.
the quality and taste is not so much here in az.
what struck me the most was the upkeep or lack of at this location.
i was disgusted eating here.
the tables were dirty and the floor was worse.
the county health dept needs to degrade this ant infested pizza shop.
the cheese was gray and not melted.
the sausage tasted like it had freezer burn.
i recommend to drive into the city of pittsburgh and eat at mineos.
worth the trip.
ordered chicken alfredo , with a side salad gyro and a capri salad.
2 cheesecake slices for dessert.
total for our food was 44.00.
had the food delivered.
paid by credit card which cost another dollar.
the food was marginal at best.
racist white nightclub(just a few of the many).
black people boycott this place.
lets watch this place fall while we africans build our own.
absolutely the worst sandwich i ever had.
all for $8  are you kidding me?
don't bother with this place!
ah, cox (aka cocks) why do they even bother quoting prices?
they are going to charge whatever the fk they want anyway smh.
kiss ass wankers!
i'm assuming my expectations were a bit high, reading previous reviews...
i exepected tostilocos...
aside from that they're expensive...
we kindly stopped, shook our heads, and made a b-line for the door.
the closest occupied table was no less than 5 tables away.
the smell was horrible.
and not deliver.
read all the other posts.
good luck vegas is an awesome place to work.
i would give zero stars if i could.
i have had my teeth cleaned without taking x-rays before...
a bunch of lies.
seriously i am surprised no one has sued them yet.
they have very high service fees and do not offer a seating chart.
it smells like cigarets and beef jerky and the security guards here are mean
we recently hired them to do an event.
they are extremely unprofessional and can not be counted on.
sad too everyone was looking forward to trying their food and leaving positive reviews.
hire another food truck that doesn't recant on a verbal agreement.
visted this establishment once.
unfortunatley both visits rendered an undercooked pie with a burnt bottom.
i dont mind crispy food, or excessively dark edges.
this pie was doughy and chared as was the bruschetta.
save your self the dissapointment and try something else.
would give zero stars if i could!
nothing was any different other then the fact we now had wet carpet!
do not use this company!
this is the worst place ever!
go anywhere but here.
they work off quantity not quality!
they lied made promises they could never keep.
when we arrived to fresno they had no representative.
the main office was incredibly rude and unhelpful.
i will definitely use another airline.
this company is not worth the 40 bucks you save.
it is hard to make southwest look good but this airline did it.
now i'm not so sure i will recommend this place to people anymore.
not coming back here for awhile and not recommending it to anyone either
worse buffet i have had.
the only good part was the dessert bar.
food that was out looked like it had been out for hours.
service is extremely slow!!
like painfully slow.
food is mediocre at best.
i don't recommend this place to anyone.
time for another one-year boycott.
i recently gave them another try and what do you know!
they got my order right!
not so tonight.
either their workers are deaf or they just don't care.
either way i won't be back for at least a year.
good luck staying in business with this kind of help, shmucks.
upon speaking the restaurant they didn't care.
to do a carry out order, you have to go to the bar.
i waited about 35 minutes for a hamburger.
no offer of a glass of water or anything.
the burger was ok.
not as well done as i had asked.
no napkins in the bag.
the workers were cordial, and they work fast.
however, you won't get the advertised price.
the advertised price was $89.00, when the reps arrived.
i will never come back and hope you have a better  experience....
the drink  was strong though....
i would  rather  be car jacked then ever use this service  again
we will never go back to this mimi's what a bad mistake.
seems they need new management.
i made the mistake of calling them prior to checking yelp.
made an appointment and they never showed up.
tried calling them and their voicemail was full.
it's quite shocking that this company is still in business.
it took almost two hours for the girl to go through our stuff.
its nice to know that they value their customers time....
we won't make that mistake again.
this place is a rip-off!
do not get a wellness plan.
absolutely horrible practices.
they take advantage of people who care about the well being of their pets.
nope, not that great.
for a $1.75 for a very small taco, not worth the price.
everything here is actually overpriced!
cause you might get food poisoning.
eh. i would ratehr go to another taco place down the street.
customer service is poor as i said in prior posts.
come on let take care of regular local customers.
image the tip if service was average or great!!!
horrible barber shop.
chicago(barber) charged me $40 dollars for a combover.
just because it was a sunday.
i had just showered prior and had lightly applied pomade.
she gave me an unnecessary hair wash.
horrible side fade and didn't want to give me a lineup.
don't recommend this barbershop!!!
i went to ent.
asked the price paid it in full.
my advise is to stay clear from this place, or rip up money.
they lie and having it done correct in july by va.
this was the third time we took my son for a cut here.
first time was after it first opened and the cut was horrible.
fast forward to after washing it.
unbelievable service here from the staff, completely ruins the experience and wasn't cheap
how do you screw up cake and frosting?
lthe waitresses are very unfriendly, rude and very pushy!
even we did not have source for our bbq.
and man are they stingy with their corn!
waste of time and money.
in the past i spent  about $500.00 here a month.
he made no other comments to me or anyone else.
this seemed very strange..
not a very impressive location.
apple should send a secret shopper here.
the store was a mess and we had 3 people approach us.
we told them that we were there to buy a computer.
asked a few basic questions, which no one could answer.
room temperature water in stinky glasses should have been the sign ...
no bread delivered or offered ...
caesar salad was average at best ...
nobody asked how the meal was ...
assistant waiter came over and took my salad before i finished it!!!
staff does not care and i won't be back.
i was with salesperson in framing area for about 15 min.
salesperson dropped me like i hadn't even been there.
horrible service and the food was mediocre.
the servers did not know much about vietnamese food.
they also didn't know what kind of meat came with what dishes.
poor knowledge about their own dishes and what they're serving to their customers!!
pho broth was decent but the meat was hard to chew and  swallow!
i am very disappointed in this place.
never go here
this place sucks!
i would rather chew broken glass then use this place again.
fifty percent of my delivery order was wrong.
they didn't seem too surprised.
driver said"that's what they gave me."
worst nail place i've been to.
i decided to get a full set of acrylic.
save your money.
this place seems changed.
the pricing was not bad either.
if you're looking for a good breakfast, look elsewhere.
there are plenty of good options in the area.
they have 5-6 menu items that are about as basic as it gets.
all of the good menu items are only available once a week.
they should also look to change their name to matt's small breakfast.
save your time and go somewhere else
what a joke!
i just couldn't wait and have these clowns work on my car.
left and went to location on 12th st / northern.
this place was terrible!
i decided to be adventurous and try a new place, big mistake.
save your money!
been waiting since march 2017 and still haven't received what we been promised!!!
the store is beautiful and immaculate but the customer service is awful.
not one of the sales women greeted, smiled, or even acknowledged me.
i waited around for 15 min and was dismayed by the lack of friendliness.
come on people, you are not rob and stucky.
wait, they went out of business.
constructive criticism, take it and learn.
it's all about the paycheck!
when i first here...first impression: unfriendly.
the greeter when you walk in doesn't smile.
member services...is slow!
i need to cancel my membership and ask for my money back.
starbucks should come in and shake the place up.
feel trapped in amber while waiting in line.
assholes at this store!!
i purchased a car from weston dahn of dahn automotive via ebay.
he claimed the car was in 'immaculate' condition.
more importantly, he claimed all scheduled maintenance had been completed.
upon taking it to a local shop, they found numerous other neglected maintenance items.
ontrac deserves negative stars - they are horrible!
amazon, you should be ashamed of yourself for doing business with these characters.
if amazon continues to use this service, i'll go elsewhere.
not a good repair, i would not recommend at all.
materials felt cheap and flimsy and found out there is no warranty.
this was causing the screen to break.
the stuffed-baked lobster used to be amazing here.
today it was rubbery, flavorless and tough to eat.
hard-to-cut-even-with-a-knife lobsteris either over cooked or not fresh.
i had wanted that potato!
nice as can be...
but food and touching my food were unacceptable.
looks like i'll be looking for a different place for seafood.
ordered online for pickup as i was in a rush.
that was at 115pm didn't get my order until 155pm.
food was just average.
would not go again or recommend
they asked us to fill out an online form for quote.
i was at the house, no one showed.
plus i have video motion sensors that shows no one came.
what bunch of crooks.
really, what is a mexican restrurent with no chili relleno's?
an over grown taco bell.
very disappointed that this location doesn't have any chili rellenos today.
i know robertos has chii rellenos all the time.
this place is terrible!!!
we are visiting from out of town and my husband needed a haircut.
so we decided to give this place a try.
my son and i waited in the car.
well we were wrong.
why would you let someone wait?
common curtesy would be to have said that the moment my husband walked in.
this is an awful hotel posing to be something it isn't.
i wanted to try a different place than my usual and was sorely disappointed.
overall, i found that they were rude and had poor customer service.
they lost my business solely on that front.
we stayed here in march and couldn't believe it was a sheraton!
there was a bedspread stuffed under the bed and the safe was broken.
would never recommend this hotel to anyone.
front desk staff and room service people were great...
do yourself a favor.
buy a can of lachoy chinese...separate the two cans...
open 'em pour 'em in a pan and heat 'em up.
that's what they do and you can save 10 bucks.
worst customer service ever.
there was one customer in front of me and one staff member serving him.
ten minutes later it was still there.
one woman cleaned everything in sight rather than serve customers...
and everything was already clean!!!
worst food ever i have tasted !!
the owner  is a really stupid n rude person.
our laundry room light switches and a lot of outlets do not work.
i am appalled at the quality of service i have received.
charges for repair never made.
definitely would not go here for the taste of their food.
menu has a bunch of interesting sounding food but then tastes not so great.
wont be back again.
then we asked for a manager she said no one here sorry.
i'm currently writing this review from the jewel of the crown, eating.
had a coupon so i decided to try this place.
i had 2 suits dry cleaned and one was ruined.
there are now several indents that i cannot smooth out.
save your money and go somewhere else.
stay away from this place unless you want your clothes to get ruined.
the lady said okay and let out a huge sigh.
the owner would not send someone out unless we paid $149 service charge.
what kind of business are they running after waiting all this time, very unprofessional.
paid $42 for 2 large pizzas with 3 toppings each.
we ordered on the phone for pickup, and there was no itemized bill.
i was extremely disappointed.
my friend had reserved a large party for after her wedding.
we show up later than the rest of the guests but no biggie right?
a waiter greets us with "you can't sit there".
then he starts discussing something with his coworker..
they both confused and upset.
like me and my family had committed some kind of unspeakable thing.
the rooms are nice but my property was stolen from my room.
1 wacom tablet and mouse1 button down shirt (yes a shirt!).
not good times.
this is not a comment on the service.
i used to have time warner, and i would say cox is comparable.
but cox's pricing policies are absurd.
nothing has changed.
what justifies this?
1 star for the soda that was the best thing i had here.
the asada taco didn't have no taste, and the pork taco was burnt.
the cashier was rude.
love the the resturant ,but the service sucks!!!
get more help or you will lose your customers.
wish i could give it less than a star.....the worst!!!
we were sick the entire day!
guess they were plotting their escape.
haha -- joke's on me.
this is probably our favorite sushi restaurant in town...date night or with the kids.
we tried to go tonight and were overwhelmed by the smell immediately.
it was so strong i was getting nauseous.
we got up and left once the bartender excused the smell on the kimchi.
i told him it smelled like a sewage leak and was not being dramatic.
his smug attitude had us walking out the door for good...
really basic, bit too tired looking for comfort, especially the ground floor!
upstairs is a bit more comfortable but...
cardinal rule should be that you treat your customers like paying guests.
i think not.
i understand they have a beverage service, coulda fooled me.
2 hour layover, decided restaurant instead of a bar..
just wanted something simple, ordered chili cheese fries and a beer.
fries were cold, and flavor was not that of chili.
poor service, horrible food!
go elsewhere while at vegas airport.
first, the service and creme brule was excellent, but that where it stops!
my wife ordered the 10oz prime rib so we could share it.
i doubt it was was 6 oz and had no flavor.
i ordered the lobster tail and was not prepared well and mushy.
try anywhere else!
i'm finding that most the food in the flamingo was mediocre at best.
gave her nothing but a hard time.
finally getting my daughters braces off today.
i would highly recommend going to any other orthodontist in town.
i got a second opinion elsewhere and it was the best decision i've made.
had to go to 1 star.
pizza has been awful and i don't know what happened.
sorry rosatis but i need to find a new pizza joint.
this place was horrible.
they sent him home in pain!!
now they discovered that he needs surgery.
needless to say, my sister is filing all kinds of complaints.
i think it's safe to say i'm not coming back.
service here is horrible.
i have tried this place multiple times, just in case of an off night.
very bad puzza.
asked for no green peppers after a long wait here comes the puzza.
green peppers all over it.
answer...that's how it comes.
tried to pick off but still tasted like papers anyway.
meat was poor quality and cheese was old.
will never go back.
alone in a hotel with my 17 year old son.
he became sick at 11:30 at night.
i wasn't sure if he could even walk through the lobby without throwing up.
i found this dr. on yelp.
i left two messages, his voice mail said he returns calls within 10 minutes.
it's been nine hours and he still hasn't bothered.
do not count on him to be reliable.
i would give 0 stars if i could.
this place is terrible.
never going back there.
ordered five french toast sticks, got 2.5. thanks for stealing my money scum bags.
she didn't even say "hi, how are you" when i sat down.
don't go here.
first and last time i eat here.
i went with my husband and the waitress was so rude.
she kept forgetting about us and the place wasnt even full.
she gave us our bill and expecting a tip!
fuck this place
just a bad experience overall.
this mall tops my "never again list." confused and obnoxious tourists everywhere.
this place is below par.
my people and i are moving to another lot.
i'll be back but will give it some time
this is like the walmart of gyms.
it is poorly run and the clientele is quite diverse.
the equipment is not well-maintained.
and, in the group exercise classes rote oriented and repetitive in nature.
it's an interesting concept but not the right fit for us.
she called us broke multiple times and was incredibly demeaning.
i will never consider going back and would not recommend it to anyone.
absolutely terrible service.
traffic can be kinda tricky if you want to do drive-thru during peak hours.
a mix-up with his payment occurred right afterwards.
needless to say, things got preeeetty heated.
after waiting 2 hours for delivery the driver dropped off the wrong order.
tried calling and i got hung up on.
drove down there and demanded a refund.
i was told the credit card machine was down.
we will see if i get a refund.
where shall i begin, the server came up right away, which is great.
we got our food in this humongous plate.
wine in a plastic glass?
then all of a sudden she disappeared.
$27 for a little piece of steak, not worth it.
at least when it came time to get the check she was very attentive.
won't be back.
by the way clean up your restrooms that's disgusting.
i would avoid this place, try some better fun place down the street....
if you have all day to wait this is the place to go!!
always there to make you wait as long as possible.
most reliable wait times.
never fast always slow guaranteed.
so come on down and hang out at discount tire.
they are terrible here.
i always wait an hour.
one of the docs or pa's, eric has zero personality.
i am looking for a new provider.
old lao food.
i dont recommend this place.
would never come back here.
very disappointed after driving from gilbert.
i was really looking forward to this meal too :(
the worst food and service on the strip.
the food came and it was cold.
the manager did not care at all and did nothing to remedy the situation.
we paid for the terrible food and left.
no, just no.
that is all.
waited 5 minutes and walked.
this place is terrible!!!!
they make you wait outside in the heat because the place is so small!!!
all this outdoor seating and no mister system!!!
menu is very limited and you cannot separate checks!!!
terrible, just terrible!!!!!!!!!!!!
i stayed here a few nights ago and had major issues.
she was extremely rude and very condescending with her replies.
just for a box!
horrible horrible service
the wait times are ridiculously long.
went downhill since it was fremont medical.
cannot say anything bad about staff but 4 1/2 hours there says it all
unbelievable poor service.
cashier screwed up order.
i asked for straws from the wait staff and they returned with one.
there were literally six of us sitting there.
i then said i need 5 more, he returned with 4.
i then asked for 1 more and he brought the sack of straws.
it seems like the entire store staff was ran by 12 year olds.
we are finished eating here.
the food was typical tasting for panera.
i been here since 1999 n never had a problem until today.
nick told me he wasn't going to do anything for me.
i drove 20 minutes out of my way for the poorest customer service.
the manager nick is a complete asshole & a very poor manager.
i got my hair done here in december 19th for my wedding.
making my hair look even worse.
i heard so many good things about regis salons, but i will never return.
absolutely love this place!
but won't be coming back unless something changes.
so sad :(
i'm really disappointed about the customer service.
the server is really rude and gave customer bad attitude.
waiting time good.
our party ordered 3 burgers, two medium, one well.
all came well done.
they were all very dry and bland.
not one of us enjoyed the meal.
i ordered a chicken slovakia and a poutine.
the first bite was a chunk of very undercooked chicken.
the poutine was inedible.
i had one bite it was over salted and tasted like pure grease.
the worst customer service i have received in my life.
our chicken manchurian and chili chicken tasted the same.
the chow mein was extremely spicy, almost inedible.
when told the server about the food, he argued to make his point.
we waiting 25 mins to get ice which is kind of ready made.
i went on a recommendation and was deeply disappointed.
the absolute worst place.
consistently bad food and even worse service.
today i purchased the "watermelon lemonade" which was 6oz for 4$ and was spoiled.
it had a sour rotten taste.
i'm done with this place.
8/10 times i've gone in, it's been bad service or overpriced crappy food.
not going back here ever.
the chinese food are not authentic at all.
the food is not very fresh.
the flavor is also not very consistent!
unfortunately- looks like i'll be skipping this restaurant for a while!
ridiculously over priced.
fruit cup was 2/3 filled and cost 7bux.
even starbucks is cheaper..
now they have to verify that the car is insured.
my first and last loan with wellsfargo.
they have been a headache since i bought the car.
i am seriously thinking of finding another bank to refinance  with.
if i could give this shiphole less than one star i would.
this place is only out to take your money.
that's all they care about.
they just want your money.
check your bill before you pay..
they overcharged me for my hair cut and pedicure..
i think she is the one that's in charge of the salon..
she charges me more than $30 extra for my shampoo..
never come back
this place was meh.
don't believe i'll be coming here again.
i was seeking a 'real' pastrami sandwich....not prefab, out of the package faux stuff.
this appears to be a deli ,but my sandwich was disappointing.
the people are  nice enough, the place clean.
it is difficult to get to unless you're headed to uptown charlotte.
i probably won't return.
went to get a mani today.
salon was closed.
for a month.
who does that?
so crazy to close your business for almost a month.
i ordered a chicken blt and there was no bacon or tomato.
wendy's always does this.
i am so tired of it.
not only that, the drive thru took about 20 minutes.
i just has the most unpleasant experience in this outlet.
i waited 15 minutes to pay!!
this place sucks balls!
supposedly closes at midnight yet they proceeded to usher us out at 11pm.
never asked us if we wanted anything to drink.
i'll leave it at this since i could go on and be brutally honest.
no wonder nobody was here on a saturday night.
it was a saturday night at 8:30, maybe 15 other parties sat inside.
okay, so i just got water to start.
mind you, the menu isn't that big in the first place.
my boyfriend wanted the turkey melt but they didn't have that either.
what kind of restaurant is out of half their menu on a saturday night??
will not be back.
not professional, too much papers in this digital world.
very old school.
the interviewer did not seem to understand the tax form at all.
it's really a shame!
the worst customer service experience in a doctor's office!
well, they wouldn't see him without a notarized letter.
his appointment was at 8:40 and i was talking to these people at 8:28.
such horrible customer service and experience.
we will never go there again after being treated this way.
there are many other dermatology offices we can go to.
las vegas dont tell mama....
half a star.....
dead and alive!
we got out of the restaurant even before we could place an order.
that is how i received my order in correctly.
the quality of my drink was totally bad!
i liked to come here.
but now i change my mine.
i will not come back!!
finally left out of frustration without eating the burned omelets.
not planning a return visit.
horrible experience and more embarrassing because we had brought out-to-town guests with us.
they handle their students like cattle ranchers.
but it wasn't.
schools like mcc are reasons for-profit schools are worth the price.
i ordered a blue cheese salad with boneless wings.
the 'wings' barely contained chicken and instead were 95% batter.
my server also had zero concept of time, or how to refill drinks.
the food here was not good at all, and the service not much better.
this has to be the smallest dunkin' i have ever been in.
never never never use these a-holes!
do not use them.
you've been warned.
they never get my order right.
my receipt also says "chicago dog" so i can't return it.
this exact scene has now happened 3 consecutive times.
i am no longer going back in hopes something has changed.
i'm officially done with this place.
worst doctor i'm las vegas .
i only became a patient because my mother was a patient.
i was with her for about 10 years.
do not go here!
do not spend your hard earned money here.
they will take advantage of you.
i just spent 80$ again at another phone repair place to fix my screen.
that is how they (didn't) fix my i-phone 5s.
then, a week later the whole screen malfunctioned.
i would highly recommend taking your phone etc to i-accessories.
i will post pic of business card.
well jokes on me.
his food was ok other than they shorted him 2 bo rounds.
also didn't recive a recipt for the 3rd time.
bartender was rude and ignored me completely.
i left the bar once and he was really chatty with my wife.
never checked if we were ok.
he made a point to talk to every other person but me.
never will i go back!!!!
this bank needs to staff more bankers!
one banker at all times?!
the tellers are friendly but seriously...
please hire more bankers!!!!!
dirty and rude.
i went over to the tanning salon across the street and got amazing care!
american residential properties is horrible and unorganized.
they told me i was approved, excited for that.
then i called in the next day and they told me i wasn't approved...
not so great.
the hot wings were not good.
the flavor was bland and had hardley any sauce.
the person next to me had the thin crust which looked pretty good.
on top of it all it was a little pricy for pizza.
i would not recommend this place.
went to dc steakhouse  on valentine's  day.
the waiter left a little to be desired.
i received  a house  salad and some  of  the  lettuce  was brown.
i mentioned  that  to the  waiter.
told me he would  mention  it.
for the price it was not good.
i would  not return elaine
tuna sandwich was horrible.
dry tuna from a can and no flavor.
way too much bread and the top was burnt a little.
felt sick a couple hours later.
i just checked in in two suites for a week with my family.
worst experience ever!!!
not only does my toe still hurt it is also swollen.
worst experience ever
i really hate to give this rating.
very nice restaurant but both my soup and entrees were very bad.
pepper flavored pork dish i had was so overbearing with pepper and tasted terrible.
i think i need to go back and try a few other things someday.
extremely rude staff, except cassie.
the asian guy gives so much attitude and i will not be coming back.
theyre stingy af and all their items are overpriced
had lunch there yesterday, with my wife and son.
the buffet was not good!
everything was overcooked.
we were the only ones there and i understand why.
the pictures on this site are not accurate.
there were about 7 items and most were overcooked.
what a disappointment, because i had heard good things about this place...
i will not be returning.
the new staff is very rude and not helpful at all.
the fair skinned black lady is the only helpful person in the building.
i said the menu says something different he states that's it's old menu..
waited forever to be checked i.
i also have seen better sushi rolls in my life, the rolls were disgusting.
not to mention i spend nearly $50 on two cocktails that tasted like juice!
don't go here.
ugh i reeeeeeaaaally want to like this place but the service is horrendous.
staff not rude, just very inattentive.
i ordered an iced tea that never came, with four people in the place.
the food is good, but service is key with restaurants.
i wish the owners would read the multiple reviews with bad service.
i'll skip it next time.
the tacos were alright, again, very flavorless and the rice portion was laughable.
overall, very unhappy with our first time at wedge, we won't be back.
for the price of $45 this place is awful for seafood.
i enjoyed more of the non-seafood items.
i can't believe we didn't go to the wynn buffet.
absolutely the worst people work here!!!
i call him out on it and the man denies it!!!!!!
dynamite paving is a terrible company!
do not do business with this company!
they jack up contract prices by 50%.
my advice stay as far away as you can from these rip-off artists!
ordered a capastrami for delivery with the dressing on the side.
i informed them the latter.
very disappointing quality of food especially for the price.
very pricey for what they give.
i wont come back there.
i declined and she stated she couldn't book the appointment without it.
is this a new policy or a rule specific to this location?
she would not let me book an appointment.
i called the queen creek location and made an appointment with no problem.
location, location, location.
that is all.
only been there once, but yuk, what, and hello..?
(food, menu, and service) will prob give it another try.
worst mcdonalds in vegas!
bad service consistently and sloppy made food.
3 trys and still crap.
i am sure the hobo's panhandling outside could do better.
they seriously must go out of the way to fuck things up.
it doesn't even deserve 1 star but i don't have another option ..
the service is horrible!
worst place i been in.
there day time bartender , not the usual ...has no clue .
again very unprofessional.
we arrived for lunch and ordered the supposedly famous pizza.
it was the lunch special for $15 wtih salad.
the pizza arrived and it was slighly burnt on the bottom.
the cost $22.00 for the wine ouch!
our bill was $100.00!!
plus i like to do business locally when possible.
but this was a pretty ridiculous situation.
don't let the low price fool you b/c you get what you pay for.
you won't find out that you are screwed until it is too late.
plenty of other companies to choose from.
so i am posting again because i feel people should know more.
let's talk about the pools and hot tubs.
while they are modern there are problems.
the main pool was supposed to be heated during the winter...it wasn't.
the hot tub is never hot, or even warm.
the hot tub near the smaller pool does work.
can't even express enough how much i hate this place.
not up to code (at all..).
rain storm flooded elevators, pictures are worth 1000 words.
i have come here a lot and it's always been a great experience.
today after going through the wash i noticed my vehicle was still dirty.
he then went and stood by the manager for 10 min.
i give them no stars!
eek, nasty, nasty, nasty.
latkes - greasy greasy grease, do not attempt, spare your liver some life.
overall: everything was fatty, greasy and so was the majority of the customers.
you are what you eat after all, but methinks not!
do not fall for the timeshare crap.
but it's all bullsh#t.
not worth the price.
don't even try their banh mi. it was hideous.
6$ for a powdery bun and a thin thin thin slice of cha lua.
service was very slow.
first and also last time!!
i ordered a burger at 4:30pm on a wednesday.
i was told it would take 10-15 min but i arrived at 5:00.
he agreed and then asked if that was it or if i would tip.
its def marketed towards yuppies and executives.
you cannot foo-foo up mexican food and have it taste like real mexican food.
how bout cheddar cheese on my chicken nachos instead of feta cheese.
who eats crumbly cheese instead of melted cheese on nachos!?
worst over the phone experience.
i called and placed and order for 2 half chicken dinners.
long story short, i'm very upset with the service.
the price quoted was not the final price!
not  acceptable, feel scammed.
wont return and won't refer others.
ate there last night with my family and today my mother has food poisoning.
there are so many good restaurants in vegas stay away from this place.
we wanted to go to as many "top chef" restaurants as possible.
rick moonen should be ashamed to have his name in this place.
mediocre at best.
will stay away from this tire shop at all cost!!!
the wings and tots were served cold, it was not even crowded.
i do know how this place stays open.
the french fries are literally always cold .
fish filet was so old that i couldn't even bite through it .
i could've used it as a coaster .
i had to throw the food away .
i will not be back .
i stopped by today at 11:45am.
this place is supposed to be open at 11:00am and they are still closed.
osmow's should update their hours of operation.
too bland and lacked skills from the chefs.
waitress also did a disservice but not giving us any recommendations on the menu
what a zoo!
very sub par food.
definitely quantity vs.
wait staff was nice but never once refilled my sweet tea.
avoid this location at all cost.
if you need anything more than basic deposits and withdrawals, go to another branch.
go to the branch right up the street and you'll get completely different service
wish i could give this place 0 stars.
some of my fries were charcoal black.
my date got philly sandwhich...
it came with roast beef and not steak on it.
the philly meat was really tough and dry.
she was insulted by managment.
i can never walk in again.
its not the only game intown.
i am inthe service business also.
you have to be nice even when your not feeling it.
thats for poor business behavior
i visited this location on 3/8/2013.
the experience was ok.
(i personally prefer jason's deli which just happens to be around the corner).
the soup was great and the chipotle chicken sandwich was decent.
i will not be returning to this establishment..
needless to say i was quite upset!
as an instructor i can rent gear for students at any dive shop!
i will never buy anything from sports chalet again!
she was very unprofessional and extremely slow and dazed.
to the point where we just got up and left.
very unhappy with the service.
i think the five star reviews are fake.
i booked a ticket through them.
don't book from this company.
just stay away!!!!
probably will never ever return.
everyone in the diner was complaining.
avoid this place at all costs.
if you guys planning to pay by setting your card on auto payment.
make sure you don't do that.
because there are going to charge your card until you die.
no matter what!
their excuse will be "sorry, we don't do refund"...
they don't follow up with customers!
they don't do refund!
i am giving the one star only because the unit was clean and safe.
the staff was rude as hell.
yes, it was busy but she did not need to be rude.
i decided to try this place for lunch with some co-workers.
i called the manager back and he stated the prices were wrong, very unprofessional.
i paid 10 bucks for some fries and a shawarma.
i could've gotten the shawarma by itself and paid 5 bucks.
i guess the fries were 5 bucks.
worst dairy queen ever!!
if i wanted just ice cream, i would've gladly ordered a cone.
"ummmm no thank you" not from you!!!!
why is this place still open?
gave it another try yesterday( hoping it had gotten better) 6 on a sat.
night and the place is empty.
i'm the only customer!
should have been a sign..
waitress was nice.
ordered the singapore noodles.
for 9.95  a total ripoff!
routine on sunday is the boyfriend buys coffee.
he went here last sunday and ordered 2 large hot coffees.
guess we'll have to go elsewhere next weekend.
if i could give zero stars i would.
and i never ended up renting the car.
they screwed up my favorite salad - at least today.
if i lived closer, i would have returned the poor excuse for lunch.
the issue was that they undercooked the main ingredient - the pasta.
i've been sitting in line for 20 minutes and guess what?
it's like this every single time!
went in at 8:45pm.
if they weren't cooking over an hour before close, nothing was fresh.
i said no thank you and left.
why stay open until 10 if you can't steam vegetables an hour before close?!?
if you're looking for a harmonious counseling office with compassionate therapists, don't go here!!!
didn't listen well enough and talked about things i already knew.
said i had anxiety issues when i never once mentioned anxiety.
my daughter's female therapist was rude, matter of fact, and harsh.
i didnt see her smile once.
needless to say, we'll never return.
went today for lunch.
i've been here a few times and the service here is poor at best.
if the service were acceptable this would be a 3.5/5...
i ordered from here today for the first and last time.
i haven't had a delivery experience this bad in 3 years.
save yourself the time, energy, and money.
i'm so glad i got a second opinion!!
not true at all!
i will never use them again!!!
ordered butter chicken, saffron rice, garlic naan, samosa duo.
butter chicken was ok but that's hard to get wrong.
save your money and order from somewhere else.
the only thing that was decent was the salad.
if the signs for pharmacy hours state you're open until 9pm.
then stay dafaq open till 9 pm.
don't have the shutters down at 8:55 pm.
served ketchup packets for kids meal.
$80 for crappy overpriced food and drink
horrible service the employees were rude.
i just had to just walk out and left my things there.
it was my first and last time at that store.
ordered spicy but certainly didn't get that either- all around disappointing!
i have made the mistake of eating here 4 times.
each time had garbage food and garbage service.
i left hungry each time.
not the nicest thing to say to someone who's excited to see their baby.
don't waste your time or your money at this place!!!
now after 40 tries and 23 minutes later their line is busy!
one star just for the customer service we just received!
terrible, rude, incompetent people.
the manager there, amy, can't put in a simple groupon.
my back is raw!
i'll be going to massage envy for my next massage.
had a very upsetting visit to bar louie station square.
the service was very slow and the place was not at all busy.
the nachos are then sent back and return 20 minutes later and still cold.
phone number has been disconnected.
used to have really good food.
i hope they can recover and come back.
i was pretty disappointed with this place.
i thought from the good reviews that the pizza would taste okay.
i ordered a medium veggie pizza with a side of fries.
the fries were super soggy and the pizza was pretty flavorless.
the people working there are really nice though which is a plus.
overall, i wouldn't go back.
as you can see, have stayed away for 2 years.
stopped today because i really wanted a bagel.
line was 7 people deep and only one person working.
can't say it does not warrant more help.
i am so confused and sad.
they just couldn't do t hat.
oh well there loss!!
cheap price...excellent customer service out of honolulu and las vegas.
customer service via phone sucks!!!
hazel is very unprofessional!!
other then that this airlines is good.....
this was the worst service ever.
it was so slow and took about an hour or longer to get food.
not worth it!
the burger took the longest.
decided to give the place one more try.
unbelievably, i was the third car in line and waited 35 minutes!
i actually got out of the car and went to the front window.
finally a female comes and i tell her my concern.
i went to my car thinking never again will i come to this place.
avoid this car rental.
the worst customer service ever and so much sneaky upselling it is outragous.
talked to mgmt about overcharges, person named danielle and she was a snot.
terrible expereince...avoid this hertz location if you can....best of luck.
i call the next day asking if they can deliver my item first.
i am told that i am 15 in the delivery and they cannot.
they never showed up so i call them at 2:30.
they say that they went to my house twice.
funny how i was home all day and no one ever came.
plus they didn't call my cell number that the salesman put on the order#.
this place never seems to surprise me with bad customer service.
so yeah unless you want your babies to be sick don't bring them here.
he told me not to go anywhere else.
as if they were entitled to my hard earned money!
they lost my business when omar spoke with his false sense of entitlement.
you can be direct and pleasant at the same time!
i called and the girl ashely.
i think her name was...
what a joke of a company.
will never recommend these people to anyone.
they also told me it takes 30 days for records which is also illegal.
girl up front had hicky on her neck as well.
gross and classless!
patient care is .05 out of 10!!!
find somewhere else to go
unfortunately i only ever write really good or really bad reviews.
todd edwards was recommended by my home warranty company.
he has to order the part but should be in in about a week.
during his 10 minute stay he asked to use my bathroom.
he couldn't just wait??
so for $65 and 10 minutes, this company made out ok.
went in, middle of the afternoon.
only two tables are seated.
the next day, we tried the ihop on apache again.
it was morning and packed.
waited again for a while, no one came to seat us.
back to riverview.
won't be returning.
i tried to eat here and get a slice of pizza for lunch.
there was a special advertised in the window for 2 slices and a pop.
perhaps if you aren't serving slices, don't advertise them in your window.
love primanti bros but this location is terrible.
the service is absolutely awful.
waited 15 min after being seated without being served before i left.
not even drinks.
owners have very bad attitudes and customer service skills.
waitress was lazy and didnt look like she wanted to be there.
our food was overcooked .
she said just a moment and continued talking to them.
so i asked again after 15 mins i had to ask again.
all in all food was ok but service was really off today.
if you need a shuttle, don't.
"we cook everything in meat...
literally no vegetarian options.
staff was perfectly courteous, otherwise kitchen entirely unaccommodating.
well, it's hard to say how the pie was.
there was a group of people in the corner, the guys in fedoras.
employees, or just cool cats who know the secret word?
this place has horrible damn service ...
there are empty seats everywhere
i called this place sunday, november 8 round 8:00 pm to ask service.
the lady i spoke was very unprofessional, no manner, and rude.
if she own this place, she should stop the business.
if she is employe she is destroying the business with her unprofessional altitude.
do not go here.
the esthetician is extremely harsh with your skin.
she rushes through the treatments, and is very unprofessional.
they run a lot of deals on websites.
don't bother purchasing these.
just pay the extra money and go to a reputable place.
it's also very hard to make an appointment.
i had to call several times and leave messages before anyone returned my calls.
it is seriously disgusting.
i wore my socks in the shower because of the filth.
please trust me as an avid yelp reader...
this is what i brought for $7.
some tarter sauce with a little bit of fish sandwich.
this location is trash.
i can't eat this.
mcdonald's is cancer to the food industry
absolutely terrible service!
they broke the latch to my middle console.
they told me they would fix it, but continue to make excuses.
everyone just pointed the finger at everyone else.
i am extremely disappointed.
the car wash itself was terrible to begin with.
i paid for interior cleaning, and it wasn't even cleaned.
i would not recommend this car wash to anyone.
my wife liked place in the beginning but our last visit went bad.
she picked our two dogs and the counter girl said there was a problem.
the girl said one of our dogs was not playing nice.
we tried to get more info about this and got no where.
the owner will not respond to wife.
this place is a over priced joke!
we were regular faithful customers ...
until the remodel.
i loved stella's prior to that and would have recommended it to everyone.
you were treated like family.
waitresses were personable.
and our friendly waitress...
lost her job.
won't ever go back.
i don't know how does it get this high rank?
we should have seeked a second opinion before paying the high price betlyn's charged.
worst experience with this facility!
finally convinced my sister who attempted suicide to come to do a self-assessment.
because she's an adult has to willingly admit herself.
all they did was give her a list of outpatient therapists to call.
google would have been better resource than this place!!!!!
first of all, they give free movie tickets for people who write good reviews.
so, don't believe all you read.
i have been there several times and $ is their number one priority.
every time i go, they have a new tech in training.
they always push fluoride treatments (which are extra), and a million x-rays.
dr menna is the worst.
cleanings are always uncomfortable and different equipment every visit.
front staff is also very pushy.
i don't recommend this office at all.
was craving their soup.
i had it delivered to my hotel room after a long flight.
there was no spoon.
they chose not to make it right.
i would avoid this place.
they wouldn't open a checkout lane so i had to do self checkout.
these self checkouts are ruining everything and killing the customer experience for me!
they are a pain in the butt.
this place is horrible, the owners are so rude and just take your money!
place is horrible!
it wasn't even busy, so i'm not sure what the reason was.
the food was something that i could have easily made at home.
we got charged $0.75 for salsa that was offered to us.
excuse me, but you did not earn that.
this is becoming more and more common in this industry.
real estate agents fail at an astounding rate.
wouldn't do business with these folks if they were the last on earth.
i would just dodge this food court all together.
i walked in and then straight back out.
also, there was an attack in the parking lot involving a hammer.
i was patient number four that he operated on that night.
i felt that followup care was very haphazard.
i'm very unhappy.
we had to put our own tables together to accommodate our party of 8.
the service was very slow.
the server was forgetful.
the chicken california flatbread pizza gave my wife food poisoning!
your single burrito could cost you $15!
i had the steak burrito and the steak was so tough.
i had the pork schnitzel which was very greasy.
the whole experience there was terrible as usual.
i told my family i never want to go back there again.
the food was lousy but the service was even worse.
i had used dr merkin a year or so back.
i was pretty disgusted.
not this place.
boy did my waiter prove me wrong today!!
we had the worst service ever!
he kept passing by but would never come to our table.
i was so disappointed!
the food was awful!
too much fried foods and not much vegetables.
taste like any other bad chinese buffet.
not going back again.
stay away from this company!
60+ wait while other companies actually knew how to quickly do the job.
use any other company!
rude employees also!
omg they are so rude there.
i was very pleasant.
she was so rude about it.
even though i live next door, i'm not going back.
eh, the bartender we got was rude.
fun ambiance though.
i probably wouldn't spend any more of my money there.
always hate when people that are seated after us get food before us.
i give one star because they didn't charge us.
...if i was trying to schedule an appointment i would've called to do so......
complete waste of money.
don't bother going to this place to prepare for a test of any kind.
you are better off buying the books you need and studying at your leisure.
came here for lunch, portions were small.
took 20 mins to check out after eating because they were understaffed.
this place is just out to get your money.
they billed my insurance for both ultrasounds!
you'd be lucky to even get any pictures.
between the 2 visits, they billed me and my insurance company over $2300.
and that was after fighting with them and removing duplicate/incorrect billings...
if you can avoid this hotel, i encourage you to do so.
besides the rude customer service, they are unapologetic about their mistakes.
hope the management can get the nightmare people working there under control soon.
i wouldn't feed my dog this crap.
we had a salad and poor boy sandwich.
the service was terrible as well.
i didn't have time to wait today.
however, i doubt i'll come back.
see ya later theme.
the state store was happy to take my money.
call and they say it's just a policy.
what kind of business turns away people like that.
needles to say, my boss will no longer recommend them to anyone.
a crowd of angry guests.
totally unacceptable and another scam targeting locals.
avoiid the unfair business practice and stick with station casinos
found this place on yelp and thought i'd try it out.
should be open at 10 but here i am at 10:15 and they're closed.
thanks for wasting my time
wtf is this?
i ordered through skip the dishes and i got an empty hotdog.
it says in the caption it comes with "real canadian cheddar" and hero sauce.
bull shit how am i going to eat this?
waste of money
omg they are so rude it's ridiculous.
even on their customer service...
talked to a guy named fernando and he was mean.
have you ever had someone make you feel really dumb?
well if you get fernando he's the guy to ruin your day.
we went to enterprise and found a better deal with friendly staff!
happy to say we will not be returning to budget for car rentals.
yes, you will save some money but not worth the headaches.
they are terrible at returning phone calls and always have a bunch of excuses.
piece of mind when you are opening a location is so much more valuable.
fake chinese food!
don't order any noodle, dim sun and deserts.
the ice water is the only thing we like.
staff steered me toward a product.
i should have done my research.
the floor dents just sitting in a chair.
no help from store and they even canceled my warranty for spite.
you read that right health violations.
i suggest big wongs, it maybe out-of-the-way but is much better food.
have a rice day!
i asked for some extra raita with the biriyani and they charged me $4.
so not worth it.
we came to pick it up and it was not ready.
she lied and asked for one more week and still not ready.
this is a disaster and i am completely heartbroken.
save the heartache.
there were two other parents with unfinished prom dresses!
this kfc is in a lousy location.
the employees are poorly trained.
the whole place is skuzzy.
this was probably the worst service i've ever received from a nail salon.
i only came here because it's close to my house.
and my nails...
they're ok, just ok.
this place is, in a nutshell, awful.
the food is less than mediocre and extremely over priced.
the patio is nice.
but the beer selection is terrible.
not worth it even when you live around the corner.
worst service of any fast food ever...
more like slow cold food or no food.
& it's what's worse- employees tonight were rude, manager on duty spoke no english.
service was horrible.
need to teach servers how to turn tables, prebus, etc.
worst service i have ever had!!!!
i will never use this cvs again.
never go to the place ever again and wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
bar tenders on steroids have such a bad attitude and totally disrespectful.
i got food poisoning here after eating a pasta dish with shrimp.
i had to pull over and vomit to make the sick feeling go away.
i asked for basic insurance coverage, which is $25.
that doesn't mean roadside assistance is included, it means you're charging me for it.
the restaurant was half empty and many tables were waiting for their food.
after 30 minutes we left.
and the hostess didn't seem to care.
we won't be back.
hire adequate staff or lose customers...your choice owners of le peep!
food at this panda express was pretty disgusting.
low quality meats and very inconsistent quality.
is this place kidding me?!
$90 for lobster noodles?!
only a 3 pound lobster....
go across the plaza to harbor palace..
today was buy one get one free lobster..
such a steal!
your's truly puts this place to shame.
bad coffee and bland food...tastes prepackaged not fresh.
service was fast...
but can't make up for bad food.
trifecta was mediocre and eggs benedict was horrible...
not even close to inn on coventry's eggs mondo
right before dinner and the food looks like it is from yesterday.
fresh is not in the vocabulary.
don't ask for fresh food either because they refuse to do that.
will never come back to this location.
the adjustments are great, but don't sign any contracts with them.
you're better off going somewhere else.
4 star auto gets a negative 5 stars!
seriously, stay clear of this lot...he & it are bad news!
if your time is valuable do not call argus.
he told be he would start working on it the 16th or 17th.
today is the 21st and no response and no proposal.
save yourself the frustration and call someone else.
we went tonight after the regrand opening.
the atmosphere was really nice and the live music was great.
this should have been our first sign something was wrong.
our waiter continued to display erratic behavior.
he was either really overworked or high.
we will not be going back.
even worse the next time.
it's as if the homeless are here.
i even saw manager walk past him without telling him to get up.
does mr. puck ever look at the places that use his name?
had i noticed prior to ordering my soup i would have never eaten there.
when i arrived at this t-mobile store their was nobody inside except 2 workers.
they were looking down on their phones and didn't even greet me.
i had to talk to them in order for them to look up.
bad customer service.
do not come to this t-mobile store...it's a joke.
its a hit and miss here.
enough to say i will not be going back.
worst omelette ever!
eggs should never be brown.
my omelette was completely overlooked and dry!
tasted like sulphur.
giant chunks of leathery sundried tomatoes!
one giant glob of goat cheese in the middle!
atmosphere was pure chaos!
hostess was clueless.
they take wayyyyy to long.
they need more staff members or quicker people.
every time i come it's slow.
i'm not kidding, there was a whole line of people.
that would've made me hurry up a little.
we used this shuttle service last weekend to get to and from the airport.
the ride over was great.
he told us that it wasn't their problem and then hung up on us.
as a result, we got stuck with a $65 cab ride home!
the happy hour margaritas were so sweet that we had to send them back.
they brought us new ones which were better but still not very good.
the flames were the only wow about it!
i would not recommend it.
i went there last sunday for a car wash and vacuum.
it cost $14.99.
i was so disappointed.
the wheels were half cleaned off.
what the hell?
i could have washed my car in the drive way and saved the money.
this is not at all what i expected.
i've never used freddy's before and don't expect to in the future.
the worst service i have ever received!!
i will never come back again.
the food is ok, but the service really destroyed the meal mood.
by far the worst soup noodle i have ever tried.
we ordered the california pizza and taco topper sticks.
husband said that it looked just like the kids hair who cashed him out.
i would not recommend this place to anyone not even my enemies.
let's start this off with how they charge a 20% gratuity for group.
they are terrible with customer service.
will definitely not be going here!
do i even have to give a star?
in australia we call this style of dining yum cha.
firstly, they say the kitchen closes at 3pm, and we arrived at 2pm.
all of the girls working are very nice, obviously they don't do the cleaning.
i am always disappointed to see that ontrac will be delivering my package.
the latest delivery from them is the worst yet.
i waited all day and into the evening for my order.
i notice at 8:07 p.m. that they attempted delivery and no one was home.
second, no note stating they were there.
third, i can here them when they drive up.
they lied and did not even come to my house.
it is now the next evening and still no package.
their pastries are amazing yes...
their boss came out, this lady and she did not seem very happy.
she kept telling us we needed to order now, but we just wanted info.
this place has extremely bad customer service.
i really hate this place.
complete no show!!!
very poor service!!
might be a good business.
sadly never found out.
and she called me stupid as i walked away.
how about zero stars?
i have been without heat for 9 days.
numerous phone calls, time from work, promises, moved dates and still - no heat.
they could care a less,  unbelievably horrible followthru and customer service.
service was great.
but two of us got food poisoning.
very very poor service..
ordered a veg hakka noodles and it was tasteless, so requested for an exchange..
seriously a bad attitude..!
spoils ur dine in mood..!
really wish there was a negative star to rate.
bland flavored food.
one member of our party had hair in her food.
service didn't come with a smile.
the manager who came over to apologize was nice.
i will never go back.
you have to pay extra for a potty break after 6pm!
you have to pay extra for medication!
i'm a fair judge of what is reasonable and this place is not.
they lost more than a few customers today.
if i could give zero stars i would.
we ordered 4 pizzas and were told it would be 45-60 minutes.
at one hour we called and were told 10 more minutes.
at an hour and a half we called and were told any minute now.
it wouldn't have mattered if we had gotten "pizza".
instead we got something that made us all sick.
order from another pizza place, unless you like chewy dough and salt.
the nurses in the hematology lab (where the draw blood) are super nice.
the doctor on sight, dr.slaughter, was beyond rude.
disappointed with the store.
overpriced items, poor quality, and not much to offer.
it wa worth the cab ride to the mirage....at least we saw the dolphins
i let him open the door because i was out of time.
all the tables were taken but there weren't any line ups.
terrible customer service!!!!!!!!
i ordered some bagels and the flavor was okay.
i will never be returning because of the horrendous customer service.
they were really sarcastic and when asked basic questions, they were completely unresponsive.
like if you know how i feel, why would you say that?
horrible selection of food.
all international foods.
do not waste your time or money at this buffett.
you will leave hungry and disappointed.
worst experience ever and it keeps on haunting us!
we moved our daughter in to the district on apache in august 2015.
do yourself a financial favor, and look elsewhere.
what an awful store.
i got in my car and made a special trip here.
avoid this place!
pristine consistently services our water softening system and they are price gougers.
he did some anyway and he wrote up an invoice for over $500!!?
don't trust this company, their recommendations or anything.
they are money hungry and price gougers.
please don't let them take your hard owned money.
this was the owner i was dealing with.
clearly doesn't care about repeat business.
i cannot believe the service we got!!
the sushi was overall good but our waitress was awful!!
then another man came and gave us two lemonades that we didnt order!!
we ended up paying for 3 lemonades.
no tip, we left very unsatisfied...
i dont know her name but she's the one with dark blonde straight hair...
we were standing at the bar while waiting for a table....
as if no one could see them...
it's so unprofessional...
& a health hazard...
we took our drinks and told the hostess we changed our mind...
hope this brings light to what is happening behind the scenes..
they took 10 minutes before taking my order.
i wouldn't come back.
visited the store last week  after promising never to set foot in it again.
total waste of time!!!
will not be back to this location ever again!
i went here the other day based off of the reviews on yelp...
what a big mistake!!!
not to mention she damaged my skin!
i'll gladly go to ihop
i feel like i'm the only person who didn't like this place.
my sister is a huge fan and went with me to order.
i had the jade chicken.
i tasted her food too but i don't recall what it was--still bleh.
i'll stick with the 'berto brothers for my bad mexican food.
maybe i just don't like asian food?
don't expect anything but a miserable experience with these ameuter lenders!
run as fast as you can!
she described it as a place for "crazy people".
anyone who exhibits that kind of lack of empathy has no business working there.
it's disgusting and unforgivable.
i can't wait to move away from her.
she sickens me.
shame on you and your facility.
their next available appt time?
two weeks, unless i wanted a 9:30pm time.
it was lousy customer service all the way around.
this place wax horrible!!
sunday afternoon, not busy, service was horrible and food was horrible.
everything looks like deal when your reserve and prepay for your car online.
i was forced to except the price and get my day going.
i should of looked at everyone's reviews before i booked.
this was my 2nd.
my fianc received the most disgusting service before even entering the restaurant.
he arrived just before 5pm (opening time) and asked for a table.
customer service is always  number one.
if i owner that team , we'd start by firing the coach.
pittsburgh i will never root for you again.
it was bad 10 years ago, five years ago and a nightmare today.
worst customer service ever.
assistant manager chad was outright rude and condescending.
i won't be back.
burger was over cooked and both my friend's and my burgers were nasty soggy.
frys had no flavor.
she also forgot my friend's guacamole and also tried to charge him for it.
gave us attitude when we questioned it.
place is dirty and lame.
i'm officially done with this place.
a one star business will no longer get structured sentences filled with witty comments.
i think i have said enough.
just go down the street to office max or try your luck at target.
red devil in phoenix and i hear in the white mountains is awesome too.
$150 to change a name...???
how is this legal???
the whole flight cost was near $200.
so a 90% fee to change a name in a computer.
worst service i have ever received at any cafe rio location.
worst food ever!
will never eat at an outback again!
avoid this place like the plague.
poorly managed and run!!
horrible customer service!!
a joke really!
had worst buffet experience ever.
the restaurant need to ensure that they serve hot and fresh food.
usually, in buffet, one or two dishes are not tasty and that's ok.
but today, all the dishes weren't tasty.
they kept on playing old music videos on tv, which was very frustrating.
overall nightmarish experience.
literally and honestly the worst car wash i've ever had for $18!
i'm honestly in such disbelief as to how filthy my car still is!
it's not like i went through with a bunch of mud on my car!
just normal dirt from vegas weather and it is all still on my car.
friendly staff, but horrible car wash.
i'm so upset, i just left and didn't even use their vacuums.
now i have to go to a different car wash :-/ sigh.
the only option was for them to try to reschedule later the following week.
the burger was very delicious and fries were amazing.
worst food ever!!!
even a 1 star is giving this place to much credit!!!!
the pulled pork was dry and leather texture, impossible to chew.
i seriously  think a health inspector needs to stop by and check the food!!
honestly we would of had better service at mcdonald's to say the least.
2 meals for $20 is bullshit when the food isn't even edible.!!!!!!
never will i  recommend  nevada chicken cafe!!
so i've been a big fan of wahoo's from the beginning...
but they've recently have gone downhill in service.
they completely messed up my order and overcharged me.
the channel never got changed despite being there over an hour.
this place has fallen big time from when it first opened.
not a good choice.
everything was very processed and/or tasted like it had been frozen.
we even got dishes that were recommended.
skip this place at all costs!
the girl with the short blonde hair that works there is extremely rude!
her boss needs to give her an attitude check!
don't waist your money.
we talked to the sales lady, she walked us through.
place looked great.
went back to sit down and talk about the memberships.
i told her i would take a day to think about it.
she said verbatim as she through my paperwork in the trash..
"doesn't make a difference to me, ill make my quota regardless." sweet..
i hope she did.
right off the bat: i do not recommend.
very bad service just because we didn't have a appointment.
too old, this place need some renovation especially rooms!
ordered $50 worth of pizza and the wait was 1 hour and 30 minutes.
the delivery guy drops our pizzas!!
he didn't apologize when i answered the door.
because of their unintelligent staff at this location, i am no longer a customer.
also, we realized that they charged us twice for the crispy rice tuna.
a better tire goes for $52.57 brand new.
the customer service here is the worst i i have ever experienced.
they cannot hold anything for a couple of hours for me.
the staff needs serious training and customer service.
you can disregard my last review.
this place got cocky and went to hell pretty quickly.
1) service sucked.
after waiting 10-15 minutes just to order, the waitress had no apologies.
cold, tastless, and off.
3) the lounge was very random.
not coming back, ever.
worst customer service !!!
i would rather eat at mcdonald's then eat there again!
i've been there twice and both times it was the worst ever !!!!
never going back!
i'll take my money else where !!
and their billing dept.
definitely not worth the trip or the money.
this was my first visit and the macaroons are horrible.
they are way to big for the standard macaroon.
not only were they over cooked they were all different shapes and sizes.
they were hard to bite into and did not have the light fluffy core.
definitely not a high quality product.
i wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.
this place sucked!
the food was literally inedible!
everything we tried tasted like the salt shaker was poured into it.
we were starving and didn't even eat it.
the worst service from these attendants ever.
i guess if you don't have an education you need to work somewhere.
worst part is that the manager condones the behavior.
this place sucks!!
it's only good if you're drunk and jack in the box is too crowded.
the staff is rude and don't even speak english.
so many better pizza places in tempe and way better restaurants on mill.
don't go to nybb!
the staff is is incompetent & lazy.
told the counter person i had never been there before.
they literally walked away without saying anything.
they didn't offer any suggestions/help/explanations.
my order was wrong when i got it.
because it had the wrong condiments it tasted disgusting.
nybb is extremely overpriced.
do not go to nybb!
.created erronoisly wbile trying to revise the 5-star review no longer even deserved.
really, music is fine but the profanity is not.
ordered delivery from here a few times.
everytime i was disappointed by the quality.
barely warm, lacking toppings, and cheese.
not at all what i've known toppers to be.
the best location from my experience is the fitchburg location near the super target.
unfortunately i moved near this location.
guess i'll have to find a new favorite pizza spot.
donuts are hard and old.
a two year old can do better on the frosting.
can they be anymore cheap on it?
should of read the reviews before we went.
drive thru guy was rude and short as well.
i emailed to inquire and after 4 days without reply i email back.
don't even deserve 1 star.
most rudest un knowledgeable staff i have ever felt with.
i had 4 pounds of sterling silver.
you guy's advertise you pay the most and can prove it?
i can prove you wrong.
which was only 45 dollars.
you are taking more than half of the profit.
which now because of your dickish staff, you lost out big time.
worst wal mart i have ever entered in my whole life.
i was in the checkout for a half hour too.
i wish i could give this company a negative fucking review piss poor service....
you can get the same quality, same brands for much less.
just as payless , ez, and fox.
don't rent using carrentals.com or priceline.com!!!!
haggle, haggle, haggle!!
cannot really cancel a reservation since it was completed by a third party broker.
arranged for a "maxima" like car and was told " ...there are no premiums.
persistence was successful- surprise- a premium car came available.
if you are looking for anything even medium quality please don't waste your money.
we paid 58 dollar for sunday brunch for two.
variety was limited.
everything fried was over done and so oily !
then there was mexican station which didn't have any sauces even after asking.
i expected better from mgm buffet.
have reviewed before but only for pizza.
we gave 4stars for flavor.
had our first sandwich today and was basically shocked.
ordered italian sandwich and when i got home was shocked.
sausage on dry bread.
the company's representative juan, performed an in house measurement for our master bathroom.
after receiving other estimates we decided to use sundance to complete the work.
that is where the mess began.
i left a message with the receptionist for a manager briefly describing my dissatisfaction.
i am very very upset with this veterinary hospital!!
the procedures went fine and we thought everything was a-okay.
i have had the cat at home with me since that day.
i don't understand this.
please, never order for to go.
they gave a nasty salad i couldn't see how was it.
guacamole was old, disgusting lettuce .
it ruined my lunch
seaweed salad was rotten.
we took it back and they said that's how it was supposed to taste.
the sushi was not good ...basically big rice balls.
really let down by the high yelp ratings that brought us here.
miso soup was good.
please find someone else to service your car.
ordered some items via amazon prime, last thursday evening.
i live in central phoenix...nothing tricky about finding my house.
should have been a no-brainer to get the package to me on time.
today, the package arrived...5 days later.
how is amazon still using this carrier with their obviously horrific track record?
i will never go back to this office.
i was asked about my history and if i had any concerns.
i order garlic chicken that had no salt, no favoring, it was totally flat.
i ordered fried rice that had a very bad smell and was not edible.
i will never order from here again
didn't smell bad.
after steaming, the crab meat smelled strongly of ammonia.
never had an experience with bad crab like this.
definitely not eating it.
over $100 purchased.
went to my dr. now and saw dr. pragit.
if i could give this place a no star i would.
the food has gotten really,really bad.
we thought this place would have wonderful food!
worst burger ever...
waitress was barely there...like in lala land there!
wont go back!
they supposedly open at 12.
got there at 11:56 and sat down to eat outside.
i had purchased a groupon and went online to schedule.
she returned 10 minutes later.
still not acknowledging me if i was her next client.
needless to say i didn't stick around after that.
i will contact groupon for a refund.
worst customer service costco i ever been to.
this one is clearly a store management issue that trickles down to the hourly.
teresa, sonetra, and darryl from the return counter.
not the customer service i've been used to from other costcos.
worst medical experience ever.
upsell started immediately.
they were busy and i also noticed staff standing around not working on orders.
never coming here again.
i purchased a groupon for 3 rooms for $34.
my initial phone call was great, the guy was nice and accommidating.
i said i would pay it no problem, but his guy was super rude.
this used to be my favorite place for bun bo hue.
but it's no longer the same!!
possibly a bad batch of bbh when i was there??
idk but i was disappointed.
this is the worst starbucks i've ever been to.
obviously they didn't get my order correctly.
but i would stay away from this store at the las vegas outlet.
crew was so rude and service sucks!!
giiiiiirl y'all close at 9:30 pm stop rushing people out of your store!
how does a manager have no idea.
perhaps a mon to fri 8 am to 4 pm.....just saying!
customers that are putting food in your table should be treated with respect!!!
they were very fast and friendly.
but i can't get past how awful their food was.
their food was over cooked and had no flavor.
their egg rolls were disgusting.
definitely will not be ordering from them again.
horrible experience and omg the hair cut is just so so so horrible.
i wouldn't even give them one star.
rushed job would not recommend this place for a decent haircut.
please note that i got food poisoning from my order through uber eats.
dry, tough, leathery filet-o-fish.
how is that even possible?
they get our order wrong more often than not.
but there was just no excuse for tonight's overcooked, clearly sitting-around-under-a-heat-lamp food.
called today to ask a question.
got not one, but two rude employees on the phone.
he made me feel like a complete idiot.
thanks for the help.
had food delivered.
tender meal, 2 piece dark meal, mac and cheese, corn, hush puppies.
the tenders have an undercooked texture and the seasoning was soggy.
the fries that came with are soggy.
the mac and cheese is gritty.
the hush puppies too salty.
only good thing is the bacon corn but even the bacon appears undercooked.
will not be eating from this business again.
why they waited until the afternoon before my appointment is puzzling.
tried the online ordering service and would not recommend.
the manager on duty just avoided eye contact.
probably one of the worst places i've eaten in vegas.
my burger was soggy and the meat was over cooked.
half way through the burger the bottom bun was completely in pieces.
only good thing was the tea.
never going back again i'm grossed out
seriously, does the "chef" actually taste anything that comes out of this kitchen?
the mac and cheese was totally tasteless!
no flavor of butter, cheese, or even basic seasoning like pepper.
very sorry that we chose to spend our money at this vendor.
needless to say, we will not be venturing into this restaurant.
an opportunity squandered by peachtree southern kitchen.
wish they had a zero star rating or negative that would be more appropriate.
my sno-cone was pretty good.
but we waited 40 minutes for 2 baby sno-cone and one smoothie.
we were waiting on a drink that was just sitting in the blender.
she gave us the drink and didn't even apologize.
in the end, the smoothie wasn't even good.
bland and sludge-like mush all rolled up in a toasted tortilla.
there is no valet and only a few available parking spots.
when i walked inside my room i didn't expect it to be so small.
the bathroom is also tiny with no tub only a shower.
i have stayed at numerous hotels on the strip and have had more peace!
defiantly not worth the price i payed.
i should have stayed at a nicer hotel on the strip.
my advise is if you want a 4-5 star experience avoid this hotel!
the quality of their ayce and service have gone drastically down.
while this place never had superb service, even basic courtesy is now non-existent.
after getting her attention again, she said not to eat the pieces.
we can only pick one.
such a disappointment!
we are local north olmsted resident .
now this restaurant is no use for our nice family dinner.
don"t give them your credit card number!!
i tried to use their online ordering and it didn't work.
so i gave up and went somewhere else for lunch.
shockingly, i found 3 mysterious charges on my credit card from them.
horrific experience that is still on going!
if you bother going here pay cash!
we were warmly greeted upon entry and it was all down hill from there!
45 minutes to get waters and two coffees while others waited for their coffees.
the manager seemed to just watch the place burn in between fixing order mistakes.
we will not be back.
recommend going to another jewish deli this one was the mcdonalds of deli's.
post office slow...yes, that bad.
the workers are rude also.
this breugger's needs to go....or the management.
yet another fast food place that cannot understand "no ....." mayo in this case.
dave is rolling over in his grave!
the sirloin steak sandwich now come with fresh fruit vs the grilled tomatoes.
looks like an afterthought and doesn't seem to go with the dish.
seared ahi tuna salad overcooked with tons of onions.
waitress uninterested and brought us the desert menu with our check.
i guess just in case  ;(.
not enjoyable and will not return
we won't be staying.
they couldn't be more true.
save your money buy a house, anything.
just don't rent here.
i just wasted my whole hour for the appointment.
got that sandwich back home and it was disgusting.
horrible experience terrible service
service is terrible!
never came back to give us more coffee or ask how the food was!
food was gross!!!
buffet had very minimal choices and the food was cold!
there was a bug in one of our waters too.
the hotel is nice but do not bother eating here!
a walk to anywhere else will definitely be worth it, trust me!
the manger came over and overrode it but for a $30 cushion, come on!
not worth the hassle.
you get better service at walmart - no exaggeration!
this place is garbage.
this customer service is awful.
all the employees were extremely rude.
i am never coming back here again.
if i could give them 0 stars, i would.
horrible office staff!
so today was the second visit for his next 6 month cleaning.
your doctors are only as good as his/her staff, which is poor and reprehensible!
don't waste your time here!
but once i get here, there's no one to be found!!
disappointed in my 5th's night stay in a month's time.
the rooms are very costly for family's of hospital patients.
sad how far down this pace has gone.
no one asked if we were doing ok in over an hour.
the food itself, though pricy, was pretty good.
don't think i'll ever come back for lunch on a weekday...
we have been there many times i from 8pm to 11 pm.
this is the worst i have ever seen for a restaurant ( sonic ).
took for ever to get 2  bergers.
the owner should take a good look at who is working for him.
if this is the best he can do he better look at himself sad.
waaaaay too much attitude from the female bartenders here.
you are a bartender at a bar in south charlotte.
get over yourself.
well, me, my dad, auto zone and chiltons.
it's very disappointing.
the bowls and plates are not generous.
here, not so much.
everything is very carefully measured out.
tt seems much more expensive.
really, really bad.
the kind of place you expect to find a dead hooker under the bed.
a (live) one was indeed checking in at about 6am as i was leaving.
this place really seems to cater to a low-end clientele.
working girls, gangstas, and douchebags abound.
your home away from the jersey shore!
his first job was sloppy and just messy.
the second try wasn't that much better.
as if i would go back!
they just want your money and do not care about their customers.
do not go here!
owner is rude and service is terrible.
over an hour wait for food on a tuesday evening.
only positive part was the candy on the table.
1st and last time.
had better burgers at mcdonald's
i spent $240 and it wasn't worth it.
i have so much regret.
now my teeth look the same as they did before.
this place is a total scam.
for the money i spent here i could have gone to an actual dentist.
nastiest food ever ..
all food looked really bad, orange chicken was over cooked.
will never step foot in there again.
the restroom looked nicer than their food.
if i could i would rate this restaurant 0 stars.
don't use this company.
my son hired this company to get his car shipped from texas to california.
it has been 5 weeks and still no car!
their customer service has been nightmarish and incompetent.
be ware of this company.
avoid the bay if you intend to use an american credit card.
which i don't have for my american credit card.
this crowne plaza is potentially the worst that i've ever stayed at.
the room that we got was ok, no problems that we noticed initially.
worst of all, the service desk never picks up the phone.
if that doesn't say that management doesn't care about this business, nothing does.
our company of 300+ will no longer be ordering from greenway deli.
my "star" rating would have been a negative if the choice were there.
i ordered dinner online last night, it was supposed to be delivered at 635.
around 7 it was still not delivered.
no apology or anything.
really just a cheap crappy burger joint with nothing special.
they have a ton of options but nothing worth getting.
onion rings were fake.
i would never take another piece of jewelry here again.
the jeweler was rude, condescending and patronizing.
he got snarky and laughed in my face.
don't wate your time on this jerk.
the way they display their ultra products are the worst!
i think i will make the trip to the one on 215 and rainbow!
what a scam.
never coming back.
not knowing/understanding that this place closes from 2.30 to 5 pm.
with the amount of food that there was left that would've been a no-brainer.
no apologies or feeling bad for rejecting unknowing customers.
especially when it comes to rejecting customers.
gonna wait next time a mcflurry craving hits...
gotta remember not to return here ever!
first time guests, and have been ignored for.
definitely not coming back
the only time i was there the guy didn't help me.
you want great food and great service?
best to stay away from here.
this was awful.
do not go to raul aka dr blonde at envogue salon!
he burnt my scalp with bleach!
why cant you serve dim sum at night????
you would make more money.
not very smart at all.
i came all the way here for dim sum and you dont serve.
this is las vegas not ohio.
seemed beyond coincidental, so we switched dentists.
the quality of service and car wash has become absolutely horrible at this location.
plus they have the highest gas prices in the area.
this place is gross.
go to chipotle instead.
food was cold and pricey.
and watch out: the red salsa is too spicy to eat
i found this festival sorely disappointing.
there was hardly any entertainment.
we were there over two hours and did not see any shows going on.
the lunches my friends had looked much better...
what kind of a kwik trip only has one toilet???
popular location- not a quick stop if you are a lady
it was awful!
i ordered it at 4:45 and it was delivered at 6:19.
i will not spend money here again!
shocked by the rave reviews here!
service was incredibly slow at 1:30 on a wednesday for three people...
all three of us agreed we'd never go back.
awful service and overpriced foods.
a latino cashier was super rude and ruined my day!
avoid this place.
overly politically correct.
almost a quarter of the paper is full of adult services.
can't you find a better revenue stream?
the representatives have been harassing.
the cancelation was due to a family tragedy and no empathy has been offered.
the worst customer service ever.
shelly was extremely rude, disrespectful, unprofessional, and aggressive.
so disappointed and will never do business with them again.
only reason i gave this restaurant even one star is because i had to.
i must say its the worst pizza place in las vegas.
rude and horrible customer service.
i find it very disgusting on they way they run a business.
im waiting in line for about 5min.
im thinking, ok ive been waiting 10min here and im skipped.
what the hell do you think im doing there standing for???
great way to piss a customer off.
i'll remember this when giving my money away to a casino.
i went with a group of 11 ladies for a bachelorette party.
it was only 10 o'clock, so i'd hate to see them by 2!
overall bad experience.
we're actually planning a make-up bachelorette party for my friend at og.
great customer service at lunch.
order the lunch special and 6 other customers get served before me.
wait 45 minutes then get up to leave.
am asked "do i want that to go?" can anyone say @dirtydrummer?
this chain closes at 1:30 am on saturday nights.
sincerely, a very unhappy camper.
not worth what i paid for.
this process takes 3 months!
this one is easy - just stay away from this company.
absolutely no hot water....
the hot water conveniently stopped working some time after business hours on 12/8/2017.
it is currently 6:30am on 12/9/2017, and still, there is no hot water!!!
when did this store become "meth safeway".
advise management but was told outside the doors not their problem....
they must have a great legal team!
shop at your own risk!
the zombies will follow you in the store!
this store really has slid...
other safeway sores much better!!
this place is an overpriced panda express.
i got simple noodles and they managed to mess it up.
food is inconsistent.
strong chance you will be overcharged.
don't use a credit card there.
they will charge you if you want to substitute....unheard of from any other restaurant!
all of the nail reps were rude.
made me feel very uncomfortable with their nasty looks and stares.
would never go back !
i really wanted to like this restaurant, but left extremely underwhelmed.
menu was all misspelled....
just overall very tacky, horrible service....
i have many, many diesel vans in my fleet.
i read the reviews and believed this shop may be the shop for me.
three days ago i drove over and met the mark the shop manager.
mark was unsure if they could take on that many trucks?
he assured me the owner john would be calling me that afternoon.
well three days later i am still waiting.
this was the worst experience i have had at cheesecake factory.
i have been several times and loved it.
i'm shocked at the service and quality.
shame as its my favorite place to go in charlotte when i come home.
japanese noodles were so hard i could barely chew.
the mac n cheese hardly had any flavor or cheese.
the chicken noodle has a weird chalky flavor.
we had our receipt and still never got our money back nor a pizza.
we paid $20, tipped well, and never got a pizza or our money back.
then they kicked us out of the restaurant and were rude.
the employees also gave us fake names.
i'm not one to write bad reviews but this was a terrible experience
i got a better name for this place taste a-away.
it's tasteless yogurt.
i will never let  my children go to such an out of control place!!!!
the supervisor does not know conflict resolution.
they called the police without reason!
when i called to discuss the matter, the supervisor hung up on me!
do not take your children to this insane asylum!
so sad, been going to this place regularly for the last 1.5 years.
they had the most amazing spaghetti sauce.
they've lost this loyal customer.
terri should be charged with fraud.
we're also one of those who got ripped off although our's was only $550.
so far i am not pleased with this company.
they do not respond to emails or phone call/voicemails.
they are very unapologetic as to when they make your life inconvienent.
i mean c'mon really?!?!?!
even with customers grumbling and complaining help is non existent.
no apologies, nothing!
hmmm since when has this been an accepted norm?
it is a huge hassle though when we do go.
all their paper work was signed off on saying they gave it to him.
they offered us i am sorry and a 10% discount.
i guess that is what they felt out fur kids life was worth.
we will never go back there again.
no 2 sides to this story.
sloooow service--cold food--very unhelpful manager and waitress.
the manager had said he would try to speed things up but obviously failed.
the cold temperature of the food made it very unappealing.
we couldn't wait to get out.
place is fun and eclectic but the food was terrible.
the lobster tail was smothered in paprika!
the stuffed shrimp was smothered as well and was mushy!
lobster bisque was cold!
we got pickled!!!
and paid a fortune for louzy food!!
go to vegas machine gun experience...very professional and got to fire some cool guns!
sums it up.
i would never stay here again!
go to arizona charlie's or las vegas rv resort!
this was my second time here and it will be my last!
what a dumb ass!!!
no costumer service!!!
will not go ever again
i've lived in vegas for 15 years and have never been treated so poorly.
bc of garland, i will never visit this or any wildfire again.
don't waste your time or money there.
two guys worked hard, other one spent the most time on the phone.
the price almost doubled at the end.
called and left msg.
never got a phone call back.
went to open a checking and savings account today.
they only have 1 person available to do that and only take appointments.
1 person on a saturday when people are off?
you've lost my business chase....
i don't so much for convenience from a convenience store lol....
nice atmosphere but food is a bit overpriced.
ie. wings special on wednesday is $1 each.
the service is friendly and ok.
the food is at best mediocre.
salsa is good though.
they messed up my billing when i moved across town and relocated my service.
i know without a doubt i have been overcharged.
just left and my 11 year old son is in tears.
got a totally different hair cut than he wanted.
she cut it way too short.
she was rude and his neck is all red and scratched up.
never once apologized or try to make things right.
this is the 2nd time we've had a bad experience here.
we won't be back.
this place had such great reviews.
but we were extremely disappointed in the flavors and the food was not hot!
serve your dishes hot!
hope the management reads this.
flavors were lacking/ what a waste of a meal.
if yelp had a negative 5 star rating, that is what i would use.
this is without question the worst limo company i have ever been associated with.
unable to give less than 1 start.
worst service i've ever experienced.
waited about 30 minutes to get a table.
after being seated no one came over to us.
10 minutes went by,  then 20, then after 30 we got up and left.
what a joke!
where is the communication???
no manners and not organized.
get it together!!!
stabbed me and made me bleed.
don't go here
it breaks my heart that this apartment complex still exists.
well, that it still exists and seems to have clearly gotten worse.
essentially it's the homeless shelter...with a price tag.
you deserve to live someplace with a management team and owner (s) that care.
please believe in yourself enough to find that place.
it's not coconut grove.
be well all...
they over charge.
just picked up food from there.
but joe probably came from managing a taco bell.
will never go again and would not recommend to anyone.
empty restaurant except for 4 tables filled.
more employees hanging around than customers.
after 10 minutes we left.
told the hostess we were leaving and they didn't even care.
unacceptable treatment for a $200+++ meal.
this is the worst salon anywhere on earth!
overpriced and i found hair in my food.
so many better places to go in the area.
if i could leave 0 stars i would..
don't waste your time or money with this place.
80% of the time their spray tan is out of solution or down.
in addition, there isn't a locker room or group classes at this location..
you're better off at lvac
had a groupon.
service was slow.
waited here for more than thirty minutes for bill.
did not deduct groupon amount.
server appears to have also messed up another table's bill.
we've made our last visit.
i placed an order on line including a baked potato with all the trimmings.
when i got home i found a baked potato with...
obviously i didn't go back, but i called and spoke to the manager.
i was told that there is no such list.
goes without saying that i had dinner elsewhere.
no offer of coffee refills.
had to ask for bill.
rotten service...food just ok...never going back.
definitely a typical taxi service.
next time i will definitely be calling a real limo service.
customer service is not one of their priorities.
i was so excited to try emerson fry bread at our pre-booked staff event.
she had no customer service whatsoever.
how is this place no robbed everyday????
it's like nobody works here.
i had to go find someone to help me.
this place is a joke!!
completely screw up your appointments.
well then why did i make this appointment over a month ago?!
the people at the front desk are just completely rude!
i travel for business about twice a month...
this was a new disgusting low.
bedbugs in room 1.
one of the worst meals i have ever had!
my husband, son and i didn't eat more than one bite of our meals!
the service was awful!
huge waste of money!
i ordered a wonton noodle with added soysauce chicken.
the cost was $11.50.
i will never eat there again!
i've eatten better.
for that price, i could get 2 orders and with "real" chinese wonton noodles!
i am not sure who is writing fake reviews but this place is terrible.
my last order was not even delivered yet they charged my card any way.
this place is awful.
my roommate had a horrible experience as well
called to get a price on a piece of rv glass.
horrible return policy.
bought a sleeping bag as gift for daughter with cash.
on wanting to return it, they would only give store credit.
great looking store at entrance to park but that shadiness stopped me cold.
all my spending on four active kids goes anywhere but this shifty retailer.
do not use this company to ship your vehicles.
they damaged my vehicle upon delivery due to the driver being lazy.
the strap scratched my entire wheel well and ruined my rim.
it is now going on two months with the damages still not fixed.
so if you enjoy terrible customer service..
it was all very bland and the tortillas looked and tasted like plastic.
i have given za's a chance twice now.
for a restaurant that specializes in hot dogs, this place just doesn't deliver.
i ordered a custom dog: a simple hotdog with chili, onions, and mustard.
the chili was sparce and pretty much just tasted like water.
mustard on top was applied with a very heavy hand.
onion rings were greasy and no surprise here...not much flavor.
save your money--you can get a better hotdog at a ballgame.
great location and atmosphere.
turned my hair from dark  into a golden diahrrea color!!
please save your time and money and go elsewhere.
waste of money, waste of hair gone to waste, waste of time.
avoid this place at all cost!
this place is gross.
there is nothing fresh about this mexican grill.
long time patient.
yep...eyeball was scratched so on antibiotics now.
lack of care for patients if you ask me.
at least i didn't have a long wait like i usually do.
was at dr. in less than an hour and back home.
i got food poisoning  here.
am i the only one?
onions on my burger were thin and slimy.
never ever again!
fuck this place with a space dick!
absolute horrible experience at this store.
ordered two pizzas, drinks and breadsticks at 4:20 on halloween.
manager offered to try in make this right, but i'm sorry not possible.
will be emailing corporate on this one!
unfortunately they have gone downhill and i no longer go here after three years.
they treat you like they're doing  you a favor!
they do a terrible job and treat you like crap.
totally unaccommodating for a large party of 8.
we eat out every sunday and spend an average of $50-75 each time.
bad business move on their part.
for the price it is not with it.
i got the gaucho sandwich.
it was mostly arugula.
the tri tip was cold and flavorless.
the egg did absolutely nothing for the sandwich.
the biscuit was dry and cold.
do yourself favor and never eat at eggslut.
how can you discontinue your $6 burgers???
one local spot that is losing their charm.
today was the wort yet, ordered at 6:05pm estimated delivery 6:30pm.
terrible service, no apology, consistently late and beyond their 30 min delivery promise.
called the front desk at the airport.
i said that was okay and proceeded to hold.
was on hold for over 15 minutes then hung up on.
i called back 4 times and no one answered the line.
ive been coming here 2years at least so i am a regular.
there is always someone doing walkins.
sorry thats rude and unappreciative.
no apologies or any form of communication.
pathetic customer service.
never ever going back.
horrible customer service!!!
the bourbon chicken was very tough and had a bad flavor.
we ordered lo mein, but it definitely didn't look or taste like lo mein.
took one bite and threw it away.
egg drop soup was average, wonton soup tasted old.
cheap food, but you get what you pay for.
these tacos were horrible.
i tried them after being recommended them by a friend.
i am a taco enthusiast.
these tacos made me gag and borderline throw them up.
would never return.
they told me an hour and 15 minutes.
it's been 2 and a half....and counting.
waste of time and $95.
food was mediocre, prices high.
told waiter i had a nut allergy and he brought a peanut dish.
luckily a friend noticed before i ate any.
additionally, the waiter lied about it when confronted and said he told us.
hilariously bad service
had the most extrutating visit here on thanksgiving sunday.
barely anyone in the restaurant but the service was so slow.
food was fine but can't get over how slow the service was.
got there for 6 pm service and didn't leave until 8:50 pm.
leave with more damage than you came with.
medical doctors, nurses & receptionists are rude, arrogant, and disrespectful toward their patients.
never had a positive experience at this medical clinic/urgent care unit.
this so called, "medical clinic" doesn't even deserve my 1star rating.
the perogies have always been good but their customer service is horrible.
this year was enough.
i willl never order from them again.
hello it's full i just don't want to eat your hair
the lady took forever to stop texting and realize i was there.
sept 4 2017 10:50am
totally not worth $75 and the hour i wasted here.
team is unprofessional, dr. is mediocre, and overall rude.
i want my refund.
food was above average.
service was horrible.
even the companies own website says they are open, which isn't true.
makes you wonder why they would close, health district shut them down?
treat their employees poorly so they don't have staff to keep it open?
doesn't matter now, lost this customer.
all i wanted were some deep-fried foods.
spring rolls, crab rangoon, maybe some rice to go with.
but reading these reviews, it looks like i'm not alone.
nobody said one word to me!
the guy on the website chat couldn't help me.
i told him that i'm standing at the geek squad using their computer.
i hope this place shuts down
this particular location was at the mgm las vegas hotel/casino food court location.
service was practical but i was disappointed in price but more so quality.
the orange chicken was anything but chicken.
service extremely slow.
forgot silverware for table to begin with, when they came, one place set dirty.
an order of pancakes, had a leaf of  cooked lettuce between them.
place overall dirty.
i was so disappointed and pissed after eating here.
they were requiring a 15% tip.
we were a table for 2.
i literally despise this place.
but it always gets progressively worse.
the last time i went to ciao my purse was stolen.
but he didn't.
do not go here.
the music was so loud it made my teeth vibrate.
never ever going back.
i'll be deaf for a week!
couldn't hear myself think, never mind have a conversation with anyone.
its not a night club!
the staff need to be wearing hearing protection.
been with sprint for 7 years.
it used to be a good provider but recently turned into bowl shit.
i have insurance on my phone, but they won't cover almost anything.
they forced me to pay them $200 for a broken screen.
what the fuck?
just make sure you know you have a 6 months contract.
if they say the contract will not hold you, don't trust.
very stressful and sad!
definitely wasn't a fan of this casino.
not very many people were playing at the tables or even the slots.
we walked in, walked around, and immediately left.
nothing stood out to us to make us want to stay.
clean restaurant and food was good.
i was enjoying my dinner.
the server bring my order(ikura,salmon roe) spoiled my evening.
"do you eat this?
i can not believe it!"yes,she was serving my food with this comment.
i will not go back there when she is serving.
it makes a lot of sense why cousins subs keep going out of business!!
rudest person (manager) i have ever met in my entire life!
fuck this store.
fuck this store do not shop here!!!
go to maximum comics instead
i agree with the above.
i had a bad experience with their customer support.
their product failed and they gave me the run around.
i've been to many tire shops in my life time.
this place is a ripe off.
i know it was a used tire but still.
for the price ($45 tire and balance) i feel i got ripped off.
i should have just gone to tire rack.com!!!
new tire 15 dollars more.
you live you learn.
i had to pay $1500 out of pocket for trusting them.
my wife and i should have gotten pre-approval from my insurance company.
how good are their scans if all other departments are managed this poorly?
i think amanda r.
is getting tired of apologizing...just words
ten minute wait just to get greeted, all for a smoothie and a salad?
nope, not even worth it!
two thumbs way down, guys.
good thing my #rootshummus never leaves me hangin'!
i was really excited because this looks like a really cute place.
but the service was awful.
and the bartender also ignored me, even though i was 3 feet from them.
then we sat at our table for 15 mns before anyone came over.
food was good, horrible service.
that means this place is very dirty!
mainly ages birth-5yrs old.
kangamoo needs to clean much better.
when you have a facility catering to children, proper cleaning is a must.
i will never return to this place, and i highly recommend you don't either.
it's not worth the sickness!
when you think of mac and cheese you would think it to be cheesy.
i was eating plain pasta that had seafood on top with sprinkled cheese, baked.
this location is good but this product was highly highly disappointing.
now i'm wondering if they just forgot to make my pasta "mac and cheese"???
bad service, extremely rude staff, and over priced.
will not go here for auto service again.
can't even put it to words how rude they were.
it was really bad.
walked in and smelt like sewer.
seriously i can't believe the place remains open.
i am going to contact the health department.
the restaurant is in very bad condition.
the whole place looks run down.
food was filabertos level.
do not go here.
one things for sure is people dont know real good food.
those reviews and reviewers are crazy.
fast forward it is 8:45a and still waiting to see an doctor.
had so much time i decided to write a review for this place.
i wonder what the 3rd, 4th, 5th, etc.
have to wait if i was 2nd wait?
wish my family doctor wasn't closed on weekends.
this location is consistent when it comes to rude employees.
my daughter has a membership and is forced to travel to other location .
guess they don't like cleaning the machine .
came here for lunch.
there was very little sashimi.
the whole lunch package was small for the price.
would not go back.
went to this great clips yesterday 6/11/17 and got my normal haircut.
she put powder on her cloth and went over it hiding the redness.
if you go here do not get your hair by kavitha!
do you want to wait for your coat for an hour?
you came to the right place.
edit: hour and half.
screw this place.
never coming back.
be very careful..
i read these reviews and not sure how our experience could be so bad.
first issue was lying, second , horrible communication.
folks, talk with the entire team before signing.
really, really poor communication.
fyi, we cancelled our contract and going with another builder.
i went to another tire shop that is open on sunday.
the worst experience at a hotel in years.
do not choose this hotel!
purchased on hotwire.
you get what you pay for.
you have to take 2 shuttles to the location.
the check in process is super slow.
it took a minimum of 40 minutes.
make sure you check your car and take pictures before leaving.
the car i received had a lot of dings on it and stains inside.
don't want to get charged for preexisting damage.
one customer's passenger seat was soaked.
would not recommend.
i couldn't say enough prayers...holy mother of god!
the other reviews are spot-on.
this place is beyond ghetto and disgusting.
there's about a million employees, most of which are standing around, doing absolutely nothing.
i just can't believe the trash that's around here (the people).
i couldn't get out of there fast enough.
i'll pay the slight extra and shop at safeway or target.
tried to redeem a coupon from the entertainment book at this location.
i made sure the coupon said kfc express.
after showing this to the order person she got the manager.
i responded by taking my money elsewhere in the food court.
they were totally unhelpful and apparently they have enough business.
i say go elsewhere for a positive snack purchasing experience.
team manager rented 3 vans for out of town soccer tournament.
arrived to pick up vans to learn that they had no vans.
to their credit they found us vans at another rental company.
extremely aggressive sales people.
the price should be up front.
i hope her salary is not based on commissions!
worst customer service and most unprofessional "urgent" care i have ever experienced.
please don't waste your time or entire day, like they did with me.
find quality care elsewhere.
trust me, i only leave bad reviews when it's due.
i'm just upset over it and needed to express my experience.
big disappointment, enough to keep us away for awhile.
they really defined true "filipino time".
no engrish spoken here.
upscale from "foot massage" for $20 to body for $30.
same thing as "foot massage".
curtains separate the "rooms".
oh how i wish there were options here past 10pm.
we watched tables just get up and leave, waited, waited.
watched tables ask for their check and wait, we waited, waited, waited.
we are still waiting, but about to leave (it's been over an hour now).
it was like that but with trampolines.
we decided not to use them after clearing the roof ourselves .
never shop here!
i ordered a 3 piece sectional, waited 3 weeks for it to be delivered.
they delivered 1 of the 3 pieces in the wrong color.
i'm truly disgusted
beautiful space; terrible to work with, all based around poor communication.
ended up over-charged and felt like it was a big headache.
ended up not charging us for chairs after arguing with them.
don't order anything from the emenu that doesn't have a price isted.
i ordered the featured bloody mary with the regular well liquor.
andvt's horrible to boot.
our experience at mood was a nightmare!
steer clear of this joint.
you can't wipe your menus?
i will take my money elsewhere.
went here with my girl last night .
never again !
adios  dos gringos !
only rate one star ....because i have to .
i've been to a few dealers and this one didn't go so well.
i was selling a low mileage vw bug on craigslist.
this dealer called me 5-7 times and said they wanted buy my car.
people tried to help but weren't very competent.
i ordered from ramados through just eat.
the woman who answered the phone was incredibly dismissive.
i was actually taken aback at how rude she was.
i'm just shocked at how outrageously bad their customer service is.
never fly with this airline!
exact same story on the way home.
this airline still sucks though
i've been by that place a million times and never stopped.
so about a month ago my fiance and i went there.
all i can say is that place is nasty.
never never again.
i just don't see how a place like that stays open.
came in with a coupon for an oil change.
i was told they were out of conventional oil.
i suspect they say that to anyone with a coupon.
i felt cheated.
i went next door to jiffy lube and had a great experience.
there was that customer ,me and another one in line .
i didn't wait more than five minutes .
they looked at me didn't bother to acknowledge .
i put my item back and left .
never returning to old navy again ...
food was old and cold, like it was leftovers from previous days.
i am baffled by the high ratings.
very very disappointed!
no offers of guacamole or sour cream too!
the price is way too much!
and chipotle has much better food for less money!
i have to change my review.
he gave me a prescription for tamiflu (for 5 days) and ibuprofen.
what a disappointing experience.
i'm a vegetarian and ordered a vegetarian meal, and there was chicken in it.
the first time i asked the server assured me it was paneer.
then the manager was rude.
first and last time i've ever walked out of a restaurant.
they are the worst loan service i've ever had.
their customer service is horrible and they have no clue what is going on.
i was shown with my car lifted how the rear wheel wiggled.
with so many shop charges added to it.
avoid them at all cost.
unfortunately, we were highly disappointed!
we also tried the eggless rolls which were ok however very greasy.
the airport sales tactics are terrible.
agent told me that credit card insurance coverages did not apply in nevada.
i asked her to clarify this 3 times and 3 times she lied.
it's sad to see an agent lie to meet their quota.
no more avis.
was told by so many people that this place was so good!
the chicken was teriyaki flavored yes i was confused too.
the bathroom was gross.
if your wanting hot filling food don't do it!
this place is infested with roaches...
i was eating there with my wife and a roach crawled on the table...
i looked down and there were at least two more running on the floor...
never went back!
horrible service and even worse food.
so excited to leave and never come back that i couldn't even complain.
entrees were inedible.
the staff rushed  us to place the order.
service sucks, food sucks, life sucks.
if you come here, you will feel the same.
oh yeah, my friends chair is gonna fall apart.
i will update with a photo if it does.
thank you so much for stealing items out of my car.
so glad you employe distrusting thieves!
i will never return and will make sure others will not return either!!
go down the street versus wasting time at this dunkin donuts.
never have waffle cones (6 different occasions).
can't get a banana split because they are out (btw harris teeter next door).
ice cream has ice crystals.
overcharging for cronuts ( $2.75 ea.)  and they were stale.
breakfast bagel had to be discarded.
stale and hard as a rock.
consider this your warning.
i never write yelp reviews!!
but had to for this place!!!
they do not treat their non members well at all!!!
will not be going back here again!!
friday night after football is not a good time to be here.
take way too long when all we ordered was milkshakes!!
then it was more like 2 tall glasses of milk (very little shake).
i would send it back but the servers don't appear to be happy tonight.
my carmel apple shake was missimg the carmel!
where they do that at?
wow i feel totally lied too !
it's been 1.75 hours and my car is still sitting on the lot .
i will never use discount tire again.
my life is complicated enough without bullshit salesman.
very disappointed with customer service and wait time.
staff at nextcare need to learn customer service skills.
sad thing is they were not busy.
i would give no stars
they led us to believe that we would be working the super bowl.
then they made us wait 5+ hours to ride our bus back home.
otherwise, i don't think people would have came and worked for them.
the worst customer service.
i can't believe that this store is still in operation.
i will never shop there again.
managers are of little use and no one knows what they are talking about.
such a small, crowded and loud place.
and the drinks..
i got a drink for $13.50.
oh my god.
my friend got 2 drinks for $25.
we left right away.
there are better places for sure, do not waste time and money here.
next time i will just walk past this place.
the service is just not friendly and a bit slow.
we came in for a drink and a bite to eat.
tables were just a bit sticky.
it just wasn't a good experience at all.
hey, thanks for the food poisoning from the undercooked steak i had last night.
sick as a dog.
ordered medium rare, but it was barely cooked.
lost appetite after a few bites.
you should be ashamed of this location.
we had to ask 3 times to get forks for a salad.
chefs can't even cook.
health department should shut this location down!
i agree with carissa.
i dread having to go into bath and body.
good lord its bath and body stuff why do i need help.
like woman you don't even know the person i'm shopping for.
so to save money i go to the store and torture myself.
do yourself a favor & just don't do it.
that's all i'm willing to say about this place.
save yourself the headache and the bad service.
just don't come here.
they really need to improve on service.
such rude servers.
came in last night with a group of 6 for a bday dinner.
one half had the train area and the the other had booths and tables.
but there was groups of people sitting at the other booths!!
so we decided to wait for the area that was open for tables.
we immediately left.
absolutely horrible service.
customer service is horrible.
was greeted by amanda in front.
she was rude dishonest.
i have been in the past with no problems.
our waitress pushed the desert menu item upon us.
for this reason i have no option but to give them poor ratings.
update: they opened a location at victoria park and mcnicol.
staff is a billion times nicer and the cakes are just as good.
i will not be returning to this location ever again.
rude, unprofessional people working here.
the water supply needs to be checked.
the water tasted bitter!
i found that really rude.
this is the last thing u expect when ure paying so much.
the customer service has really gone down hill at this whole foods.
twice now they have had expired tortillas on the shelf.
waited 10 minutes for someone to help me in the frozen dept.
another example of owner stupidity, shut down, liened back taxes, you name it!.
since, i've been going around the city looking for the best poke in town.
sadly, it did not meet my expectations.
it was tasteless!
the price of $18(tax included) did not reflect the quality & taste.
if you're a fan of poke, i would not recommend.
had the mussels and lobster tails, big mistake, the lobster was chewy and flavourless.
the six mussel portion was unremarkable.
angel hair pasta was clumpy and crunchy in turn.
one of the worst meals i have ever had in a restaurant.
food was not bad but major red flag!!!!
taking a customer service approach and listening to me and understanding.
the palms should be ashamed to have such a poor staff representing their facility.
outside all scratched too.
1) explicit rap music blaring loudly.
3) hoard of young tweens making our experience awkward and unpleasant.
will not return.
ended up chucking food in garbage.
my friend and i didn't care for this place at all.
first of all, the woman taking orders was impatient and pushy.
i didn't like her attitude.
when she returned it, they gave her another one which was undercooked.
mine was just ok, nothing to write home about.
this is like a glorified taco bell with higher prices.
that's all i got.
don't come here!!
food sucks !!
go to demetres down the street!
not sure why they haven't listened to the reviews on yelp!
they were basically 15$ plain pancakes !!!
it's nice to know that he doesn't care about her education!!
way to look out for your patient's well being.
don't waste your time at this location (torbram/queen.) customer service stinks!
if they mess up your order, they will blame you and not correct it.
there used to be a very kind and sincere gentleman running this business.
nowadays, you get a rude woman with poor english who has zero business sense.
it's unfortunate for this moga's pizza location.
it used to be well run.
i had a $210 deduct from my deposit.
$50 for a bbq fee.
we did not cook one time while at the location.
there was also a $160 make ready fee.
no idea what that could be.
i will be in contact with vrbo and the az ags' office.
came in for the burgers.
burger was just alright could get a better burger at bk.
you cant do substitutions,  they just charge you extra.
bacon was over cooked as well as the burger itself.
manager didnt bother to come by just walked around looking at us.
wont be back thats for sure.
not going back, the sever was very nice.
we barely ate and i have been feeling nauseous all afternoon.
don't waste a perfectly good afternoon or evening eating here.
today's experience was horrible.
it tookforever and it was not clean when i picked the car up.
they have definitely lost my business when they can't effectively vacuum a car out!
go somewhere else if you can.
the phone receptionist is rude!!!!
this is the first point of contact and she is not friendly.
i love wendy martinez but the rest of this place is junk
i was with my two young granddaughters, ages 7 and.
9 this past friday evening for dinner at mapleside.
the service staff was horrible!
our meal from beginning to end took about two hours!!!
i even had to ask three times for my check!
i will not be returning anytime soon!
paying the check was a tough thing to even accomplish!
i had to find the server to even pay my check!
i saw some chili cheese fries on yelp that i wanted to try.
i stayed anyway to try the food and i wish i didn't.
the food was bland and overpriced.
really mad i wasted $44 coming here.
i am not posting my specific reasons for my dislike for aerial clt.
that's good business practice there.
i emailed them through their website.
they explained about being busy so they must not need our business.
thunderbird just wasn't interested or simply too busy.
i'm not even going to book a ride.
and the voucher pushes gratuity in addition to the fees.
so, we are going to get credit for the voucher and not even go.
normally the service here is slow and there is an issue with being understaffed.
today took that to a new level.
never have i seen anyone clean a table in this place.
it's disgusting based due to the type of food served.
they seriously need to have more people working to clean as people leave.
the staff is equally apathetic.
i'll be hesitant to return with many other options available nearby.
le thon etait en canne...
il manquait des ingrdients et ils ont fait des erreurs dans la commande.
terrible et extrment dcevant pour le prix!
guys your online menu and your pricing in person are extremely different.
i don't know where the 4 1/2 stars came from.
if pictures say 1000 words, you tell me.
i was served warm oysters ...
but not this location our bill with tip ...
almost $100 - what gip!
more like downstream.
in town from ca and wanted to try something new.
food was bland & ill prepared.
what a disappointment.
half of the soft drinks are out.
tables are filthy.
bathroom is limited function.
staff is courteous as they apologize!
i ordered a half sandwich abd a bowl of soup.
the sandwich was a beef sandwich.
she says thanks and stuff she would look in to it.
the staff is so young that you aren't sure who is in charge.
i will not go back,  please bring back, paradise bakery.
i felt as though they rushed through the procedure.
after one week i had chipping on 6 of my nails!!
don't go here if you are looking for thai food.
i was misled by the name of the restaurant.
might be good for chinese but i won't be back to find out.
this place is horrible.
pepsi products as well.
time wasting telemarketing time share.
the rep leslie is very kind and patient.
but her manager is a shark that goes after you right  away.
very rude abd crude.
yes thats certainly the way to go for your potential customer yes
the food is good.
but wow the service here is terrible.
the servers there's were hiding behind menus and texting, ignoring the customers sitting down.
never going back there again.
when calling, rude college kid didn't know how to answer basic questions.
basic customer service training needed.
good luck getting a follow up from this place.
now i permanently moved doctors and couldn't be happier.
the new dr. is actually completing tests to find out the problem.
i too want to give zero star.
never show up.
no one pick up phone.
i purchased through amazon local.
how to get my money back?
i do not recommend this place at all.
went to this restaurant for a breakfast.
truly this restaurant is in the business of ripping people.
will never ever go back to this restaurant ever again.
so awful- most uncomfortable experience ever.
did "extra rooms" but made it seem like a huge friendly favor.
do not hire!!
very unprofessional staff.
i even called other offices and couldn't receive a call back.
it's obvious that this company doesn't believe in treating clients and customers that way.
i recommend remx specialty staffing...way more professional!!!
checked this place out to see what its all about.
overpriced menu, bland,  tasteless.
i wont eat here again.
healthy food does not have to be tasteless!
but good lord, after 6 days my nails look like that?
they should really be ashamed.
but i didn't want to judge based solely on that.
but now i can say first hand never going here, ever!!!
came here for the first time ...
i wasn't paying for a meal twice and getting attitude from this guy.
terrible customer service!!
while i was in line, i asked the employee to unlock the bathroom.
(they keep their bathroom locked.) first he told me its for customers only.
duhhh, i was waiting in line to buy donuts.
rude and inconsiderate staff.
i hate verizonlong story short.
one rep tells me one thing, another rep tells me another.
i ask for a supervisor.
supervisor fred gets on phone.
today, i decided to order online and just pick it up ...
what a mistake.
their horrible recovery is making me write this place off.
i've had enough.
the airline employees get first dibs...
so if you are traveling with your family do not park here.
we have been waiting 40 minutes after a full day of travel.
my wife called early.
they arrived with shuttle and made it clear that airline employees had priority.
we weren't allowed on.
they said someone didn't   call in.
we will never ever park here again.
you shouldn't either.
the last few times we ate here the service and food wasn't the best.
our orders seem to always get messed up.
we decided to give it another chance tonight and i wish we didn't.
our waitress (terrie) was horrible.
we ordered soup and it took forever to come out.
we asked for a manager and he never stopped by our table.
this was the last time we'll ever eat here.
paid $23 for an 18inch pizza that the bottom is completely black.
horrible customer service.
very bad service.
their payment method is very strict.
they charge about double what you would pay in chinatown.
they aren't interested in repeat customers as they are rude.
$1.00 extra to have bell peppers and onions on my $8.00 bowl.
will not be back!
go to chipotle you will taste the difference
i've been eating at capriotti's for over 25 years and love this place.
however the store on decatur and blue diamond needs help.
customers asking for refunds leaving upset.
i will still eat at capriotti's but at another store.
this one doesn't have a clue what they're doing.
-.- not impressed.
the lady even repeated my order back to me, twice..
after having to tell her my order three times.
they always get my order right.
2 stars for being a convenient location.
went to the deer valley center store....the worst!
i ordered the teriyaki beef and it was like chewing gum.
all gristle and leather!
walked in, and woman at counter seemed surprised that the front doors were open.
it was 4:07 when we decided to roll through the drive-thru.
waited for a solid minute...
so, we walk in and notice there are no donuts in the trays.
not good at all, you will be better off going to mcdonald's.
horrible fries, the hamburgers are mediocre .
am i coming back to this place?
so i said "okay then" and he hung up.
i personally don't give a shit..
i'm only giving one star because i have to.
they don't have ice cream seriously?
what kind of mcdonalds doesn't have that.
we won't be back..
i don't even remember what i had as the entree, it was that forgettable.
i guess you're supposed to add your own flavor by grabbing handfuls of those.
i suggest you use both fists.
i will never go back.
so you leave this jerk and rude asses to take care of the shop?!?!
i wish i could give no stars, lazy no customer service snarky rude assholes!
isn't that your job???
i pay my bill and i am a customer!!!!
time for a new gym!!!
they did have a lovely waiting room/ lobby very clean and nice.
which is good because in my case i waited for hours.
would be zero review.
verify the dental work is actually done!
this office billed my insurance and did not do the work!!!!
needless to say, that billing was reversed.
also be careful regarding your deductible.
overprice drinks at bar.
ten buck draft beer and 14 bucks house margarita.
will not go there again.
i came in and experienced same thing elizabeth experienced.
so of course i just doubled up on that.
the food was ok, i definitely experienced better at other locations.
the worst customer service on top of mediocre sushi and awful service.
he said "it fell from the air".
neither person at my table at black hair.
the manager was unprofessional and refused to take responsibility for his servers.
i will never go back.
waited 40 minutes for a turkey club.
expensive for the mediocre quality.
everyone was polite, but there was no logic or system to their operation.
orders would sit on the counter for several minutes while servers took more orders.
if you have less than an hour for lunch, you're going to be late.
everyone around me waited about 20-30 minutes as well
service is horrible!!
will never come back
i tried hot taco the first week it opened, it was terrible.
i tried it again tonight, it was even worse.
service was terrible.
also another time i went they didnt give me any sauce at all .
specially a girl name flor she has horrible customer service skills .
seriously this place needs an upgrade
the decor was nice and that's about it.
i honestly couldn't find one thing i truly liked.
the best thing was the cotton candy and chocolate covered strawberries.
service was decent.
i'm actually surprise that so many people like it.
do yourself a favor and go across the street to the wynn's buffet.
this was awful and i was drunk, which is really saying something.
only half the stuff was labeled.
the fried chicken needed to be dipped in water to make it edible.
desserts were terrible too.
stay away, spend your $24 elsewhere.
this place is terrible- go to the salon down the street.
i got a simple gel manicure, only one solid color.
my nails look very sloppy.
there italian herb & cheese bread is always so under cooked.
it's not suppose to look like white bread with orange lines
go somewhere else.
the food is very over priced and tastes terrible.
the presentation/plating is well done but otherwise is a complete miss.
at this location the past three weeks, the coffee has been too weak.
the staff seems nice but when you leave and the coffee isn't right...ya know?
with smiles or not, get the coffee right!
get your shit together cleveland va from a marine semper fi.
i am an uber driver and i paid $23.99 for "vip" service.....
plus $5 tip.
disappointed for what i paid for.
the interior was still dirty.
seats and floor mats were not "cleaned".
not recommending this place.
how do you run an business without sticking to your posted business hours?
that's a promise you make to your customers.
will update this review once i've had a chance to try out the food.
worst customer service ever from all, including the store manager!
this one on 32nd st & greenway is bad.
hot and small, but yelawolf is here so everything is going to be okay.
sound here fucking sucks
by that time we were sitting, not eating anything and getting full.
their table had 3 adults and 1 kid.
a few co-workers and i showed up at around 11:10 for lunch.
we waited till 11:20 and they were still closed.
hey this place look nice.
but the place is a shithole.
service department sucks.
and they have my bike for 5 days.
still can fix the f.....
if my bike is not under warranty.
i wouldn't come here....this is after i spend $2300.
just go online or go to best buy.
and again he kept blaming me.....
this place is disgusting!
no damn display for the colors.
i would never recommend this dirty hole to anyone.
customer service is horrible and they probably don't clean either.
smh i don't know how people come here.
was a little bummed that the little kid section was closed during construction.
glad they are doing construction, seemed a little worn and dirty.
couch smelled like urine, it was terrible.
may check it out after construction.
thought this place was good due to the good reviews.
came here and got a full set of bio gel nails in matte black.
the job was okay.
the lady doing my nails kept on getting distracted.
they charged me for things that i don't know what they are for.
when i called in the lady told me it was $55.
by the end of it i ended up paying $85.
i don't know what went wrong with others on here.
maybe they have some unrealistic expectations.
the technicals were very professional and knowledgeable.
explained everything they even fixed how the microwave had been installed by the contractor.
since the great review things have changed.
still hasn't be resolved.
i also picked up my car yesterday and they forgot to connect the speakers.
hesitant to even bring my car back to reconnect the speakers.
the facility is completely empty, but the wait is long.
so i'm prescribed tamiflu, but do i even have the flu?
waste of time and money.
there seems to be no rhyme or reason to there  constant rate increases.
place continues to be a headache and a waste of my time and effort.
happily taking my business else where!
this place is a huge waste of the space they managed to acquire.
and the brew selection is absolutely abysmal and has no taps.
there is no real tea in there.
it's all powder stuff.
i was there today and i knew exactly what i wanted to buy.
to boot...they were out of stock of what i wanted.
i think the apple store system is broken.
i am going to limit any purchasing of an apple product to the web...
avoid this car rental company in las vegas.
poor and long service when returning the car at las vegas airport.
almost doubled my initial quote when i returned the car.
i had always avoided hertz in other cities.
i thought i would give them a try again.
i only gave one star because i'm not offered a lower score.
this is the worst doctors office i have visited.
allissya on the front desk has no people skills.
i will never return to this office again.
please look for a different office to take care of you.
waste of time.
fucked up my whole afternoon plans.
bowling was fun but service for dinner after was horrible.
our server should be promoted to manager and the manager fired!!
felt so bad for her.
i booked appointment through yelp  and decided to buy a series of blow outs.
made appointment at salon for 2 weeks later.
i show up and front can't figure out what happened to my appointment.
had charity event that same evening.
asked for refund for the credit i have.
front workers said they couldn't and i have to email owner.
bad business on tatum and shea.
can't even get a decent soup and sandwich.
sandwich wasn't bad, there just wasn't anything good about.
the sprite was ok.
never going back.
sadly the only restaurant in my office building.
her response " i know what i said you are wrong"  .
just wow customer service at its finest .
i will not buy another $40 cookie cake from them .
i will never shop at a jared again!
3 out of my 4 rings lost diamonds out of them.
there is no reason this should have happened.
i have spent thousands of dollars in this store and so has my stepdad.
never again will i deal with this company!
chame to be treated this way.
i recommend you just drive by this shop.
if the appearance doesn't impress you, leave immediately.
the quality of work is equal to the appearance.
the puzzles themselves were very simple mechanically, and the staff there was very impatient.
they were not enthusiastic about making this a positive experience for us at all.
i would not recommend this room to any of my friends.
don't let the somewhat swanky lobby fool you.
unfortunately no true mexican food in boulder city, nevada.
don't ever go here!!!!
i laughed and said so if i'm sick i can't come here.
don't waste you're time!!
can you give less than one star?
every time i walk in this store i want to scrub the floors.
this place is an eyesore in our community.
cvs should be ashamed to put their name on this store.
overpriced and overrated.
even the fries just tasted like potato wrapped oil bombs.
you have been warned.
the food wasn't fresh.
i ordered idly-wada and pakora for take away.
sambar was wattery.
idlis tasted stale.
worst bedside manner ever!
way too busy!
hamburger was medium rare.
sick for new years.
one place to avoid.
stick with in-out.
at least they are consistent
i do not like you either.
you call that salsa?
that is hot sauce in a cup.
i like spicy food, but give a guy some options here.
no bar area either...thats kind of lame.
so yeah, we won't ever be friends.
i'll be down the street at pancho's instead.
usually coming here is fine, similar to any other dispensary nothing special.
tiny portions and mediocre food.
they are way too expensive for what you get.
they charge about as much as bad daddy's but it's mcdonald's quality.
also not happy with the fact that they don't have kids meals.
the line was out the door and it was packed.
but that's only because it's new and just opened.
i don't see it staying that way, not with what they charge anyway.
low quality buffet food.
came in to buy a handgun and rifle with/for my wife.
this was tuesday may 1st 2018 at 5:30 pm.
um its not and shes 25!
this place should get rated like a negative 5 stars!
avoid at all costs!
(spoiled) tapas were sporadically being distributed between the tables with no rhyme or reason.
almost like they were guessing.
our server was trying to make the best of it.
service isn't good but it isn't terrible it just doesn't really exist.
i'm guessing this is supposed to be a place for non asians?
good size you won't leave hungry which is good but 2.
the mac salad was a salt mine or just plain inedible 3.
tried this location 3 times.
the last time we ordered it at 4:35, definitely not peak time.
after 45 minutes i tried calling the store and no one picked up.
listed to a recording for 3-4 minutes and gave up.
the pizza did arrive, right at 1 hour late.
i turned him away.
tried calling the store again and still no one would answer the phone.
maybe better employees as well as better ingredients papa.
the women working here are terrible and mean.
they did change the seats, but the gas-leak-stench is still there.
i do not recommend this cinema for anyone, disability or not.
the dumb bitches who worked in the front desk were soooo rude!
they threatened to call the police on me for being in the pool.
don't go here lol.
would give zero stars if i could.
i should have received my packages by 8:00pm thursday.
here it is sunday afternoon and i still don't have my packages!
i needed them for this weekend, so it's too late now.
of the primanti's i've been to, this is the worst.
the food is bad, the service is worse.
during a recent visit the waiter messed up something for everyone in our party.
last night the bartender was flat out rude.
if this primanti's stays open i'd be shocked.
i hate to belabor this but how is this company still in business?
is there no regulation of large companies?
beware of these folks people.
they've gotten too big and don't care about the consumer.
was there for dinner this week.
had plans with another couple to go back on weekend.
cancelled those plans.
service was poor, portions small, prices high.
chicken was luke warm and dry.
manager has no clue on talking to customers for feedback.
every bad review is worth 10 good ones and this is that one.
oh yes, checked the bill and charged for more drinks than we ordered.
i was forced to call three times with mostly vague apologetic responses.
suffice to say, i will never step foot in pavilion again.
not good if you're looking for what they advertise.
but for standard airport food close to terminal d, you'll be ok.
it was incredibly boring, dirty, and primitive.
i will not be back until some type of renovation has been done.
bad experience after not having been to a red robin for a couple years.
ordered two burgers, both were okay and somewhat bland.
my fiance's burger was severely undercooked.
server was unapologetic and lethargic at best.
took 15min after clearing table to get our bill.
will not be back to red robin for another 2 years.
receptionist was not nice.
after reading other people being treated the same way...
i have to say i feel a little better.
had an attitude the moment we walked in the first time.
returned for another visit some years later and the same exact treatment.
i went to the urgent care on cactus and 79th much better treatment.
in and out with a brace and xray in 20 min.
son is now being seen by orthopedic surgeon.
never go there!!
they severely scratched my car window trying to take off a sticker.
he is refusing to fix my car and raised his voice while ridiculing me.
will not return.
i've been to this particular panera twice now, several months apart.
got a little food poisoning from their rice.
oh well, i lost weight.
this place is filthy.
they remodeled it not long ago and don't know how to keep it clean.
every time i come here we are sat at a dirty table.
never fails leftover food on the table and booth.
dust all over the wood by the booth.
i can't imagine what the kitchen looks like.
says a lot about the management not caring.
i am not returning to this location.
the hosts are terrible at signing people in.
rude and arrogant.
one waitress on the floor with several tables.
she forgot to bring the drink then asked her again but she didn't serve.
so horrible service.
he was extremely rude and acted like he knew the policy.
alright ..so this restaurant is a no-no..does not check any of the boxes.
requested for fried rice but got white rice .
the explanation this time - old chestnut used .
not an excuse .
sorry - but please eat at this restaurant at your own risk !
this office staff is awful.
so rude and don't know what they are doing.
since i was drinking water i just left.
sevice is terrible the waitress checked on me after the 40 minute mark.
service that slow shouldn't be in an airport.
he also said that cancellation of sale will result in additional charges.
the sale transaction was ok, the post-sale process sucks big time.
would not recommend
that was quoted at automotive services as almost a $400 job.
i went to this bosa at 37 w.
i took my business to the bosa at 1835 e.
southern ave in tempe and presented them with the same request.
the nice lady not only honored my request, she wished me a happy birthday.
thank you southern/mcclintock bosa for helping to make my birthday special!i
and then 220$ for a bird blood panel i'm just floored.
had a reservation that they would not honor.
told us that they could not accommodate us and we're just rude.
would not ever think of going back there.
way too many other places that i can spend my money.
i've been coming to this salon for over a year.
i called to ask about a battery replacement.
they said sure come in $11.
when i arrived they said $25.
i had driven accross town, burning gas.
but i guess they didn't mind giving me the bait & switch....
bad business practice ..avoid them!!
i ordered over $44 in food from the drive thru.
i brought the food home and found they messed up my order.
they didn't include all the ingredients of my meal.
the lady hung up and will not answer the phone anymore.
phone is off the hook.
got my hair dyed here recently and it ended up looking horrible.
i made an appointment before i went in and said i needed a colour.
after applying the colour on, she had put me aside to take someone else.
we will never use them again and will stop recommending them to others.
yes, she hung up the phone on a customer.
motel 6 offers more services....
use extreme caution eating here!!!
disgusting and i will not be back here until this employee is removed.
that was horrible customer service!!!!!!!!
lack of ingredients and flavour in the bowl has me super disappointed.
the quinoa could use some flavour and the topping portions were incredibly small.
pokito on queen is miles better.
won't be returning to cali anytime soon.
the chicken was overlooked.
the soup was too thick.
the cannoli and creme caramel were bland and even my soda was lacking flavor.
i'll choose another buffet next time for sure.
place is disgusting!
not sure how the health inspector hasn't shut this place down yet.
not a joke, worst restaurant i have ever been in.
lost my business for good.
ordered online through grub canada.
was supposed to take 45 minutes, finally arrived after an hour and a half.
do not order from or go here unless you enjoy being sick.
this place is full of liars.
i was going to the gym in tolleson and they closed down.
not the number is disconnected and the website no longer exists.
im so pissed right now.
they deserve no stars.
get out before they start draining you accounts.
worst steak and shake ever.
lunch the other day was good.
cocktail service: abysmal.
don't walk away after delivering menus and come back 20 minutes later.
them take 30 minutes to deliver 4 drinks.
especially when we told you we were ready to order when you delivered menus.
but - hey - you couldn't hear us.
you were too busy wrapped up in your own head.
i will never use their services again.
apparently only managers can do that, negating the need for someone answering the phone.
first last time.
flight at 5 delayed 3 times to 10:50.
rumor is not enough flight attendants.
that doesn't fly with me.
not the weather!
it's sunny and clear skies.
the fish tacos leave you feeling sick..
spicy sausage flatbread was not too impressive either.
thick bread and bland..
unreasonably overpriced too.
20 minutes in line on a sunday.
as if we needed a reminder of why nobody bowls anymore.
e-mail from them acknowledge receipt of messege.
never received a call.
very disappointed at professional customer relationship
worst fast food place in the whole country!!!!
ordered drive through and was told to pull over by the front door.
ok, no big deal.
they were swearing the whole time i was in there for 10 min.
young female manager was swearing too among themselves.
they need to be visited by an undercover boss!
i just got hung up on by a customer service agent!!
they dont verify your last name or your email.
they act like i waited 3 minutes to talk to them!!
the worst customer service in the country!!!!!!
the absolute worst.
i had my worst experience last night at this peter piper pizza!
i was in disgust last night.
the sides were also cold.
will pick famous daves any time....
sorry, guy i think you got this one wrong.

this restaurant is filthy.
the tables are always dirty, condiment area filthy and soda machine nasty.
i wonder what the kitchen looks like.
this place needs to be inspected by the health dept.
yeah, find another spine place.
long story, i'm in early retirement now.
the worst experience ever!
dr. young's nurse was awesome and helpful, beyond that, go somewhere else!
all about the benjamin's there!
i will no longer be coming back to hot taco.
first and last time here.
things to avoid1.
sambar - mostly water and eggplants2.
idli - rock hard3.
butter egg curry - enough said4.
goat curry - only sauce, no meatavoid this place
i tried to book an appointment with bombshell beauty.
i never received a response.
i waited over a month.
i'm a stickler when it comes to returning calls, messages and etc.
integrity is everything.
she insisted for us to stay--so we all got a beer.
expensive, slow lousy service.
these guys don't have a clue how to serve the customer.
they just keep raising their rates.
this place has had terrible service for years.
i sat at the drive-thru menu waiting to order for 20 minutes.
no one asked to take my order.
all of this took about 20-30 minutes, in the drive-thru!!!
i will never spend money here again, no matter how hungry i am.
9 min later she brought the gravy for our dinner.
my meal wasn't hot to begin with.
9 min after she put it on the table it was cold.
he apologized and took $1.99 off the bill.
are you kidding?
he was $1.99 sorry they thoroughly messed up our meal.
came here at noon for a strawberry acai refresher.
this is mainly about the service.
she stared at me and just kept talking to a coworker.
after a minute she finally asked what i wanted.
not to mention my pretty simple drink, is gross.
barely any flavoring and ice.
totally ruined my night.
security made me feel like a criminal.
the security rules are completely nonsensical.
if you go, just go without a purse.
get a better security company.
why should i pay to lose my dignity?
the worst service ever!
fish fry was terrible.
fries over salted and burned.
cajun pizza was soggy (crispy crust...
not!) had to ask for water 3 times.
only saving grace was the manager came to apologize and offered a gift card.
some lucky winner will get this card for the game show show!!!
this place is a joke.
30 min of waiting to find out the deal i was offered doesn't exist.
i will never rent with hertz again.
it's unfortunate that this has happened with costco's car wash.
i firmly believe costco delivers in quality and customer support.
i've recently contacted customer service and will update once i hear back.
don't waste your money here.
i had the seafood steamer and it was horrible.
i had a stomachache the next morning.
what a waste!
bar tender gave my friend tonic instead of a gin and tonic.
refused to put gin in it.
they only serve it on weekends so i thought it would be something special.
my daughter was very unhappy and frustrated with their tutoring technique.
this place did not work her.
the experience got even worse after dealing with the manager, jesse.
i am giving this dealership one star for tony in service.
if you can find your car elsewhere, make the drive to another dealership.
every dealership i went to in asheville provided stellar customer service.
this place is godawful.
i left feeling hungry and disappointed.
if you can't nail steamed rice then you can't nail peking duck.
the "persian tea" i got tasted like normal black tea.
they don't even deserve a single star!
home office didn't answer and couldn't leave a message because their mailbox was full.
called another mover!
if you want good prompt service call moveaholics.
i can not recommend this place due to slow poor service.
three strikes...you're out!!
not for us.
the service was awful.
waited over 30 minutes for our food.
was never checked back on.
order was incorrect and food was lukewarm.
they won't listen if you try to explain that yes you had an appointment.
did this to my husband too in the summer.
nurse is rude as well as are the receptionists and "office manager".
what a scam!
the staff didn't even bother looking us in the eye..
careless and irresponsible service!
they suggested we "regift" the item.
needless to say, this was frustrating.
we like to shop local, but buyer (and gift giver) beware of this place.
not only is the service slow they also messed up our order.
not sure we will be back.
i don't have a problem with big department stores.
that said, for a big name store this zellers is horrible.
the change rooms are always a disaster and have a very strange smell.
i mean that is the most disgusting thing i have ever seen!
this mall is ok, but avoid the zellers!
i wenr for dinner tonight.
i frequently go to indian restaurants so am very familar with the food.
we ordered goat curry and chicken tikka masala.
the goat curry had 60-70 % fat and bones.
will highly recommend to avoid this place.
hey the emerald suites on paradise has renovated rooms .
one star because the service was good.
the food was the most awful hunan i have eaten.
sauce on the orange tofu was a gelatinous mess.
this place is utterly disgusting.
one person working and complaining about how she hates her job.
the fries were uncooked in my poutine and the kale salad had brown kale.
didn't know kale was brown?!
anyway the service was enough to make me never go back.
only the pumps work, the inside is under construction so take that under consideration.
the meat on the burger was paper thin!
i was shocked when she brought it out!
the bacon on the burger was also very thin.
did not taste good.
i figured "well you can't ruin french fries at least" - wrong.
customers are asking "well can we just sit and wait." her response: "no.
will never measure up to the saint rose dominican hospitals!
save yourself the disappointment and aggravation.
if you can get to any of the dominican hospitals do it.
awful damn service, sat down and no one served us.
watched other people get in after us and get served.
never again, this place can suck it!!!!!
first off, the server was horrible.
she didn't listen and got several drink orders wrong.
she also took up to 20 minutes before getting drinks and refills.
the food selection was abysmal.
and the taste was worse.
things tasted stale, like they set out too long, old, and unseasoned.
i would never return to this buffet or recommend it.
we've been coming here since 2016.
i look around and everybody has their "outside" food in the designated eating area.
so far, i've had an awful experience.
i've left 2 voicemails and spoken to 2 people.
also the show is not interactive could easily be a self guided tour.
my controller at the end of the show did not work.
would not recommend.
not accessible for a wheelchair.
not even another entry or ramp accomidations.
very sad that ada laws are being broken and not even considered.
i hate cox communications.
i really felt like i was getting scammed.
staff and office were nice.
will not be going back.
worst customer service ever.
as i got there, it was closed.
what if i had paid online?
would i just lose my money?
i'm never eating this trash again.
rude, lazy staff, and it's a dangerous store.
people get stabbed here.
look it up.
just had the worst service.
the management was terrible.
i wish i could post negative stars for the hostess alone.
the waiter we had had been working there for 5 days.
there were other wait staff didn't even attempt to help him.
we waited 10 minutes before someone came over.
the manager walked by didn't even stop.
when our order was taken he couldn't get that right.
not completely his fault since he was new...
service was terrible.
needs new management.
service is super slow.
i'm glad i was paying with cash.
roaches in our room!
and our bed!
this place was pho king terrible.
after removing all the meat, my stir fry was edible, but bland.
tasted much better after drowning it in sriracha sauce.
overall, not a great experience, and i don't think i'll be coming back.
best part of the meal has to be the sprite.
this dominos is really hit and miss.
my daughter ordered boneless wings and the portions were ridiculous.
they looked like they took the normal sized portions and cut them in half.
i included a picture for laughs.
so, tonight's food was really under par.
big thumbs down!
made us think....
very disappointed in skinny wimps.
i'll never use them again, and i do not recommend them.
my belongings were stolen by the housekeeping staff.
do not stay at the quad.
really awful and frustrating experience, i will never stay with them again.
the food isn't jr.
i am amazed they let it have the name.
the place is disgustingly dirt.
tables aren't clean, bathrooms are gross, and the food isn't appetizing at all.
if you haven't been you aren't missing a thing.
except a possible e coli scare.
started to unexpectedly rain within 5 minutes of us arriving.
saw him do this to four people.
just wash it yourself before coming to this place.
chandler, location: this place is the biggest rip off.
the people are fake and could care less about customer service.
do not consign or buy from them you will regret it!
second time they have hired low performers.
jgg electric and appliances company is incompetent.
their personnel lie and they do not follow through on their commitments.
please do not use this inferior contractor.
interesting the hotel doesn't have a yelp page.
this place is a joke.
now i know next year we will stay at the residence inn
i asked him a few uqestiosna dn he asked "what my point was".
not very friendship or helpful
i went to fry's to buy a printer.
i came in with a short list of four top-rated printers.
of the four they do not sell the best-rated epson wf-3620 at all.
the other printers were not in stock either.
if they keep this up, they will go the way of radio shack...
do not order any meat!!!!
we order appetizers, good.
we ordered the steak, and asked for medium-rare on the rare side.
it was pink, which i consider medium.
$70 for an overcooked piece of tasteless beef.
will not go back if they is how they take care of their customers........
without fail, the leg on the back of the couch was broken.
what a waste.
the place was empty and it was friday night.
i ordered some ribs and they were nit good at all.
wont be going back for sure
car towed after a 45 minute wait!!!
the food is very good.
not very conducive in a fast paced place like asu/ tempe.
our order was taken within a minute.
maybe next we will call in our order and then eat there.
you been warned stay clear of anasazi animal clinic...
this place sucks ass!
twenty minutes for a stella, are you serious?!
i really don't appreciate having to sit here and wait for absolutely nothing.
there is no such thing as quality here & i'm extremely disappointed.
thanks sugar factory for ruining my 21st.
never coming back!
terrible sanitary condition.
i will never go to a dos gringos again.
i will encourage others to do the same!
i took my wedding dress here on a recommendation from poffie girls.
worst mistake ever.
they have the worst costumer service ever.
called them to get a quote.
said they would be out on wednesday or thursday of the following week.
no call no show.
just left david nail and it was so disappointing with an incredible artist.
second, probably one of the worst sound systems.
we were stuck in the drive thru for 40 mins!
we will never be back here.
called ahead for a large table...
when our large party arrived they claimed that we had not called ahead.....
this was a huge inconvenience for all of us.
will not make arrangements to come here again.
very good fruits and vegetables, but way overpriced everywhere else.
also watch out for expired packaged foods.
they will often sell things that are expired or very close to expired.
another thing to keep in mind is that the neighborhood is rapidly detoriating.
tons of hoodlums wandering about.
two people  were murdered just down the street recently.
lots of fights and such too around.
stay away if you are wise.
worst experience ever...i will not be going back to this place...
money wasted and not worth it!!!
ppl there are rude not welcoming at all!
poor food quality.
i went this morning at 8 and everything was so dry.
i just got up and walked away, that bad.
i had a complimentary buffet because of myvegas but don't spend your money here.
went in there today for the first and last time.
i decided to eat in, not take out.
they were not busy with other customers, i was the only person there.
they were cooking take out orders.
during my entire visit they did not engage me in any conversation.
the counter girl did not say anything to me outside of taking my order.
south euclid location.
i generally like heinen's, but not this one.
it's not so much the employees, or the store, but the other shoppers.
there is a definite me-first vibe that is just...unsettling.
i give one star because i can't give a zero.
the lack of access?
i have to provide an update on the quality of the products we purchased.
we paid about $1000 for our dining table and chairs.
the table wood has started to lift and warp.
the 2 end chairs that are cushioned are now very springy.
you feel the springs in the chairs.
we've only had the set since march (about 5 months).
i'd highly advise to stay away from their products.
anyone who gave this place above two stars does not have taste buds.
i know indian food i grew up in asia.
indian food is one of my favorite cuisines.
i went to the buffet.
i received bland, room temperature food  with undercooked meats.
go to the dhaba which is just up the street
this was a terrible experience yesterday 10-30-15 for this store.
the employees were dressed up but no smiles.
i hope she wasn't a manager.
we ordered a greek omelet.
two tiny hunks of barely warm feta, chunks of nearly raw onion.
asked for dry toast and it came slathered in butter.
they did bring another basket right away, tho.
if you like french fries you will like these.
the technician basically was guessing as to why my freezer doesn't work.
3 service calls later, it still doesn't work.
this company is awful.
the "manager" rachel is horrible.
she will rip clothes out of your hand.
accuse you of being a thief, then threaten you.
she should not be in any job that requires customer service.
it has been 10 days since i have written this review.
i have emailed the general manager and the corporate office.
visited late last night after a show.
the guy at the counter was not fit to work in any hospitality field.
he was rude and condescending.
i will never go back to this lousy place.
definitely no more than two ounces of meat.
i would not recommend this place.
take your money elsewhere.
this wendy's is particularly terrible, as in how is it still open for business.
nobody seems to care at all about what they are doing.
the manager took my order, over charged me and got the food order wrong.
cheshire cat tattoo eyes on the arm so she's identifiable.
i actually had to ask 3 times for cups.
not to mention the place is just dirty.
on hold forever.
no one ever picked up.
terribly slow automated phone service.
i was curious why all the bad ratings.
now i know why.
thanks for nothing.
first and last time going to this location.
or any capriottis at this point.
had a long nasty hair in my food.
not a good experience.
pretty sure they were overbooked, so they rushed us through our appointments.
went home and soaked my foot in hydrogen peroxide.
will not being going back.
would not recommend.
worst costumer service ever from all wf banks.
no pens, tellers missed spelled everything, very slow.
i have so many friends that love this chain, but i'm not a fan.
i've eaten at different locations across different states, but always end up sick.
i've gotten sick from salad, pasta, to steaks.
the majority of the staff here have no idea what they are talking about.
we went to crush in a large group.
3 of us ordered the lamb chops - 2 med rare and 1 rare.
i said well sir i ate it and it was well done.
very disappointed,  we found this place on groupon and had a party of six.
we made reservation explaining  that we had two different coupons.
honestly i've eaten at many brazilian steakhouses and this is set up so cheaply.
stay far away!!
they only give you 1 little pack of  parmesan cheese and hot peppers.
how cheap is that.
pizza is dry as a bone too.
horrible place to gamble.
up $35 after 3 hours.
got cut off from bar and asked to leave.
i live in vegas and it was worst experience i've ever had.
what i can comment on is the service......or lack of it.
another couple came in and the server went immediately to them.
this buffet was highly recommended by friends i was visiting.
i'm not sure i'll ever go there again.
for italian food, there are much better choices in las vegas.
this place trades on the past, and on an overblown reputation.
i found the prices high, the portions small and the food mediocre.
fortunately, the food and atmosphere in this place were five star fabulous.
i understand that servers, like everyone else, have bad days.
approach this place with caution, though i hope your experience is better than ours!
i went in to make a claim on my warranty.
poor geek squad customers service.
and an inability to solve the issue
drove out here because the hours listed that it was open at 3:20 pm.
extremely frustrated as i drove out of my way to try this restaurant out.
tom,  every time i go to your queen creek location i have issues.
miserable rat fucks that made me wait 4 hours to put on new tires.
little rotten witch at the counter and a manager devoid of balls.
i came here instead of discount to save a few bucks.
they had all 5 of us in a one bedroom suite.
the hotel tried to contact them with no responses.
we did not get our room until 12:30am thursday morning.
i have called them several times and then emailed them still with no response!
beware they offer so support or communication!
watch your purses ladies...
my phone was stolen here
horrible horrible horrible!
only 2 mins.
i had to sign up for yelp just to write this.
sadly spooner actually helped greatly.
shame on you, spooner.
you're supposed to help people.
this place is awful.
and the service was the best part of it.
food was awful.
couldn't finish and i was starving.
a small domestic beer was $13.
the best part of the dinner was the fat guy striptease.
worst mexican food i've had in my entire life!!!
you couldn't pay me to go back there.
the enchiladas were watery and disgusting and my taco was soggy and inedible.
i would give this place less than one star if i was allowed.
today, 09/29/2018, i visited the green restaurant along with my family.
we ordered a kids burger for my daughter.
the burger had a patty and bun but was without cheese.
one of the rudest waiters i have encountered in the beautiful city of tempe.
i will not go to this restaurant again.
what a rip off.
but being from out of town, i was at their mercy.
i ordered a bacon egg and cheese bagel.
it was for my son.
he said it tasted like ass.
to add insult to injury, it cost $10.50.
i could've gotten the same at einstein's for four dollars
do not use this company.
staff does not seemed bothered or attentive to the fact the wait times exceed.
an hour on any given shift.
go elsewhere, time and money would be better spent!
this is the worst mexican food i have ever had.
it was bland and greasy.
i've used annie's services several times and had always had a good experience.
after today however i will never go back!
needless to say i did not have my dress for my trip.
this time it was there and i was obviously not happy.
4 little pieces of broc only.
first time we came in i asked them to check my daughter for rsv.
second time i took her in i thought she had a uti.
i am so utterly appalled by this facility.
i have a challenge for the management/executive/formulator/whatever at starbucks.
what is it that they serve?
is this how low humanity has fallen?
presumably, they would go bankrupt if they had a good product, right?
wish i could give a 0 they are homophobic big time!!
thankfully living social stands behind their customers and they gave me a full refund.
my recommendation is to find another service provider.
thanks for caring for your patients!
i will never go back there worst experience i have ever had.
where's the beef.
this was my first time eating at johnny rockets.
i ordered the rocket cheeseburger.
the hamburger patty came in pieces that didn't even cover half the bun.
the burger had no sauce and was horrible.
stay away from this location if you want a decent meal.
hands down worst mcdonald's we've ever visited.
way way overpriced, staff didn't know if they were coming or going.
this place has really gone down hill.
just came back again in 2018 and it's gotten worse than before.
prime rib was so tough, crab was picked over small and never refilled.
the next night i went to the wynn and that is much better.
i recommend the wynn buffet
i hate this place more than ever.
their green goddess bowl is the biggest hot mess of crap.
won't come here again.
you won't get good value for your money at this location.
the rice is bland and often not cooked properly.
i also saw food handling practices that weren't the greatest.
the last time i went the shrimp i received tasted off.
do not order this via yelp/grubhub..
they will not make your pizza or deliver..
work your sh!t out please.
wish i could give this 0 stars.
i never write reviews but this time i needed to give my opinion.
the queue wasn't too long, the server was awesome - so friendly and helpful.
got our food and  wow total disappointment!
i managed to eat less than half of my cheeseburger, hubby ate slightly more.
glad i tried it, but seriously wish i hadn't!
should went anywhere else
if i was able to leave negative stars i would gladly do so.
i have never dealt with more incompetence that with this company.
you call corporate and they "fix it hopefully".
i mean we pay to eat good food...
never coming back again due to bad service..
would not recommend...
avoid at all costs.
the service was horribly slow.
the manager was full of excuses though.
just an update.
i brought my sweet beast back to this vet clinic first thing this morning.
they acknowledged fault and   took full responsibility.
i'm happy they did that but  i stand by my initial review.
i will never go back there.
by dog is family and i take her care very seriously.
i expect my vet to do the same.
did you notice how small their dishes are?
i think they use disposable plastic small dishes.
i would not recommend going there if you don't want diarrhea.
this club should be avoided.
go to the tempe location instead or join another gym.
if you want streaming music on thomas st. forget it.
the locker rooms are dirty too.
the showers especially.
even after speaking with management there has been no improvement.
i received a thigh which normally they'll ask or a chicken breast.
my corn was cold.
there was only one waitress serving the entire restaurant and that was frustrating.
i set an appointment to have my air conditioner recharged.
the man on the phone took my name and information and stated 89.00.
he quickly honored the quoted price of 89.00.
you want a good burger try fatheads
worst food ever in my life.
seriously the restaurant should learn and should not defame the name of indian food.
petsmart does this all the time, he didn't.
quite frankly he was a dick.
i would give this 0 stars if i could.
foolish me wanted a caesar salad and i quickly ordered one from here.
rookie mistake to order from here, will not be coming back again.
worst 6$ spent.
he feels his works is "perfect" and he could have never made an error.
the kitchen is very dirty and the food is over priced.
being a past worker i would not suggest anyone waste their money eating here.
it's recipe based cajun food that misses the mark and the authenticity.
he just basically ignored us.
i wanted to get into verbal disagreements with someone.
food is great but service is horrible.
tall white guy taking the orders was a complete jerk.
we changed our order before we paid mind you and he freaked out.
throw our box with food in it.
there was a lady there before and i wish she was still there.
i will make sure i tell people not to go when he is there
it was the worst time when i went there.
the owner was a horrible person.
he treats us so badly because i prayed.
and they brought us an old bread.
bruschetta was stone cold , and did not taste fresh at all.
i also ordered their classic hot wings which the waiter said were really spicy.
service: quick and cheerful.
overall: would not visit this kelsey's again.
the worst customer service i have ever experienced!!
both employee and manager were very rude and unprofessional.
the ladies up front were very friendly but that's about it.
went in a little before 9am for a conjunctivitis, didn't get seen until 10am.
the place wasn't even that busy.
i asked isn't conjunctivitis usually associated with colds too?
she told me yes it can be.
then just dismissively told me to take an over the counter drug.
horrible customer service!
worst place ever.
never ready on time, understaffed, bad
i hate myself for coming back to the store.
lord someone build another grocery store downtown.
click and collect orderwould not recommend!!!
when i ordered the tablecloth yesterday the website stated that 5 were in stock.
a waste of time and gas.
this is the second time ikea has disappointed me.
service was great but when i got home.....
it was a different story.
my stomach hurt for hours.
not a fan of their dishes.
i've had better hakka.
horribly expensive for what you get.
paid over $13 got two cold eggs one slice of undercooked turkey bacon.
coffee and some bread.
i will never be back.
so, i'm not sure why ordering online causes problems for this restaurant.
don't pay the extra $4 it's exactly the same size.
which is sad because pei wei and this location used to be good.
how can a "fast food" place like panda express be pei wei's prime competition?
century link is the worst !
no help and 200$ charge !!
don't sign a contract
i was expecting something delicious with the great reviews but was sadly disappointed.
my meal had absolutely no taste.
i added salt,  parm cheese,  and squeezed three limes on top of it.
it was better but after 4 bites total,  i was done.
the calories were definitely not worth it.
i was unaware that my money was any less important
the staff in this location is very rude and not helpful.
oh we don't carry that anymore !!
does it say we do?!?!
she was yelling for no reason & i was only asking a question.
that was the worst hospital ever!
16 years ago this buffet was awesome.
the desserts looked nice but were unimpressive.
the king crab legs were the only thing that was excellent.
i liked my cappuccino.
went there to get some bubble tea to go.
they were laughing and playing with the bartenders.
i will definitely not go back there.
i wont be going back.
if i hadn't checked the food i would have gone home with it.
please change your description of the services you offer.
place is empty.
totally ignored by staff.
very overpriced for what you get.
the customer service is awful.
she said yeah you're right but i still can't help you.
it was a mistake!!" really?!
you are handing them out right & left!!
i think you could have spared a few more:(
this location is a rip off.
they overcharged, do not give you as much food.
do not go here.
there are better locations.
this place just gets worse with age...
see my previous reviews for the highlights.
consistent with my first review- -missing food-confused servicewhat's new?
i was very disappointed with the custom service at this location.
i bought a headset that was defective.
the associate that was trying to help me was nice.
the supervisor was very rude.
i won't recommend this location and i will never come back.
i went here thursday evening with my friend.
i vomited about an hour or so after eating.
throughout the weekend i was unable to eat anything without vomiting.
i went to the hospital today and they confirmed it was food poisoning.
will not be going here again unfortunately as the chicken was not cooked properly.
absolute horrible company who lies about when they will ship your car.
go elsewhere this company is an absolute joke.
have talked with others who had the same experience.
that was car shipping companies are supposed to do.
seems like the bed bug issue is common here.
i was in room num.
let me first start by saying i love tropical smoothie.
but this location is either to busy or they just don't care.
their food so far had been good but not really worth the long wait.
with so many places to choose from customer service is so important.
how am i supposed to eat this ???
--- not coming back !
food is decent.
service- not so much.
much better choices out there if you want service.
i was actually here a little over a month ago for lunch.
tables were not clean, and plates not set.
i saw them at mr congee when i left the mall.
however, food was so-so.
just ordered two plates of dumplings and i wasn't too impressed with them.
i wouldn't recommend or come back here at all.
do let these reviews scare you like they scared me!
i'm an idiot for flying this airline.
i'm not sure what the reason was that i decided to ignore their recommendation...
oh yeah, price.
which ended up not working out for me anyway.
i phoned in my refill on 10/8/2015.
i returned on monday 10/12/15 only to be told again that it was filled.
i was then told by the pharmacy manager that they had lost my refill.
i am never using ge pharmacy.
they are idiots-do not use them.
this is a terrible experience.
i didn't like this place.
i got fish tacos.
the beans and rice were terrible the beans looked like dog vomit.
i went with a friend and she said it was amazing and pretty authentic.
well i didn't like this place i would rather eat at any mexican restaurant.
but if your looking for an authentic california taco place this is it!!
food is awesome.
burgers are amazing...
however, sadly, one waitress completely ruined my experience there.
nichole was our waitress...was ok til the end.
nice guy, but "niceness" does not equal good customer service.
the worst customer service and workers.
every single person that they transfer you to says something different.
not worth 1 star, not even worth 0 stars.
this company is going down hill fast.
don't waste your time, just stick with spectrum.
the pizza is as bad as little caesar's and much more expensive.
horrible, horrible service.
i went twice before writing a review.
the first time i thought maybe it was an off day.
the second time, they lost me as a customer.
the food was okay, nothing special.
hell, denny's usually has pretty solid service.
this place will have to go to an extreme to get me to return.
if i could give them zero stars, i would.
the worst customer phone service i have experienced in my lifetime to date.
i've given them at least 6 tries and every time, disgusting.
mango smoothie also had a weird taste.
if not, jatukjak is also worth the travel.
i must say, i was surprised to see so many 5 star reviews.
sales experience and trustworthiness of the sales team = 0!
this place sucked for a one week stay ....
front desk was horrible and so was the manager.
i don't own a time share but i would never buy here!!!!!!
horrible customer service from the customer service desk rep., toni and the assistant manager.
she called over the asst.
manager who was just as condescending and rude - both on a power trip.
these guys are crooks.
they doubled their quote when they came.
i needed 2 men.
they sent 4.
i can't recommend them for anything.
they are useless.
find someone else.
michaelcui wouldn't refer them to my wife's boyfriend fu
the service was fine it is the after that is terrible.
this place is a cesspool and needs to be shutdown.
avoid this place at all cost
made the appointment on the phone over a week ago.
had they told me on the phone last week wouldn't have been an issue.
why spring that on me last minute?
she then asks if i want to get the shot for her.
very disappointed in the professionalism and the waste of time.
i am paying for the cup?
since when are you denied a large cup of water?
i gave zebra another chance, and have been let down again.
maybe zebra was once a aaa 4 diamond restaurant, but not anymore.
service is sloppy and lacks knowledge, but still pretentious.
what a disappointing time for a once aaa 4 diamond restaurant.
i hope they can turn it around.
i went in to buy some foundation and few other things.
there was not one single person that was friendly or truly helpful.
in fact they had a terrible attitude and were very rude.
i asked for their ad and the girl was so rude about it.
i've been here twice and not once did i feel welcomed.
the brush sections was a disaster i couldn't find what i was looking for.
this store is disappointing.
never going back there in my life.
considering reporting him.
went yesterday, most likely will not return.
our theatre was not just dirty, but trashed.
absolutely disgusting...and in an upscale, very expensive shopping center.
we like to compare the calamari appetizer at different restaurants.
the calamari arrived  with half squid and half zucchini, and was also rubbery.
we got up and left, and went to alessia's at brown and higley!
if you are in the east valley give it a try.
first off, the shuttle.
lack of sign at the las rental car.
second - the place didnt feel right the second you walk inside the office.
the location is just weird being mixed with a different non rental car companies.
its just wasnt a good experience.
the only kudos, shuttle driver.
do not stay here!
had to stay due to moving.
other reviews are right, your safer in your car in some other parking lot.
management is horrible and rude.
people fighting outside and the "courtesy officer" is no where to be seen.
seriously this place should just be torn down.
the remodel is a joke.
strolling by it seemed good...
the egg breakfast is totally fine in that deep-fried-sysco-homefries kind of way.
i'd give this place no stars if i could.
nope he was making her order for her on the spot.
i refuse to give my hard earned money to assholes!
now i know why people don't go to outback.
clean up your act, outback.
i had not been here for a year and thought i'd try it again.
i also got a plain bialy which was stale.
the people who used to own it were so wonderful!
do not go there!
i came with a friend to check this new place.
food is average at best.
the old sushi restaurant is way better.
wont be coming back
went to see dr. richardson for a shoulder problem.
very rude dr. did not treat my condition at all!
6 months later still suffering with the pain.
boo cavs suck!
shape was uneven and no attention to details whatsoever.
have no idea what people were raving about
i came in here for a quick wash.
there really starting to fall apart.
towel service has been on and off.
i requested a consult which requires supplying personal information.
no big deal.
until you cancel your appointment and the harassment begins.
i have cancelled my appointment several times-email and telephone.
they continue to blow up my email and text.
each time i received a text or email i again cancelled my appointment.
i have not seen or spoken to a doctor.
after this ordeal i will not reschedule.
i came in for a regular manicure.
she finished the manicure in under 7 minutes.
if that's not rushing, i don't know what to call it.
she said "i don't know".
until then, ill keep driving to newmarket to my regular nail lady.
i hadn't gone to bonterra outside of restaurant week once in two years.
everything was overpriced, food was cold and inedible.
the mussels were not fresh.
this place left much to be desired.
will never come back to this hotel.
i booked a three day rental for a total of $97.37 with unlimited miles.
i was charge a total of $224.10.
when i asked about the charge they claimed i opted for supplemental insurance.
i mentioned this to the agent and they enrolled in their supplemental insurance anyways.
don't book with these scumbags.
couldn't wait to leave and won't be back
round trip from phoenix to honolulu hawaii july 3rd.
flight back to phoenix was flawless.
in my opinion, you are taking your chances when flying this airline.
i was really wanting to like this place.
i wasn't really hungry tho so i just settled for the coffee.
they asked me if i'd like cream and i said yes.
unfortunately i didn't take a sip until i was far away from this place.
maybe i'll go back to try their baked goods because they did look good....
and maybe i'll try the coffee again but for now 1 star.
you're better off eating grass at the curb.
all the food is full of msg, over cooked, soggy.
yet it's packed.
what people won't do for a $12.99 meal and bring their own wine.
horrible disgusting dirty dark place with shady business practices.
there was a rat under my bed and people loitering outside my room.
beware do not stay at this place
if they had a zero star i would select that instead.
i'm a foodie who loves to try new places.
this was one of the worst places i've eat ate.
the food was disgusting.
i would rather eat my daughters easy bake oven food over this.
i wouldn't feed it to my dog.
came here for my birthday breakfast.
host said we can pick our own seat and didn't hand us menus.
10 min later we stood up to get our own menu.
a server finally came after sitting there for a while.
worse denny's out here.
ladies, leave your backpack purses at home.
they force you to lock it up outside of the store.
the greeter and security were rude and this rule is offending.
we will never come back here.
eat a dick, walmart.
i'll never go this location ever again.
attended this program for 9 days.
do your research before you send a loved one to this place.
it is not a safe place
well that is what we were expecting and it isn't that at all.
it's super cheesy and corny.
we walked out on $100 seats.
we were extremely disappointed.
they advertise in their website that is fast food and they take so long.
they wanted us to pay $9 extra or use the coupon next time.
i said no way i am paying for you mistake.
we walked out without paying a tip.
f*ck this hospital.
american horror story-asylum should have been based off tegh.
tegh would have better luck employing children.
came here on a saturday.
service was decent but not very good at handling our complaints.
we ordered two entrees, 1 turkey dinner and 1 beef brisket dinner.
the turkey came out mildly warm with a pretty decent amount of meat.
i do not enjoy paying $13.99 for 5, 5-inch prices of brisket.
i will never return to this location again.
way over priced for sub-par food.
anticipate long wait times for maintenance to fix something.
don't be surprised if an office employee speaks to you with an attitude too.
also, the gym doesn't look like it has been cleaned in months.
there is a thick layer of grime, hair and dirt in the yoga room.
are you freaking kidding me?
the last time i order from this place.
extremely unfriendly staff.
set your standards low so you're not disappointed.
got my nose pierced here last night.
granted, they have some amazing body jewelry here.
but the piercer and front room lady were extremely rude and rushing.
but the piercer especially was pushy, rude, sarcastic and unwelcoming.
two us bank employees working but only one of them is helping customers.
the other one just played on her phone.
when asked if she could do a quick deposit she refused.
will not come back here again.
extremely poor service.
not only i can get bad customer service but also crappy food!
not only the burger was dry, the worker wouldn't give me vinegar.
the plane we flew on, though, actually had no first class service.
i have never received even a form letter in reply to my complaint.
if i could give less than one star i certainly would.
the adults excuses were that they roughhouse in their family.
threatening a kid, how brave.
i guess that is also a license to act like a total *#$ clown!
i was craving meat jun, drove to the outdated address that was listed.
the person who answered wasn't sympathetic at all.
i coulda got cheaper in hawaii.
so shame an waste my time, gas, and money!
the general manager along with her employee were extremely rude.
i will never go to this location again!
i will continue to go to 59th and thunderbird!!
i don't remember the last time i received such horrible customer service.
i was the only customer in there and she seemed distracted.
i will never return to this subway again.
we booked a car through music express who contracted omni.
we brought our son to vegas for a work convention.
i wouldn't recommend.
i wish i could give them a negative 10!
this place sucks!!
they charged me $800 for a starter that is usually only $120.
never ever go here they will rip you off
we arrive and they said we needed reservations???
communication is also a big issue here.
i would give 0 stars if it were a possibility.
after waiting 15-20 minutes and not seeing this guy.
we gave up and purchased our other items.
while going up to pay we see the guy just hanging out up front.
i will never again patronize this location.
had an extremely unpleasant time following initial entrance to the store.
i didn't know cleaning up meant thread half of my thickness off.
if your thinking about moving here don't.
very unprofessional and poorly run to be getting paid 157 a month
in a a word- sub-par.
was craving ramen so we decided to try this place last week.
maybe it isn't suited to my pallet.
the fried chicken is great (dark meat only).
i wouldn't recommend this place all that much.
all day after i ate it, i felt sick.
every time i come to this location i'm given worse and worse service.
instead, my food was brought to me four times incorrectly.
rtm is the only place in town that wants to be paid for guessing.
i wish i could give them a negative star
be careful of billing at this office.
downgraded to one star.
still love the apartment but management is no better.
they got a free pass so they will just continue doing anything they want.
bartender named taylor is a rude $%&%@!
had never been here before.
no reason for her to be so rude.
would not recommend for food, super plain and over priced for what it is.
i would rather have a mcdonalds egg mcmuffin over the one they served here....
also, our service has been god awful.
p.s i threw that sh!t away and order barro's pizza
that is nonsense talk.
it was a slap in the face.
at most five inch sub with pre packaged meats and non hygienic food service.
five bucks for small bottled water.
overall cost ~$15.
this place leech off of poor tourists.
cheaper and better to eat at starbucks.
i'm not kidding
love the look of the furniture (some).
but the leather furniture quality is horrible!
the leather is thin, brittle and cheap with very little flexibility- truly poor quality.
* note: this unit came with-only a one year warranty.??
i'm a huge fan of chinese food and i generally like most of dishes.
i really couldn't finish the hot and sour soup.
there are just too many good places to eat nearby.....
i would never go to or recommend newport motors.
very rude and disgusting!!!!
i looked at the van then went in to find what they wanted.
i told miles he was waisting my time!!!!!
i  didn't appreciate the noncence this used car establishment pull on people!!
don't use this company they are ridiculous!!!!!!
this place is a dump!
it's a truckstop what do u expect?
nasty drivers and low class people.
so i usually order a trenta black tea shaken with 6 agave no sweetener.
i stopped her and said i'll open it.
i am calling starbucks cooperation about this.
i will not order from this location ever again.
wish i would have reviewed this place before going!
terrible unfriendly service!
my year old could have done a better job washing my car..
needless to say food was overly greasy and salty.
unfortunately i have to pick a star otherwise they would get zero stars!
do not use this place!!
we booked an appointment 8 weeks ago for october 29th.
they never called or showed up.
we called to follow up and got a voicemail and nobody returned our call.
obviously not a reputable company in my opinion!!!
i was short three cents.
never coming back to this stingy location.
& he said he doesn't know & will let the manager know ...
obviously it's the same the following time i went  ...
stil no receipt when u press yes for one !!
that's crazy..doctors are cool, not that dishonest receptionist...
the wait was fine, but staff was not friendly at all.
i have a horrid bruise from this facility.
not happy with my experience at all.
also, the absolute slowest starbucks i've ever been too!
i wish i chose a different title company as a seller.
they screwed up in several ways.
they overpaid republic services (trash) so its been a nightmare of getting a refund.
both republic services and chicago title are refusing to cooperate.
i can't believe they let these monkeys run a title company.
save your time and go with another title company.
not a review just a notice on product recalls currently on list.
for your kind information.
just got turned away at 8:40 on new year's day!
drove 20 minutes to come here.
posted that closed at 9pm and there were people eating.
used to be a favorite spot for our family.
what a shame as i will chose differently in future.
avoid this place!
disappointed to say the least!
service was terrible even when the dining room was empty.
had to wait 10 minutes  for drinks.
all in all a disappointing experience for such a well-rated restaurant!
horrible service and they won't back their product.
had my iphone 7plus for 4 days and the home button cracked.
he refused to help me because the phone wasn't bought thru them.
dumb excuses to not stand by their product!
they didn't want to fix my phone and practically insulted me.
i waited 3 hours too!
the burger reminds me of cafeteria burgers from junior high school.
i got it with extra egg, which was dry and scrambled.
almost as dry as the burger meat.
very unprofessional and not considerate.
restrooms are locked and you need to ask for a key.
do not come here.
not at all as advertised.
would not recommend getting a haircut, at least during the weekdays.
idk what the weekend is oike., maybe some actual barbers work there??
poor customer service.
young employees need to be trained much better.
terrible experience for the money spent.
will be contacting corporate.
just plain awful!
the fries and onion rings are disgusting: soggy and dropping grease.
do yourself a favor and go anywhere else.
the worst experience of my entire life!!
the customer service was so horrendous i just can't believe it!
the hallway probably hadn't been vacuumed since 2015.
all these incidentals could of been looked over if the price wasn't so high.
it made us very uncomfortable staying here and we feared for our safety.
do not stay here!!!!!
called to get pricing on a storage unit and was immediately put on hold.
never called me back.
called again later and then got hung up on twice.
also usually cafe rio is known for loading your food to the brim.
not here you get a teaspoon of meat, rice and beans.
the only good thing at this place is the new location.
everything else is trash.
always wanted to try this place  on cactus and tonight we did.
nothing like i expected--guess i didn't know the type of place it was.
everything served in styrofoam and plastic utensils.
ordered a tamale and a cheese enchilada.
could not differentiate which was which or if there even were two items.
there was not a single mexican person in the place, guess they knew.
i purchased two salads to serve with stromboli..both were wilted, orange (old)..threw them away
i'll phone to talk to the manager today though.
i'm sure this place will be closed in the next 5 months anyway.
we were attracted by the yelp rave reviews.
we took one look and left.
looks like the good reviews were either paid or self-inflicted.
maybe the food was good but the ambiance was not good.
terrible service they should stick to selling boats they are clueless about customer service.
counter rep engages in small talk, to confuse you during signing off.
this is my review for food only.
food is no bueno!
i came here during the day time at lunch hour.
for food i wouldn't recommend dining here if you're sober.
the lady their was totally rude.
wasn't helpful and didn't really answer any of my question.
ended up taking my dogs boarding at petsmart for the doggie hotel.
poor customer service.
so i didn't get my question answered and they didn't get my business.
i brought a pair of shoes  to cecil's in mid october.
they were supposed to be done in two weeks.
i went back a month later and he could not find them.
i took them back and will go to another shoe repair store.
there was another customer there too who clearly was in the same situation.
i would sincerely warn you away from this shoe repair store.
its clean inside.
but there was a pretty good line going at check out.
and the cashier was more interested on texting then actually doing her job.
and the manager was standing only a register away scanning new product
this restaurant has pretty good food but the service was so.
they also charged us for the sweet potato fries that we did not order!
so we had to wait another 20 minutes for the bill to come back.
wouldn't recommend for someone who doesn't have that much time in their hands.
hong kong wonton soup tastes like instant noodle.
came out to be $14 something after tax.
does not taste good either.
over priced for an instant noodle.
amazon, please stop using these idiots for package delivery!
i needed my order today, not tomorrow!
this was the worse experience i have ever had with threading.
my eyebrows were very in even and red and look swollen.
my money will stay with carolina place.
do not eat here!
customer service sucks!
run far away from this restaurant!
if i could give this store zero stars i would.
stars don't even exist when i am talking about this market.
i have met the owner before and she is the rudest hag ever.
i don't know why i even go there.
there is a new asian market that opened up on blue diamond.
go there instead!!
i bought a bottle of wine tonight.
i just opened but didnt drink it.
qualit du service  la clientle absolument excrable.
dure de l'appel: 5 secondes.
this hotel is a disgrace to the las vegas strip.
while the price was low, a motel 6 would prob be cheaper and better.
the parking lot was extremely flooded and the elevators would work half the time.
a total dump...gross.
the worse of dd.
the ice coffee is always too creamy or watery.
they can never get it right.
you can never taste the coffee.
came throw the drive throw monday afternoon around 230ish.
i placed two orders.
the first one was wrong.
the other order was correct.
the rice tastes burnt not worth the 10 dollars i paid for.
spring rolls wear ok iv had better.
if i could give -10 stars i would.
do not eat here, clearly they don't pay attention when they're making your food.
was interested in a used vehicle here.
came here and no one wanted to be bothered.
called the salesman i was getting phone calls from and automated emails from.
phones rang and goes straight to an auto attendant.
that's okay, i'll go somewhere that actually wants my business.
when he gave them his name they said it wasn't ready.
on top of it, the food didn't even taste good.
we'll never go back.
unprofessional, deceptive, and unethical business practices.
save yourself much time and aggravation -- do business with your local dealer.
euro cycles of las vegas hasn't quite mastered e-commerce etiquette or courteous customer service.
last time i went for a gel fill and it was like $80.
they are robbing the rich who don't notice.
i work hard for my money and i just can't with this place
she lost a $700 deal over $20.
shit service try ikea instead much better everything!
stopped in thinking i could save money from the price ted weinz auto.
the service here is always horrible; the staff moves incredibly slow.
the food has flavor, and their salsa is spicy.
they make homemade tortillas but unfortunately mine was burnt and dried out.
their margaritas are delicious and the decor festive.
i don't think the prices are worth the wait or the portion sizes though.
where do i start.
i have to pay for tap water.
i have to get my own soda from the back.
i order cheese enchiladas and get a plate of red sauce and lettuce.
i waited and i sure enough  paid $15 twice for one meal.
beware pay with cash only..
they will blame the machine having issues rather than righting a wrong.
i'll never eat here again.
slow service, astronomical prices!
$30+ for a double espresso, two waters, and a small bag of popcorn?
might as well have been held up at gunpoint!
absolutely angering prices.
apparently walking in means putting your name on a whiteboard and coming back later.
sounds a lot like appointments only to me.
i been sending requests with zero response for hours.
even though it says responds within 30 mins 100% of the time.
i'll call elsewhere.
worst hooters experience ever.
lousy service, cold food, and you remain thirsty the entire time.
new owners again.
they just took over.
they assured me that everything was the same, its not.
the crust is so thin that the bottom was burned and crispy.
they obviously have changed the recipe.
after a couple of slices we just threw it away.
the pizza is no better than domino's.
i cannot recommend east side pizza
toe nails were trimmed and when i got home notice they're not even.
cuticles look terrible.
gel pain job looks sloppy.
will never go there again.
nail girl that i got was rude and mean.
terrible service, disgusting food.
over priced .
if black hair in salsa .
looked pubescent ....
good air conditioning, good food catering but that is it.
this place ran out of water!
i have never been to a banquet and have to served bottled water.
they are under staffed with just one "water cart" to serve the tables.
the next issue is how the staff runs this place.
why can't they take that cart to the kitchen!
this is your bargain basement banquet hall!!
i should of came back down and asked them for shortage.
they had name on comp and could of called my room.
well lets see.
service usually is good.
however went there with a party of 4.
i read another review of a similar situation....seems like a real problem there
this place is a wasteland.
zombie mall shambling forward for absolutely no reason whatsoever.
the only redeeming feature of the surrounding area is an in and out burger.
it looks to be about 75% vacant.
this entire area needs to be reworked.
avoid this mall.
it will give you the sads.
what can i say ?
waited 45 mins for nothing.
on the website it did not show any restrictions.
the server only told me that they didn't do it and didn't explain why.
so went ahead and tried the regular menu.
breakfast sandwich we ordered was bland and had no flavor.
the only thing that was somewhat decent was the monkey bread.
i wasted my time here and should had just went to kitchen table.
came here to try the peking duck and other dishes with my family.
left with one of the worst experiences at a restaurant.
we finally got fed up, paid for our peking duck and left.
go somewhere else if you want office help that doesn't give you attitude.
not on time, not even in the window they gave me.
the driver was great, to bad he doesn't answer the phone.
we just wanted a car and go.
not clean at all had to roll down the windows just to stand it.
never go back to the place and will let everyone else know as well!!!!!!
once i received car, he ignored all calls, text, etc.
i would never purchase from again if i had the chance to do over!
i ordered product from backcountry.com that was guaranteed to arrive the next business day.
i placed the order on a sunday.
it is now thursday evening.
i work in a very accessible building and often receive packages.
i admit i now distrust backcounty.com and ontrack.
if amazon is  using ontrack, i will shop elsewhere.
wow what an awful experience start to finish.
the technician also left no invoice during his phantom return visit to my home.
reporting this to my bank and the bbb.
this company should be shut down !
we never got to eat because we sat down and no one acknowledged us.
so after 15 minutes we got up to leave.
stopped at the cashier where the manager was and still wasn't acknowledged.
walked out, never walking back in
our company is close to them and we had went a couple times before.
the outside deck is nice in good weather.
the inside is kind of crappy, run down, dirty, and just smells.
the bathrooms are the worst.
we will never go there again, just from this expirience!
hostess was awful, but the waitress was nice!
it's dead here and the food was awful.
will not be back.
such a shame because the location is great!
i added guacamole to my burger.
will never try this place ever again.
i continue to call the spa, but the voucher is now expired.
i really dislike this entire chain.
i have eaten a few and have not been impressed.
this is tex-mex cafeteria food.
wish i could give it less than one star....
bartenders are so rude.
there's a bunch of lounges around i suggest you try another...
your below average las vegas buffet.
stale food and poor selection, but a lot it.
it is what it is.
if you literally have exhausted all other food options come here.
never go there.
terrible place to go if you like your money.
all the time trying to sell their magic omega 3 pills and glasses.
i called the office and guess what?they can't do anything about it.
terrible costumer service, never go there.
crab legs were still frozen, cake was rock hard, and everything was lukewarm.
only plus side was service was attentive and plates were cleared promptly!
first time great and reasonably priced for fries, boneless buffalo wings and dips.
this fourth time is the last time.
don't go here.
5 stars for convenient location & polite regular staff.
look at all of the photos i took.
it's a lawsuit waiting to happen with the lack of appearance and potential accidents.
they obviously are in need of a huge renovation.
bottom line, until i see major renovations, i will never come back.
make sure you come packing too...lots of unsavory characters.
never go here!
never got a text.
ended up leaving without eating.
horrible service and complete disregard for customers.
great location unfortunate restaurant.
pretty pissed off with place.
so how does that make sense?
they are literally scamming people and selling them shitty laptops for hundreds of dollars.
don't go here
never coming back here again.
this place is super sketchy- located around business area (mostly autoshops).
it seemed like it was a wanna be nightclub or something.
not only that, its expensive.
definitely not worth the price.
do not go here.
they are not professional, they are over priced and their work is awful!
i'm very disappointed and on my way somewhere else to get it fixed.
i used to enjoy this location until today i was rubbed the wrong way.
i've never had a problem returning anything from anywhere ever before, at any business.
over all it doesn't make sense.
sadly, the food at yummy yummy was the toal opposite of its name.
what i received was bland, and somewhat generic tasting....
super slow staff and they gave everyone else bread except my table.
pizzas took 45 mins...
food is authentic, but not fresh or of good quality.
we had to leave the food on the table and go elsewhere.
even if this place were bug-free, i would not eat here again.
poor quality food and not a clean establishment.
the worst customer service ever.
they are the true terrorist of the air.
nobody answers the phones.
this airline is a joke!!!!
they suck ass.
do not waste your money on this tour.
this tour is not even worth $5.
all you do is walk around and stare at buildings from the outside.
i was so disappointed.
if you want to know about ghosts, read about it on the internet.
do not waste your money on this overpriced tour.
just wanted to keep everyone updated.
it's been over a month now.
again the workmanship and quality of this job was absolutely horrible.
he put curbing in at our home and it was all crooked and wavy.
i immediately called and asked if they could come fix it.
i could not believe how arrogant this guy was.
i would never hire this company based on that alone.
i visited las vegas with five friends during march madness.
mistake -- big mistake.
their servers and managers were a combination of slow, inattentive, ignorant and disinterested.
in keeping with the basketball theme and quoting sir charles: "turble."
waiting since the last 3 hours on a stat order.
extremely rude front desk people don't make the experience any less excruciating.
yelp says it's open 7/24!basically they lie !
if i could give no stars i would.
i came in for an issue and was met with judgment and criticism.
i do not recommend anyone going to this place.
want to spend forever with the keystone cops of customer service?
get this service.
pathetic, pathetic, pathetic...did i mention this is the most pathetic service you can imagine?
you enter your info.
so, my co-workers and i decided to give this place a try.
the restaurant wasn't busy and service was slow.
at that point we all decided to leave.
we were all disappointed.
fyi - the 45mbps at&t internet speed flies compared to the cox "claimed" 50mbps.
as more people login on cox, the speed slows to a crawl.
hardly the proper attitude for a company so many people love to hate.
wish we had made the change years ago.
complete and utter ripoff.
manager basically ignored us when we asked him to explain this.
paint all over her skin on every nail.
treated her hands like a lawnmower blade and not like a human.
coarse and sloppy.
she will not be going back.
will find someone else.
and the bathroom was even worse.
the kind of jerky that the cowboys took with them crossing the west.
i was very surprised to see so many positive reviews.
all the ambiance of a dmv with none of the character.
do not get your dog groomed at petco.
when i picked my pup up, i discovered they had shaved her!
i'll never go back and you shouldn't go either!
just walked out.
when i sat down i told the lady 3 times which one i wanted.
she didn't get it even then and got up and walked around.
went to what seemed the owner or boss and spoke for a while.
so i left.
everyone saw and nobody said a word to include the boss.
this place is inexpensive for a reason.
tried this place last night and the portion size was very disappointing!
sorry, i will not be eating here again.
the service was the worst.
had to ask for things at least three times.
but the worst was the fact that the sushi looked old and unappetizing.
plus the hot things were cold and cold things were hot.
i can echo what ned p.
said of this place.
i had nearly the same experience.
burger was dry and over priced.
clear that employees or management really don't care about their food quality.
but the new menu is a refreshment to the old menu..!
what a joke this place has become!
the service is like getting served by a bunch of fraternity brothers and sisters!
worse nail service ever.
they dont seem to like groupon customers.
the same lady that was running the front desk provided my nail service.
it was rough and choppy.
it appeared that it was the manager, she was not fullu attentive.
never going back!
just got done eating from here.
very disappointed i would say check your food before you drive off.
make sure it's actually hot.
i hope they don't do to you what they did to me.
this place was horrible.
almost everything we tried tasted like crap.
everything was just bad, bad, bad.
paris so far as the best buffet there by far.
never doing buffets in vegas again.
la has the best buffet.
hokkaido in sherman oaks for like half the price!
stayed at primm resort on the state line and paid for the hour service.
i received a connection but it was so slow.
this is not mexican food the tacos are disgusting.
there is literally one ounce of meat in every taco.
i have been frequenting this location for years.
recent visits, however, have been beyond disappointing.
i think the restaurant is likely struggling in this location, leading to cut backs.
it was a huge nightmare dealing with their staff.
i would urge to go elsewhere that are more professional and experienced.
there are more competitors that can provide a world of difference.
this place doesn't even deserve one star the food was not very appetizing.
definitely not up to my standards.
the service was also bad no refills and dirty plates on the table.
waitress walk right past our table with empty cups and dirty plates.
everybody else got better service than us maybe because we are not white.
overall worst breakfast of 2017 and wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.
i scheduled a ride to the airport the night prior to my trip.
madison taxi emailed a confirmation.
after 15 minutes of waiting and no cab i had to get an uber.
the confirmation email combined with no one showing up is inexcusable.
cheap and for a reason.
left a second message the next day.
of course no call back again.
the waiter was awesome though!!
this place is over hyped.
branded as a "24 hour" donut place but this place is garbage after 1am.
my friends and i each get our donuts.
cookies and cream?
don't waste your time here and go to bosa donuts instead.
the absolute worst casino in all of las vegas....
it needs to become a landfill.....
service = haaaaaa, none to be found anywhere....
tightest slots around.....1000.00 gets you 1.20please do not go there....
tourist trap for surevery very disgusted
our drink and food order took long as well.
finally, when we received our food..it was cold.
the ribs, ravioli, tacos, etc were all delicious.
won't be going to this buffet anymore.
will just go to tacos el gordo instead.
used to be decent, pretty much sucks now.
literally probably the most expensive bar in bloomfield.
for some reason their drafts are way over priced and taste awful.
the place is kinda a dump too and looks terrible from the outside.
men's bathroom reeks and is just filthy.
i probably won't go here again.
food never ready, don't accept their own coupons
what a shit show.
whatever you do do not stop here!
classic small town rip off.
debt card fees,  don't accept cash,  overpriced gas.
borders on fraud.
we will not be coming here again.
first time at this location and just needed brows done.
wow, what the heck do the teach these people???
my 11 year old niece could have done a better job.
and the girl who did it kept telling me she was "addicted" to waxing.
maybe she needs to get addicted to learning about how to properly wax.
have gone to the location in gilbert and always had good luck.
2 thumbs down on this experience!!!!
the service is consistently terrible.
very unorganized and unprofessional.
unfortunate as it is very convenient to order online and pickup.
on monday i had a flat tire.
they did one sale, but i encourage everyone, if they need tires, go elsewhere.
i will never go back there and will encourage people not to go there.
the dermatologist was more than 2 weeks out so i set my appointment.
she couldn't believe that they could have done that.
few things here.
considering i had no other option i took the car.
this will be my last rental from this place.
if i hadn't been to the main street location,  i would never go back.
we ordered a french press, the coffee was extremely weak.
i told our server and she shrugged it off.
if you are in a hurry do not use advantage.
the seller sent me the incorrect couch.
i made the purchase on 8/15/15 and the estimated delivery was 8/25/15-8/28/15.
i wish i had looked at their yelp reviews before purchasing from them.
don't wait for me to call you back 45 minutes later.
my phone also takes incoming calls.
guys did very good job fixing my car after a small accident.
they've dealt with the insurance company and explained everything exceptionally well.
everything was superb.
they definitely take pride in what they do.
when i pointed it out, they've promised to replace it.
it's been three weeks of silence now.
they'll get 5 stars from me when they keep their promise.
i do not recommend.
portrait studio sucks!
they schedule appointments with 10 minute intervals and run 45-60 minutes behind!
they also only have 2 people working durning the busiest season for family pictures.
management here lacks common sense.
stay away from aamco!!
i got my car repairs at the scottsdale location..
nearly $2000 and have had problems ever since.
bottom line, this company is a scam and not worth wasting money here.
i received two hamburgers with lettuce and onion...no cheese or bacon.
in 3 years 3 dvr units stopped working ..
customer service ain't responding.
but after they drained  my oil!
kalbi, overcooked, charred and mostly bones.
terrible service and rude staff.
they haven't fixed the ac in i don't know how long.
it's uncomfortable every time i go in.
yelp says they open at 11:00am today.
their website says they open at 1:00pm today.
i got there around 1:30pm.
i walked in, and there were already two other tables seated.
he then said it would be at least another twenty minutes.
no. just no.
don't go there!
went there to get my car inspected.
