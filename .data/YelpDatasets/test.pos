i loved this buffet.
to me it was comparable to the buffet at the wynn.
tons of desserts as well!!
define lay coming back next trip to vegas..
what can you say about this place that hasn't already been said.
menu is often changing and new additions and recommendations are usually worth taking.
the "town & country" location is fashionable shabby chic, not intimidating.
parking is kind of a cluster.
look forward to coming here again on the next possible date night.
close proximity to downtown we decided to venture towards lickadee split on coxwell.
i have a soft-spot for soft-serve and confectioneries!
thankfully one was enough, both jen and i each took something we liked.
chocolate fudge was for her.
over-decadent, every chocolate-lovers love!
snobbish receptionist, good waiters, food is identical to any other cheese cake factory.
and finally they invented a slice of cake that's 1750 calories.
that's art !!!
but their 500 calorie " diet" cheesecake is pretty good.
empty at lunchtime !
i love it!
almost all options are available in a vegan version.
so i made one last trip today.
yoli's is a a great place to have breakfast.
the staff is wonderful and you always receive great customer service.
only my second maybe third time in life in outback.
i came late because that's how i roll.
i really don't enjoy a crowd.
headed straight for the bar which was pleasantly open.
my meal was a 11oz center cut steak, sweet potato and brocoli and cheese.
all the food was deliciously seasoned.
i'll be back
tommy did a great job.
no more harsh chemicals and horrible soaking in that poison!
everyone should try it.i totally recommend it.
customer service was spectacular, reasonably priced, and very satisfied with how my eyebrows look.
will definitely be coming back and recommend for anyone!
once you thread your eyebrows you will never want to wax them ever again.
everytime i'm in town i hit this place for curds, beer and brats.
i spent a whole sunday watching football here and had a blast.
crowded times are a little annoying, but it is a college place.
love the mustard selections too.
curds are a must!
..she's a fabulous bartender.
always gives us great service.
love the wahoo salad with fish.
i like neon.
well, i like a stiff drink and 70's decor.
somewhere in a previous life i wore nothing but polyester.
more like miami vice, or maybe boogie nights.
either way, environment is always friendly, or intimate, depending on what you wish.
super quick service from car to terminal and vice versa.
the cheap rates are also great and you can always find coupons online.
perfect place to relax after our red rock adventures!!
great drinks and great food.
definitely try the philly fries.

best place to get a tattoo, hands down.
the shop is very clean.
you won't be disappointed in your work if you go here!!!
local breeze is one of my favorite restaurants in the city.
my favorite part about this place is that they have a dog friendly patio.
try the coca cola ham omelet for brunch....ah-mazing!
we love this pastries shop during our stayed in montreal.
however this place is so good.
services are reasonable priced and they are honest.
what they quoted was 200% more expensive then what colburn worked on for us.
i called the office and asked why they are so expensive.
the person on the phone told us that, "we are the best"....
let's just say we will definitely use colburn enterprises again and again.
great columbian street food place.
we got the hot dogs, columbian style, empanada and yucca.
fugu was ok, but overpriced and their delivery is slow.
ichiban seemed just ok.
i've tried others with no luck.
finally i tried double 10, and i'm soooooo happy!
it's really good, but also way cheaper than anything else i've found in town.
i really liked the garlic sauce they have.
they also had super fast service.
this is my new go to chinese place!
first time here and everything was amazing.

he really understood my budget limits and had very affordable solutions to my problems.
i am short.
pants are always waaaay too long.
she always does a wonderful job and is very upfront about her pricing.
i would be heartbroken if she ever closed up shop.
it is worth the 30 minute trip for us to get there.
a cute little place with games, great service and is clean.
was able to get in for 2 pedicures late on a friday evening.

the night shift, wow what service.
truly like that i grew up on in alabama and georgia!
the variety and quality of the sides add to the experience all the more.
i just wish they had the amazing peach cobbler everytime i visit!
it's as close to grandma's as your going to get!
by far the best mexican food we have had in las vegas.
the fideo soup was loaded with flavor and so we're the salsas.
the service was impeccable, we will definitely be back soon.
pretty unique place!
the food was awesome, and i met o.j. simpson in the order line!
the rail does a lot of things right.
the food is fresh, well-priced, and tasty.
i will say, though, that the service really hits it out of the park!
for instance, long island iced teas are $3 all day on fridays.
keep up the good work rail, i love ya.
food is amazing, fresh, yummy.
service is fast and staff is professional and over the top attentive.
i love this place!

the servers are fast, polite and attentive and the owner is very personable.
he is always present and gives everyone personal attention.
went here because my girlfriend loves greek food.
my ipad air screen was completely smashed, so i researched screen repairs.
needless to say, it was very expensive to repair.
they received it on a friday, and i got it back the next friday.
i received my ipad air back in pristine and like-new condition.
it had been packed nicely and securely upon arrival.
best jerk ever!
this place is super good.
it's mostly a take-away business but either way, you can't go wrong.
thanks yelp, for suggesting this place!
never would have noticed it otherwise.
this review is for the pharmacy in general and my pharmacist, marc, in particular.

our daughter's car broke down en route to vegas to attend edc.
aaa took her to tony and thank goodness.

reminds me of oak park, il.
has that "small town downtown" vibe.
we really enjoyed our trip!!!

perfectly seasoned, moist and tender.
my wifes eggplant pork was just as good with a totally different flavor profile.

prices were fair to begin with, but happy hour made them even better!
coming back for sure if i'm ever in vegas!
the good- the cupcakes are just amazing!
i could go on and on but these things rock!
they are giant and in no way could you eat one in one bite.

they definitely did not disappoint.
nice relaxed and minimalistic atmosphere.
pierogis were definitely the highlight.
was told that they will be rotating types of pierogis in the future.
the borscht was very good, a seemingly simple broth with a nice complex flavor.
they make an awesome hot pepper oil/sauce too.
everything i've tried so far has been great.
hope that they will expand their menu in the future.
make sure to try a cocktail too!
the burrito was awseome.
you tell them what kind of meat you want.
then you move to another station to pick your toppings.
the fries were a whole different story, couldn't stop eating them.
that's how good the fries were.
boy were we delighted by the pastries!
we went back the next day to get more to share with family.

well deserving of 5 stars.
adam the flight instructor was awesome!!!
we selected the high flight as an add on and it was worth it.

there is a wait, then some instruction, and finally jumpsuit coordination.
the flights are a few minutes long, but worth the time and $$.

it feels like the food is made with love!

great food that mostly seems to be made in house.
the prepackaged house salad was surprisingly delicious!
excellent customer service and a willingness to customize dishes.

one of my favourite places in montreal.
the food is great and their drink selection is varied and ever-changing.
the decor almost screams canadiana but with a very accommodating style.

they make you feel like family and they treat my daughter like their own.
we just couldn't believe how realistic these little soaps looked like cupcakes!

for they do offer a lot of things that sparks my interest.
plus, all natural, grass fed, bone in ribeye.

are you kidding me?!
don't leave without having the dog jam or amazing cashew spread on something!
food is always excellent and so is the service.
if you make it during holiday season, you should try the salted caramel martini.
goatfeathers is not like this.
goatfeathers has various sections made up of different people's collection of wares for sale.
the trick is finding that particular area that speaks to your interest.
they always have everything i need (mainly ammo and fishing supplies).

this is my all time favorite mexican restaurant in the phoenix area.
we have been there several times, and always find it a delightful evening.
took the yogurt and sat outside near the fountains which was a nice bonus.
i think i ate the entire cup in about 4 big bites.
just terrible.....so needless to say...go..run...speed down to this place.
the house coffee is great, as well.
it's not overpowering like starbuck's, and it's always piping hot.
great place to relax between classes.
if you are served by alberto, you are in good hands.

i will have dreams about that chicken for a long time!
the pulled pork poutine was also really yummy.
the jalapeos were a nice touch.
fries were fresh and they used curds (bonus points for not using shredded cheese).

i felt as though i'd slipped into a parallel dimension.
recommended it already to our family and friends.
we live maxwell's.
the burgers are incredible, and the wings are almost as good.

my only semi negative comment is that the breakfast sandwich was just okay.
wasn't bad, just okay.
major thumbs up to this location though!

it was time.
they took out the overgrown plants and made all livable again.
the crew did the fall trimming and cleanup and planted some roses.
a great job again!
my roses just dropped in this week's frost.
the only drawback is that they do not trim trees.
so glad captain's boil has opened up all across the city!
i no longer have to go to the states to enjoy delicious seafood.
the fresher the better

hoping they open one near home.
i had, possibly, the longest wait ever at a chipolt.
of all time.
however, every bite was so good!
excellent heat level and really great smokiness.

we will return to even stevens again!
great experience, quick pick up and return ( gold member).
they have serviced our car a few times for various ailments.

the lard beef salad is very good too.
i walked in and was helped immediately.
not one but two came to my rescue.
keyla and adam thank you.
i flew in from miami with a malfunctioning apple watch.
it takes a 2-3 week wait to get an appointment at home.
walk ins 3-4 hours.
i walked out with a functioning watch within 25 minutes.

i'm in awe and a very happy customer.
might just have to fly to vegas when i have apple trouble.
love this place.
i felt like a princess staying here!
it was gorgeous!
i hope to go back soon!
review update:still the best fish and zucchini i've ever had.
the portions are still giant, so two meals for me.

are here all the time when i worked closer to it.
it's one of my favorite sushi burrito places in town.
great menu and everything is good.
i saw i love lucy at the royal alex and it was fantastic.
the theatre is a wonderful preserved piece of history.
i don't understand these people that complain about the close quarter seating.....

great food, awesome service!!
i really enjoyed the experience at topgolf and would definitely go back again!

in my opinion this is the epitome of customer service!
fellow service industry worker approved.
had a great time service was fantastic and the employees were super helpful.

at each step of the process, we were pleasantly surprised.
there was always a supervisor checking the job as we progressed.
we had no problems with cleanup after each stage.
we simply could not have asked for more!!
i honestly don't know where the negative reviews are coming from.
they must have this place confused with another men's wearhouse.

best example: the monte carlo hotel and casino in las vegas.
it was beautiful new but just aged so quickly and noticeably.
caesar's palace, bellagio, wynn, and the venetian have all been meticulously maintained.

could have done without the spiced watermelon and left the spices off.
i think was cayanne pepper.
overall lots of food for two to share.
delish deep fried chicken and a wealthy amount.
waffles are waffles...
a nice margarita did the trick to cool me down.
i had the salmon tropical.
it was the best salmon i had ever eaten.
even mine at home couldn't top this one.
the salmon was not only moist, but the sauce around it was devine.
she was friendly, attentive, accurate and accommodating.
great time was had by all last night!

give this place a shot and you won't be sorry.
ran in on a whim.
smell smacks you in the face...fresh, baked doughnuts.
not a huge variety...looked like it had had the sunday rush go through already.
but we got a dozen, 4/5 types and everyone raved about each type.
they were all soft, warm and fresh.
from the basic, plain cakes...to the elaborate, cream filled.
highly recommended...and we will be back.
