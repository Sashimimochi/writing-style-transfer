don't even think they realized we walked in.
however everyone at the bar noticed we walked in!!!
service was non existent at best.
not a good way for a new business to start out.
staff is not nice, very rude.
and it was a big mistake.
i explained what i wanted to the stylist, and even showed two photos.
i was mortified and now trying to grow this hideous cut out.
nothing is blended and she butchered my hair.
and to make matters worse, she wasn't even friendly!
heading to a different salon today to try and get it fixed.
place took forever...
but they didn't even let me know what was going on!
never going back
my experience went from bad to worse.
this place is filthy and the employees are extremely rude.
i went back first thing in the morning to pick up the item.
i was told that the finance charge was double for being a day late.
what a mess.
should've stuck with the company i usually use....next counter or two over.
came here based on sw airlines suggestion and email.
will not offer refund and will charge you for cancelled flight.
even a month in advance i tried and they will not work with me.
dont use this cut rate airline
don't go here.
especially not for a full hour table massage.
i'll spare the details, but i definitely don't recommend this place.
but they are consistently, unfailingly, disrespectful.
i will never in my life come back here again.
the girl told me it would take 45 min to print.
i don't travel to chandler often and live 30min from this location.
i told them they needed to mail it to me and i left furious.
very disappointing, the price is too expensive for the food quality.
secondly, way too much rice on the sushi.
i guess thats how they make the money.
lastly, the ipad service is stupid.
you have to wait for someone to confirm it.
overall, not a good reataurant for sushi.
do not use.
should be call unreliable towing service.
never showed up.
kept saying they were minutes away
worst starbucks ever!!!!
so would not suggest this starbucks to stop into...
frybread is good, but there isn't enough substance.
i got some watered down beans, hardly any ground beef and mostly lettuce.
yeah, service continues to go downhill.
take your money elsewhere.
paid for the works.
they didn't even wipe the dash or any of the interior.
outside still has crap all over it.
should have gone back inside and asked for a refund.
this place sucks.
flies on the pizza that was sitting out there.
ew.  very disgusting.
i would not recommend it ...
so....they changed their prices.
one star because the girl at the counter was sweet.
i used to get the grilled chicken pasta for 9.00 and now it's 15.00!
i can't afford to go back.
i think loyalty supercedes trying to make an extra buck.
be loyal to your customers and they will return.
the pasta is good, but not olive garden in california  great.
i'll never understand why food tastes better in cali.
by the time i got it home it was rubbery.
(is that a word?) anyway, yuck!
we won't be back.
denny's food at beverly hills prices.
one star is for the decor not the food.
worst eggs benedict i have had in my entire life.
bacon is dry.
hollandaise sauce is tasteless and bland.
same for my other half.
belgian waffle saggy.
whipped cream from 99 cent store.
maple syrup is liquid sugar with water.
very  dissaiponting breakfast !!!
food was stodgy and fairly tasteless, and some dishes were cold.
save your calories for something else.
not a fan.
overpriced, over cooked bland burgers.
everything is extra (fries, onion rings).
i will never rented from them.
that company required us a annual fee for one time unlocked.
finally, we ended up to talk hotel and they called a local key company.
even when i called for unlocking key, they said we do not have insurance.
bad staff...staff was not welcoming at all .
with raised tone and bad .
i left with my 2boys from there without getting haircut .
will not go again .
bad bad staff....they do not have a curtesy to talk to a customer .
what a shock!
had philly cheese steaks coast to coast including philly.
or cincinnati chili.
twice now they've let me down at the islington store.
i drove quite a distance to this store.
that was the last time.
they are a confused bunch at the new islington store.
lots of other places to find tools.....
well we waited forever to get our food.
what a shame.
doubt i will be back.
service was awful.
broccoli raab was a few steamed frozen broccoli crowns that was sent immediate back.
go anywhere but here, especially if you want a nice meal like we did.
horrible service and communication.
too many options in charlotte to give this place my business.
incredibly, egregious customer service.
the most bland tasting italian food that i have ever had!
unfortunately, the only good thing was the cappacino.
very over priced as well!
garlic bread was decent.
we had linguine and clams,manicotti,and lasagna.
each dish was equally lackluster.
we ordered sisig and they told us it would be ready at 12:30.
the lady at cash didn't even care or apologize and was rude.
i'll never go back there
do not eat the gf crust if you have celiac!!!
it's definitely not gf.
it's also very pricey given the quality of the actual pizza.
definitely a big no-no.
no shuttles running.
no one at the gate to give directions.
i missed my flight because of no service.
what a waste of money will never step foot in this store again ...
notice they didn't even get high ratings in this location...
customer service is zero!!!!
i was shocked that a half of southwest chicken salad was $6.00.
not to mention it was not big at all.
it was worth perhaps $4.00 total
these posers don't allow dogs on their patio.
way to turn away customers!
suck it nerds!!
gameplay is fun but horribly disorganized facility.
bartenders are slow.
we could have had 2 drinks before they even took our order.
like doritos without flavoring.
music was awful.
typical scottsdale douche baggery, except with no sense of business and lame customer service.
prices are also on the high end making the experience even worse.
we actually had to walk to the front to pay .
service at its finest ....
choose a different airline!
initially,  i was a fan of allegiant.
not weather, not atc, but all mechanical issues.
done, gone, repossessed!
waited in line for over an hour.
no idea why this is so slow.
will never use budget again.
time and time again, tracking shows as delivered, package nowhere to be found.
avoid like a plague!
the place had a stale odor when we walked in.
we thought we would still give it a chance.
i wanted a moscow mule.
no such luck.
we left after the first drink.
i'm sure this was exciting for many people.
i, however, could not wait for the torture to end.
too loud, uncomfortable chairs and sucky if you're not a beatles fan.
maybe the "regular" cirque show would have been a more worthwhile experience.
worst mac location ever!!!
i really don't know how some of these people have jobs.
i went here for lunch today, craving a green chile burrito.
burrito was a great size for the price, the green chile sauce was okay.
walked in when the patio was empty.
asked for a table for 2.
advised of a 20 minute wait based on reservations.
45 minutes later we still had no table and the patio was empty.
had to leave as soon as we saw the room.
dead roaches on the bench/couch by window.
they were rude.
and filthy rooms.
i strongly suggest to not even think about staying there.
deserves no stars because it's really a crappy place.
i paid for my shake, never drank it and went on my way.
feel free to contact me if you want all the issues.
i was quite disappointed with it.
water all mucky, not much greenery or botany.
even if you do want to go for a stroll, it's very small.
i don't know, maybe i came at the wrong time?
wasn't worth the drive and looking for parking..
if i could give this place a zero, i would.
we had top shelf margaritas.
basically good tequila with very bad store mix and a little guest fruit fly.
atmosphere and service was about the same.
this was the worst pizza i have ever had.
the cheese and sauce had both a sour taste and smell.
the crust was bland and hard.
the service is terrible.
we did our orders in shifts, and i was among the first few.
be prepared for a long wait with indifferent apology.
won't be ordering from here again.
not worth the money and they obviously don't care.
my 1st choice of fast food failed because it closed early..
so my husband said panda..
wow years since ive been here and what a sad mess..
everyone in front of me wanted stuff they were out of ..
place was busy but out of food..
lots of walk outs and people waiting 6-10 mins for orders..
truly horrible service to both the dog and the human.
take your dog literally anywhere else.
you are paying to have your dog crated all day.
seems there was a note to call me.
most awesome customer service ever.
will never use or recommend.
be careful ladies.
beef brisket only available once a week.
i tried the sub and i'd rather go to subway for a similar sandwich.
do yourself a favor and go with any other cleaning service.
this week we were suppose to receive our bi-weekly clean at 10:00 on tuesday.
well 10 rolls around then 11 and still no maids.
the cleaning was suppose to be free- well we were then charged.
manager could careless and waiter said i hope it's nothing i did.
it was a waste of time, i wish i can have that back.
i would not recommend mary ann!
the first time she did my hair it was perfect!
disappointing experience overall!!!
attempted to apply for a position.
i was treated with such disrespect by the management.
for a quality company i could not believe the way they treat applicants
this shit is ass!!
worst one yet!!
food wasn't good, horrible quality!
bread looks like it's on crack, not even soft or toasted.
2nd time & its ass..
only go if the other one is closed
they think we women don't know what their talking about.
my truck was just serviced 6 months ago before moving to vegas.
will be taking this straight to their corporate office.
do not waste your time or money.
not worth any perceived savings.
"priority" is a scam.
rip off from start to finish.
went to pay for 5 magazines.
talked to manager who just said that's their system.
won't be going back.
honesty is not company policy.
the sandwiches are messy.
this was absolutely disgusting.
i got the unchicken and waffles and i threw up within an hour.
i'll never come back.
service was fine but the food ruined it for me.
told 1 hour.
so had someone called or come to the door...
would have seen it.
finally another hour later, they showed up with my meal.
philly was cold and stale and the fries were also cold and soggy.
plus, you shouldnt eat food that has been sitting at room temp that long.
your service may be good but your shuttle drivers are crazy.
a shuttle is billboard with your name on it.
and it's a bad representation of your brand.
*red flag when the pharmacy technician confuses acetaminophen for psudoephedrine.
so dropped off a prescription at 2pm on thursday was told 1 hour.
we sat at the bar and met the arrogent bartenderi asked for horseradish.
it took 10 minutes and never came.
i would not recommend this business to anyone in the area.
his behavior was bigoted and unacceptable.
the b7 i ordered looks/tastes nothing like night market fried chicken tender in taiwan.
vegetable on the side is over cooked.
my friend and i have diarrhea after eating at phusion cafe...
this place is a slave camp and so unprofessional.
mgmt participates in favoritism.
the hr department is a joke.
mgrs sleeping with staff members...
i would have to say i had the worst experience visiting this property.
the assistant property manager was so unprofessional.
as we walked through the door she did not even acknowledge us.
the apartments are so awkward.
they are so small.
if you have the opportunity to view others properties do it.
will not go back here for anything.
it's a very loud buffet and over price
unfortunately, this administrative fee will prevent me from ever going back.
it's sad b/c i feel the care was really great.
never had the urge to write a review til now.
this attraction is just way too boring!
dont waste your money here!
kathy and laura on staff are extremely rude and dismissive.
i will never set foot in this venue again.
to treat vendors like they are servants and somehow beneath them is disgusting.
apparently, this is kathy's known reputation around town.
yet, somehow she still has a job.
agree with other reviews- avoid this company if you can!
over an hour in line and still waiting...
won't be surprised if they're out of cars when i get to the front!
the quote was fair; however, not the best and so we chose another company.
they are yet to return  my call.
this is not a company i will ever use.
why are there no pre made flower arrangements???
it looks so tacky.
thank you for wasting my time fry's.
i was in a rush and chose to stop here, lesson learned.
i will drive the extra 5 blocks to safeway!
i don't like the word he said "done" what is that mean?
this place is a bunch of "bs".
very poor customer service..
they don't even deserve a 1 star at all.
disaster for customer service.
i was quoted 15 minutes and waited 40.
people working there seemed clueless.
salad was terrible.
pizza very expensive.
the one in chandler is better.
stay away from this location!!!!
it's no wonder this place is now closed.
littering my neighborhood with stupid flyers stuffed into front doors is not welcome.
i called and asked for someone come remove the unsolicited flyers.
i wish i could give negative stars.
this restaurant was by far the worst restaurant i've ever dined at.
the service was awful.
buyer shouldn't not beware after this post.
the food was awful.
7 people struggled to eat the tapas and entires.
7 people should devour food not sit back and look at it.
robbed us of our money.
regret ever going there
what the heck has happened to this place!!??
there obviously has been a conscious decision to just let this place go.
the rent is far too high and is raised every year.
the apartments are tiny and very outdated.
don't waste your time looking here.
i'm so dissatisfied and disappointed.
the sooner i'm done with this place the better.
if i could give negative stars i would.
this school is the reason community colleges are looked down on.
it was not good.
there were 3 customers and it still took forever to get the food.
we were reluctant to leave any tip but gave a little something for goodwill.
rancho flooring installed a tile shower in my house.
worst experience ever!
i tried to order contacts online through another company because they were so expensive.
wtf is this?
he literally removed our names from the book
you will get a car at a cheap rate.
but it will be one beat up piece of crap.
staff are rude.
spend $20 more and go with another company.
there are 2 people on the line, one cashier.
this is absolutely insane and no way to run a chipotle.
needless to say i wasn't impressed by their customer service whatsoever.
don't bother checking this place out, it's not worth the time.
are our accounts are locked!
we are deff going back to our old bank.
if you need the fund right away due to an emergency guess what!
they don't allow it.
i did not even try the food, why?
rude and just for the money people.
to the owner: "take care of your place!"
i rather go to fine-dining restaurant.
i guess buffett is just never good
worst place ever.
very rude over the phone when trying to get directions.
thanks for making me drive across town and getting horrible service
i followed up a week later on 7/8, and still nothing.
um, pot, kettle?!)
this probably the smallest and most uncomfortable airlines i have ever flown with.
the prices are dirt cheap but you get what you pay for.
they are usually delayed.
they do not care about customer service but rather the money.
just got off the phone with this company.
i had an issue with couple of my devices.
wanted to fix a few phones and an ipad.
would not give me a price.
kept telling me that he did not know the price.
sounded very shady.
i will not come here for any repairs and neither should you.
went for breakfast!
food was horrible!
service was equally as bad!
if you want dry mashed potatoes this is your place!
it's 2pm on a wednesday wth?
this is a joke!
do not hit this place!!
be careful with your bill!
the first few times we wrote it off to mistakes...after that it seemed deliberate.
ask some of the regulars in there..consistent overcharge.
we will never go back after 5 times wrong bill.
drinks are terrible!
bartender has a really bad attitude every time we have been in there.
i feel like they assume that you are "too drunk to know".
it's really frustrating!!
we will never be back.
a patient for the past three years, with biannual check ups.
every time i leave after my appointment i ask myself why?
without a doubt the most screwed up business i have ever seen.
their "central" appointment center is a disaster.
they have supposedly been scheduling same for three days now.
overrated and just ok food ..
it was ultra expensive too..
avoid if you can...
it's better just to go to the buffet at ceasar's palace.
i got the foot reflexology for 45 mins.
the pressure was no good.
she actually started talking on the phone at one point.
i only came here because my friend wanted to...
my concerns were confirmed and i won't be back.
i scanned the racks looking for my size.
it was difficult because nothing is in order.
the sizes are all mixed up.
i tried on a few items but decided to pass.
it was like going to my first high end swap meet.
i will never go back.
food is ok, but the portion is half of chipotle for the same price.
staff is what i give the one star for.
not helpful and rude.
this store is awful.
forever 21 should have stuck with small stores.
i will not be shopping at the arrowhead location ever again.
update - it's been over two months.
i did not receive a call back.
the jury is still out as to how this will be resolved.
wow is right.
note to management- as a prospective client, i must do nothing.
leave your shelter attitude at home.
oh wait, i've actually been to many friendlier shelters.
we step aside and wait- 5 minutes later we hear- what was your order?
black or green?
needed 2 beds to sleep 4 people.
received a room with one bed and a chair.
no cot or extra blankets available.
this is extremely disappointing.
that's really all i have to say.
don't stay here if you can help it.
tried this restaurant for the first time today.
the pizza had tomato sauce.
purchased a remanufactured battery.
was wrong size for my truck and it fried my starter due to this.
i was told to goto another location to exchange it for the correct one.
that location sent me to a warehouse where they said no receipt no exchange.
i was not given one in first place.
and nobody offers to help you out with anything, either.
unfortunately that doctor was unavailable so i was paired with dr. howard.
the experience was horrible and the quality of care is non-existent.
this hospital does not care for its patients nor their well-being.
many times, i have pulled in and they have been out of gas!
also, if you go inside, they don't really keep anything else in stock either.
the service here was horrible.
also, the car was delivered late with poor communication from the service rep.
they are always understaffed and the majority of employees are surly.
expect to be interrogated if you want to make a return.
every time i come, there are long lines and extensive wait times for everything.
i'm sure people reading this review feel sympathy for the overly harassed employees.
i don't care how drunk you are.
avoid this place at all cost.
it's gross, and expensive.
don't eat here.
don't eat here.
don't eat here.
this location sucks.
the 2 females working when i came were so friggin rude wow..
i don't think i've ever been treated so rude for absolutely no reason.
save your time and go to another location!!
i eat out in vegas about 3 to 4 times a week.
first and last time at this restaurant.
don't waste your time.
this is my second time at this avis.
again not to please.
their customer service is terrible.
wow hadi, not much has changed since i worked for you.
still screwing your customers!!
yeah, i cant even properly review this place because we were actually just shunned.
i am blown away and confused.
great customer service....
plan to wait, they never see you on time, and im talking 2 hours.
on follow up i pointed out i was on digoxin......
the cause of the irregular heartbeat.
if you complain they send a letter saying they will no longer see you
came here for lunch after shopping.
i will never ever go to another t.g.i.fridays.
my server marissa or miranda would not serve me.
the host trent from the front that seated me had to serve me.
i'm  sure this had to do with the color of my skin.
to my put one star cause i needed it for this review.
i guess i have to find another favorite restaurant.
needless to say..
it was taken back and remade, however staff should be more attentive, and quick.
i called the "hotel doctor" last night.
told him my issue and he asked me to hold on.
the er happily took my money and helped me out.
the hotel doctor is a joke that just wants to overcharge desperate tourists.
what a horrible way to run a business!
sadly, i'm not going to review on the sushi.....
my wife and i were craving sushi and decided to try the sushi.
not extremely busy.
we waited what seemed liked forever to be seated.
we weren't asked about drinks and no water was ever brought to us.
we literally sat there 10 minutes wondering if we would get some service.
a few minutes later we decided to go elsewhere because we felt completely ignored.
had hi hopes for a non ayce sushi house.
we ordered delivery a week ago!
and the mac salad wasn't even homemade!
take  out menu was put in garbage so i can forget this whole ordeal!
been here before, and the food wasn't bad til today.
my chicken fried steak was burnt, and so was my sisters.
what topped it off today was my brother found an ant in his potatoes.
we weren't expecting that type of response.
anyway, needless to say we won't be back.
the food today was burnt, and had a bug in it.
the service today by linda was good.
she was nice, and very apologetic.
summer is the worst server in the world.
could not be bother doing her job.
i could have gotten better service at mcd's
aaliyah at the restaurant was super rude .
we ordered drinks and water with our food .
she never came back .
we asked another waitress after 20 minutes .
we finally got water and then our drinks .
they advertised a cheap daily rate on a mustang so i rented it.
i needed to keep the car 2 extra days.
everytime i call their automated system i get a "system error cannot complete".
until i get to the airport and return the car.
my $113 rental ballooned to $300.
and btw they still use 1980s dot matrix printers.
the service was dubious.
there was another sign saying an italian restaurant is coming soon.
is there a no star rating!?
i have bills to pay!
if you think these girls are real, get a grip.
i paid $95 for 100 "virtual" addresses only to find no such addresses existed.
however, we have not gotten good service from a technician named holly.
my mom is too nice to complain, but i am not.
this is unacceptable and holly will never receive our family's money again.
i would've declined it, but we came to panda specifically for that dish.
so we said we'd wait.
my husbands food sat out, getting cold, while we waited closer to  15 minutes.
invoiced 300 for the car ended up being close to 600.
dont trust this company.
its more than ruined for me now.
however i have decided to focus on the future.
not dwell on the past.
then we didn't leave until scheduled time.
of course the a/c didnt work.
not bad enough?
flight attendants were so  rude on both flights.
next time i will pay the $100 more.
they obviously dont care
jan 15th, 16order my pizza extra well done and it came under cooked.
only had 2 slices!!!
maybe store #41 is just that much better than the others...again, very pleased overall.
i went in for lunch and forgot my rings there.
shockingly expensive, poor quality food.
the inside seating area was dirty and felt like a denny's in disguise.
do not waste your hard earned cash here!
went there on 1/3/2014 after purchasing vouchers for myself and 2 friends.
the massage was not the best.
the pressure was inadequate.
we had to comply in order to leave.
it was very uncomfortable.
the management is not very cooperative.
our party of over 20 people will never have a party here.
will go somewhere else.
the tenders were rubbery and super salty!
the mashed potatoes tasted like instant!
canes is way tastier down the street!
i was very upset at this location.
they proceeded to walk into the ice cream shop.
now...any good suggestions on a new ice cream spot?
then another family behind them also asked to sit upstairs and was also refused.
definitely won't be coming back.
if i could give negative stars i would!
these people are very nasty, rude, uncivilized scum of the earth.
trying to charge me almost $900.00 and it increases daily!
i can not even start to tell you how horrible these scum bags are!
the food has went from excellent to okay.
i patronized this place after a year of reprieve.
i was disappointed in the changes and service.
we had a table with a cocktail  waitress who never showed up.
when questioned she acted like she had no idea of her mistake.
the male manager was cocky and unprepared for a professional encounter.
did the owner hire his neighbor???
locals, don't come here...
it's not the same
you could be very respectful but for some reason this girl just has issues.
she is condescending, the way she speaks is disrespectful, and she screams at customers.
luckily i was not burned as some other people i heard about were.
if i could give them negative stars i would!!!!!!
they are the biggest scam artist!
this place is awful!
i had to be the one to flag her down and get something.
i also heard her talking to her manager and she only had 2 tables!!!
us and the table next to us and basically ignored us the whole time.
i will never be back to this location!
we came in just before 8:00 on sunday night.
two young men told us that they were already closed.
i think they just wanted to go home early.
i'm a loyal customer and being pregnant i was really craving a salad.
i'll think twice before returning to this location.
worst outback i've been too.
first time they gave away my order yo wrong client at curbside takeaway.
go to the outback on chandler blvd and 54th street.
better service all around.
shame on me for going back a second time to this location.
food was not worth the wait.
they should fix the a/c immediately.
on top of everything else the staff was horrible
i originally fired the first company that my insurance recommended.
i would never recommend them to anyone.
i'm still waiting for out to be complete.
anytime we had an appointment i had to remind them of it.
the seem to poor small jobs at the bottom of the priority list.
this review is for the service.
one word, slow.
had to ask 5 times to get extra small plates.
water had to ask mutuel time before refill.
need more staff.
we bought an ottoman and less than 3 months later the casters broke.
the customer service to get it fixed has been terrible!!!
we will never shop there again!!
i would give 0 stars if possible.
their hash browns always taste bad and the employees are very rude.
definitely avoid this timmies.
appalling customer service.
today, the 2 so-called sales people were extremely rude.
after waiting for them to acknowledge us, we finally interrupted their conversation.
they laughed and said oh, we're having a discussion.
i thought you were minding the store.
i've bought shoes there before and would have bought again today.
will not support a place that allows customers to be treated this way.
too bad it has been a west valley staple but something bad has happen.
don't come to this location!
umm straight out they are a huge scam.
ever since i stopped going to them, haven't had a problem since.
i'm a huge marvel fan but this attempt at a museum is a failure.
avoid this one.
nfl football on and i'm listening to casey kasum tip hits from 1978.
what is the target demographic?
this isn't the only time i left due to terrible ambiance.
i hope they will find an identity.
wow what a crazy first impression!!!
completely disrespectful of people's time !!!
do yourself a favor and rent from a reputable car rental company.
they mislead you on the pricing you get when you make an online reservation.
don't be fooled by the friendly staff.
they work hard to hide the game they are playing.
food lacks flavor.
service is slow.
a bit overpriced.
sitting at the table right now.
have not even received the food and already have awful service.
save yourself the time and get off instead.
we went to auditorium 2.
very ordinary seats which resembled me of theatres 20 years ago.
the most horrible part was the overpowering smell due to non-maintenance and probably bedbugs.
may not be going again.
i visited this location of frederick for the first time yesterday for take out.
the food was just okay.
i've even had a more satisfactory meal at tangerine's during their lunch specials.
finally left the restaurant at 10 a total waste of time.
i am scheduled for another tech to come and "fix" the problem.
what ever happened to getting what you paid for in this world????
i had to reconnect three times to write this review.
the food was just right like any other japanese restaurant..
not surprising but don't get me wrong..
they taste good.
the other table asked for the bill as soon as their food arrived...
everyone waited avg of 2hrs to get their order.
the food was good.
we got fried rice, honey walnut shrimp and chicken eggrolls.
it was fast and tasted fresh.
first red flag the place was completely empty at 7:00pm.
we were very unimpressed with this dish.
placed an order over the phone and confirmed my price.
go to pick it up and went from $40 to $50.
left the food there and walked out.
really really wanted to try this place.
there are approximately 60 channels dedicated to nothing but infomercials!
maybe we've been spoiled by the spectacular indian buffet in niles, oh.
this was so disappointing.
selection was sparse, salad wilted.
food that was there was only ok.
naan was burned and when gone no more was brought.
staff mostly absent and unfriendly.
overall very sad.
not sure where the good reviews came from.
find somewhere else to go.
noticed they are canceling so many flights,  allegiant you are on your way out!!
thanks great clips
finally another server took our order.
the waiter came over to apologize and told us they were "slammed".
after waiting another 30 minutes for our order, we gave up and left.
we invested 45 minutes for nothing.
avoid this mcdonalds, not even sry for wait !
the food was really bad!
it was too expensive!!
180 for 2 people.
not worth it.
also the customer service was awful
one star for joannes customer service tonight.
i put all of my stuff down and walked out
decided to get swiss chalet, but very disappointed with the service.
these people are definitely not happy with their job.
i tried to be polite and courteous but not even a smile.
will never be going back to a swiss chalet period!
no excuse for lackluster treatment of customers!
being under new management, late night out partying???
not impressed at all with this location.
the server julie r.
will not be back at this location again.
we had an appointment for 6:50 and we are still waiting 30 minutes later.
we are just told there are 2 people ahead of us.
another 20 maybe.
the service by store manager was very rude.
there are better jewish deli's just down summerlin parkway.
i don't mean complicated orders either.
also fyi the reuben is like a $20 plate - and bland!
do yourself a favor and skip this place.
the worst service of all mcdonald's places i've ever been!!
gave me a wrong order and won't apologize.
they took them away and took ten minutes to add and melt the cheese.
the burgers were inedible at that point.
they chose to "comp" our sodas as an apology.
thanks for a shit meal and zero apologies for crap service.
wont go back even if it's a free meal.
first you'll notice there is nobody eating inside.which says a lot about the food.
i've had the pizza,it's not that good.
the owner is a azzhole!
please go elsewhere.
to future customers: spend your money elsewhere unless you want to be rudely berated.
an absolutely disgusting example of montreal customer service.
so glad i didn't end up spending money here after they insulted me.
i will never spend money at another amir restaurant ever again.
this place doesn't need our money.
i doubt any new yorkers would waste their money on these wannabe bagels.
so who knows.
waiter disappeared for the whole dining experience before we even got our food.
had to stay in our hotel room instead of going out that night.
u guyz messed it up our dinner....
i'm a sushi purist.
please no fusion crap.
serve me my fish off straight from the waters onto my rice.
don't you serve sushi?
doesn't it say that in the name of your restaurant?
this company is very miss leading, the advertise $25.00 repair & service.
to once be a king is delightful but to be a queen?
burgers don't come with fries, nor any side of that matter.
however, upon my initial visit, i was not impressed.
after this experience, i will not be back.
i work in the office park where this place is located.
i will eat there only out of desperation.
their food is mediocre at best.
they charge you to pay with a debit/credit card.
the old owners were very nice people and very fair.
get your act together before you start losing customers and shut down forever.
called today and left a vm.
here starts the waiting game.
(got a groupon, too late to cancel and i don't want the credits.
this has to work out).
*follow up (6/6): ramsey just returned my call.
rescheduled for tomorrow wed 6/7 for 11-1130a.
thank you sir!
originally quoted one price and it went up by almost double upon delivery.
dishonest and unprofessional.
slow service and more expensive then the usual sushi spot.
lots of people waiting on their dinner and no waitress in sight!
more expensive to eat in then take out.
no stars would be a more accurate rating.
my feet feel like sand paper after a pedicure.
their recommendation: go home and put some vaseline.
more nail polish on my toes than on my nails.
never going back.
the doctors are limited in time and knowledge.
not to mention an average office visit is $175.
the staff often seemed clueless and rude.
not sure how or if there is any regulatory organization monitoring this tragedy.
told is it would be an hour wait, it took 2.
we will not be back.
jersey solar has apparently left town.
their phone numbers either return a busy signal or indicate not in service.
emails are returned as undeliverable.
we have been in verona for about a year now.
we have brought our children here and liked the food.
recently we are remodeling our kitchen and eat here about once a week.
we do not sit at the bar and our children are fairly well mannered.
very disappointed in our service this evening.
leaving your skin feeling burned and inflamed.
so i kept my mouth shut.
do not eat here!
overpriced food that tastes horrible and a staff with a bad attitude.
there are plenty of other great buffets on the strip!
do yourself a favor avoid this place.
what the hell happened?
went here again, exact same time of year, one of the same servers....
the place was dead and i see why!
wow, what a decline.
last year was so great, the place was rammed and times were good.
the worst turnaround i have ever seen.
how do you mess up a denny's?
the atm machine never lets you deposit cash.
saigon kitchen is not representative of vietnamese food.
anyone who calls this great vietnamese food simply has never tasted real vietnamese food.
have been going here since moving to phoenix 1 1/2 years ago.
previous visit was given wrong order (1 item).
few days later mgr issued a credit to use at later date.
went back few nights ago prior to dinner rush.
after waiting 35 minutes asked clerk for my food (again 1 burrito).
was advised given to wrong person, but found it for me.
got home again with the wrong item.
the buffet at the bellagio has gone downhill in a big way.
service was also not very good.
don't waste your money here.
this woman is rude and i avoid this location solely because of her.
don't go to this location.
you'll just get hassled.
won't be back and won't be recommending.
wouldn't even give 1 star!
horribly tasting food and really bad service!
while they server placed the fajitas,  2/4 brocollis fell out..
they forgot the add the 1/3 part of the fajitas - the sweet potato!
the quinoa super bowl was so bad!
over all horrible experience!
never going back here..
dr. zak is very unprofessional and hateful.
there is a difference between 'not sugar coating things' and being completely inappropriate.
you always wait at least an hour to see her because she's "running late".
if i could give zero stars i would.
do not go here if you are pregnant.
ordered lettuce wraps.
they were served to our table dirty.
with a sizable clump of black dirt on one of them.
sent them back of course.
fresh lettuce was then served.
new york style pizza.
it was okay.
parmesan cheese is not fresh, unfortunately.
oh no...do not let this team and his people near your property.
these property managers really know how to rip people off!
i joined ted and his team of crackpots to basically steal their money.
may he be judged by a higher being doing mobster work here on earth.
you have been warned.
do not sign anything ted writes up.
he's no good in my opinion.
as a big fan of pokebowls, i was a bit disappointed by the place.
the result turned out unexpected.
it was very unbalanced and i found it too pricey for what it was.
with tax and tips i paid 22$ for a pokebowl...
don't think i would come back.
stopped by the store.
we had $1,000 in a fsa account we needed to spend.
we were ignored as other customers, who came in after us, were waited on.
after 15 minutes, we decided they must not want our $1,000 so we left.
lots of paces to buy rx glass....no need to be treated like this.
they care more about fast money than being a quality spa.
i work down the street and will never return.
instead i'll walk another 5mins to a quality salon.
please take a patients allergies seriously when the clearly spell them out for you.
oh and have you ever heard of hippa?
yelp doesn't let you give zero stars, more important that others are made aware.
zero stars actually!
over priced, not the best menu and terrible service.
don't waste your money or time!
i found a coupon on groupon because i needed my apartment cleaned.
i e-mailed them for a refund and have not heard back.
to say i'm disappointed and livid is a huge understatement.
this is right next to my apartment but it's just not worth going to.
there's not a great selection of alcohol and the food is over priced.
it also takes forever to figure out where you're going to sit...
if you can walk in there and buy something, more power to you.
however, if you are an internet shopper, try again.
their answering machine is even full!
all in few words .
not clean , hallways ; carpets.
besides not sure about how managment handles asigning rooms.
two nights in a row there were like 50 kids plus  parents .
anyhow we called the front  desk  and they didn't care.
anyhow an advise for everyone..
she did not apologize for her poor judgment and attitude.
i told her since i had paid cash that would be difficult.
she said she would see to it i got a full refund.
so, not only are they inefficient, she's a liar.
horrible airport burrito i ever had.
even worse, they charge you extra for everything, right from cheese, sauce, and guac.
an usual burrito with all the usual ingredients will make it to $20 here.
such a daytime robbery for a tasteless burrito.
we went through hell with michael aldridge and his less than qualified rude staff.
stay clear, find a true professional.
this is a horrible business.
had 2 fradulant transactions from this company on my credit card.
this place is not good at all.
i had a chicken salad sandwich.
it was very bad, bread was hard and salad had no flavor.
don't waste your money, even subway has better sandwiches.
horrible customer service.
we'll go to another location.
don't think i'll be back, i paid $14.95 for fat.
every time i get take out, i try something new.
it was the most delicious dish i've had in a very long time a.
the service is always top notch and quick.
i definitely recommend this place!
$10 admission for kids tournaments and the acs don't even work!
on top of that, selling warm water in an already sauna of a gym.
good food but recent price changes are way beyond reasonable.
used to pop in for take-out of $10 entrees.
a 40% increase-   cashew chicken was $10, now $15.....
a 50% increase-    mango salad was $6, now $8 ....
a 33% increase.
i understand raising prices as costs go up but really?
this is beyond reasonable so won't be going back.
d- no goodmy house was flood damaged.
all floors needed replaced, dry wall repairs, entire interior painted, and new base boards.
laminate flooring and tile work looks good but paint job no good.
finish work terrible!
tried to cut corners hoping we wouldn't catch it.
left the house a mess.
i won't hire these guys again nor will i recommend them.
disappointing, expected more coming from guy.
checked in and was told 15-30 min wait.
we were told they were vip.
then, ordered and waited forever.
breakfast was subpar.
eggs bland and over cooked, potatoes not fresh, syrup watery.
overall, a total waste of time.
food is good and the only reason to dine at this pita jungle.
service is very poor and management is careless.
takeout  is also a miserable experience.
this is one of the worst experiences i have ever had.
the customer service at this location is horrible.
i have a contractor account and came to purchase some 4x6x12 treated posts.
with four employees standing around doing nothing, we found what we needed.
when we realized how big these were we tried to ask for some help.
every one disappeared.
we went to timber town and we were in and out within 15 minutes.
we went there on new year's eve.
food was terrible.
i got prime rib medium.
it was like shoe leather.
my family's meals were bad as well.
very expensive and not worth it.
look at many other reviews that rate it at a 1 or 2.
i am a medium height woman with fairly narrow hips.
you get into position, buckle up, and stay exactly in place for the flight.
and bring your water along.
theirs is $2.
i get paying extra for food and drinks, but water?
worse establishment ever.
place went to shit.
cover charges is more than any of the clubs in vegas.
the security are pricks.
they lost my id and didn't take accountability for it.
the bartenders take forever to get to you so good luck getting a drink.
honestly i will never go back to this place.
the food was at best ok.
my fav part was the sushi ginger they incorporated into the pickled veg..
well then there is no problem at all!!
my wife already wrote a review, but i feel very offended, as well.
i went into rc willey on stephanie to purchase a new dishwasher.
i feel i was discriminated against because of my sexual orientation.
i can't believe this just happened.
we will not be returning.
come on rc willey, we have money to spend just like the straight people.
not to mention that our server said the menu was missing some items...
wow this explains a lot!
save your time, money & gas.
she takes customer service calls.
what a biased opinion by an employee!
just another deceitful ploy by this company.
it's worn down and all around gross looking.
i'd rate this place negative stars if i could.
will not return, and would not recommend this place.
first thing i noticed was two employees eating a waffle off the same plate.
they weren't on break just eating while working.
the kitchen floor was filthy with food all over the floor near the grill.
the employees just walked through it.
.not for me
this wing stop gives the franchise a very bad look .
i'm so disappointed because i love wing stop .
this a casino not a restaurant.
walking in at 8am to a smoke permeated venue with 500 seats.
the food counter is like a stadium counter.
had to walk out just to get clean air and never looked at food.
lights literally "spotlight" you at your seat.
feels like what they show police interrogations as in the movies.
the poor re-design wrecks what used to be a good experience.
it was so not worth the price i will never go there again.
i went there for an inspection and an oil change.
despite all of this, they refused to give me a refund.
went in opening day, typical buffet.
walked out when i saw the price was $15.99 per person.
way to much for stuff i've seen at other buffets for around $9.00.
like the very few, i swear they scammed my cousin and i on price.
susan did an okay job.
not sure about the other ladies working there.
never going back, sorry.
first off his wife isn't polite.
also we were told by their assistant it would be $380 fee.
specially since i was a new client and referred.
i found a coupon with 30% discount.
i will be going back to my original tax guy who charges $250.
guy would not be famous if this was his flagship.
my second choice was a dry and tasteless turkey sandwich.
how can you mess that up too?
the only thing they got right was a cheery waitress and cold beer.
so we won't be going back.
however, it wasn't my greatest experience.
don't think i would go back.
dinner outside was the worst experience.
we had to have dinner in the dark because the lights kept shutting off.
the waiter that we had was very rude and i didn't receive my meal.
i had to cancel it because they forgot i ordered food.
i just spent an evening with food poisining.
i had the soup/salad/cornbread combo.
soup was carrot lime.
salad was edamame.
i'm a musician and this was my pre-show meal.
i thought i was doing something good for myself.
turns out something in the ingredients was bad or dirty.
i had to bow out of the show.
just thought if let everyone know.
might not be so "fresh" at fresh.
the quality of service at this spg property seems to be sliding.
a real amazing response for "just deal with it".
so many other things - too many to mention.
i have sent email message about the problem.
i called 644-4444, left a message to call me and a girl did call.
that was 10 days ago and still not fixed.
what is up???
do you not need the sales??
oh my gosh!
i ordered a sourdough chicken avacado sandwich with no mayo and no tomato.
i get home and it is smothered in mayo and tomato.
i hate mayo.
i called them and they put me on a list for 2 free entrees.
gimmie a break....
hire someone competent to work the kitchen.
i will not be going back!
i have come to this store several times now.
it's the same thing every time i go there.
they either need to be trained properly or fired.
either way, i am never going into this store again.
there are much friendlier stores in town that sell the same products.
stir crazy is crazy slow!
we waited for 45 min for entrees that are burned / tasteless.
the store wasn't even half full!!
will never go again!
the service was horrid.
the sushi was stale and cold.
they need new staff.
won't be going back again.
i went this morning the food was good, but !!!!
the service was terrible!!!!!!!!
we waiting for the bill like half hours !!!!
i would give this place 0 stars if possible.
the owner, margarita could not have conducted herself in a worse way.
please never go support someone like this!!!
i grew up eating harry's and it was always good.
now with the new management it is absolute crap.
the food is greasy and never cooked properly.
you ask for well done fries and they are complete mush.
they are running this restaurant into the ground.
it's what harry's used to be
took my car in for service at berge and had a horrible experience.
not including the aggravation of dealing with their poor customer service.
they have always provided awesome service.
this place is horrible!
all staff seem to be on drugs and sooooo rude!
services are horrible.
can't believe it
you definitely don't get what you pay for here.
prices are ridiculous for tasteless small meat.
those are the vibes we got.
we came here for my sister's 21st birthday dinner and our experience was horrible...
charged $50 for a simple "look and see" physical exam.
no temperature, pulse, respirate rate were measured.
left vet in 15 minutes and were charged $80 in total.
i own a small truck and run nationwide.
i use firestones stores across the country for my tire service needs.
firestone tires are great and i get professional service at their stores.
that said, this store is the worst firestone store i've ever been to.
i wouldn't trust them ever again to work on my vehicle.
another fail for this stay at westgate.
posted everywhere of its times then my family and i get down there.
.."sorry...well be back in 2 days."
worst service ever!!
i have been to other apple stores and have never encountered service like this.
employees terribly rude and unhelpful and made me late for show.
the show was good if you can avoid the terrible service issues.
the food did not remember italian or any or ethnicity.
does the person who made this even know how to cook?
don't let me get started on my husbands panini which was equally as bad.
don't you take pride in serving good food?
advertised as gelato - it is not.
it's more like sorbet but at gelato prices!
the girl who helped us was rude and obviously didn't want to be there.
the donuts were dry and hard, not even edible.
we ended up throwing them away.
what a waste of money :(
i'm never staying here again.
this hotel is pretty sad.
the gym is terrible the pool is ehh.
just not what i expected.
in a weekend you'll spend about 200 taxi fares.
you could take the shuttle but then you're on their schedule.
not worth more than 40 a night
lack of customer service..
just horrible go to another store
take a dump on my sammich and call me suzy....
greasy salads with little to no meat and a surplus of iceberg lettuce ect.
hm. if u just want something to eat.
fare place to go.
the absolute worst service.
we were told 45 min for our order.
worse customer service!!!
they all seem like they feel dreadful to be working there.
coming to shop here makes you feel a huge ball of negative energy.
i'm never coming back again to shop.
the front desk staff are nasty, rude people!
they don't want to help, they make you feel like you are an inconvenience!!!!
as if we enjoyed going in!
otherwise we, wouldn't go in!
i will not be going back there, nor would i send people there anymore!!!
this place either needs to close or the front desk staff need to change!!!!
make sure you have a half hour to spare before you enter a line.
i personally waited forever and had to drive straight through without ordering a drink.
this is not was a drive thru is for.
first, there were no cars available for customers.
the car was scratched and dented.
so, to make a long story short...
i will never rent here again!!!!
i wish i could give these thieves -20 stars.
they are just a big scam.
watch ut please it could happen to you too.
just stay away from it to save your money!!
either way, super gross.
i couldnt finish the meal, my sons boneless wings were dry as can be.
wont be back!
just stopped there for a breakfast taco.
this is not good to have people walking and working on the food counter.
plus some plaster and debris was falling.
all while the clerk is serving customers.
i wonder what goes on in the back ?
probably would not go back.
bottom-line....bought from their website an"archival" gucci bag and discovered upon receiving it's fake!
my heart dropped when i received my order.
eh. if you can't eat meat or cheese don't bother.
only 1 vegetarian option on the menu.
greek salad has sardine dressing.
it's not vegetarian!
i just wish there was a little more variety on the menu.
it's very much a cheesy, meaty, greasy mess.
if you're lactose intolerant i wouldn't suggest either.
they lost a whole table because i couldn't eat anything on the menu.
overall very disappointed....and i love guy!
the food was decent but the service was very very slow.
it took a long time for the food to arrive.
definitively not the go place when in a rush!
we actually left hungry which is disappointing.
then i find a long piece of curly black hair on my wrapper.
this place is out of business.
those of you with unused 2014 city tin coasters are out of luck.
even though this place is cheap, you still don't get what you pay for.
what a terrible location for this franchise.
the rest of this bowl was just tofu and soup.
the kimchi here tastes too sour because it's been kept for too long.
the other two banchan were not very memorable and we did not want refills.
not happy with how the manager handlers the situation.
if food is made to order then why were my fries cold, both times.
yes i sent them back.
a nice amount of fries, but don't care for them.
should have stuck w slim pickins but slim is the key word.
i won't be back, sorry slim!
waited 15 minutes for someone to take our drink order.
20 minutes later drinks still didn't come.
the place wasn't even that busy.
tasteless and bland.
the "green onion pancakes" were greasy and had no trace of onion.
next time, there won't be a next time.
told us 2 bring back & they would fill in with glue!
did not go back.
absolutely done with them, their customer service is the worst.
i will never return or recommend this place
well someone needs to do their job.
thanks again for starting my day off wrong starbucks!!!!!!!
don't do it unless you are in it for the crab legs.
everything tasted like dorm cafeteria food.
turkey was lifeless.
salad bar was equivalent with the sizzler.
nothing tasted as it should.
good variety but very little is edible.
even the desserts looked good but tasted like nothing (how do you birch dessert??!!).
stale and tired and not with $45/person.
got citrus slaw fish tacos.
one small one inch piece of fish inside.
not the first time.
ordered burritos serious lack of chicken.
i would give this company a zero star if i could.
it's false advertising!!!!
please do not buy this groupon!!!
i definitely recommend this place for any outing.
owner locked the parking lot.
came in at 4:30 on a sunday for a simple alignment and tire rotation.
service hours posted are until 6:00pm.
as i leave i see 3 employees just standing around talking watching me leave.
nice one guys.
they served us all beer at the bar without checking our id's.
hostile staff kept an eye on us for the rest of our visit.
guess i was not "lucki"
unfortunately, due to lack of " checking " account..
and no wish to open one..
i will not be able to experience this gym ..
a credit card or cash is not an option..
stopped by for some food and a cold drink.
waited at the bar for 10 minutes while staff walked around 'looking busy'.
no one looked at me or asked if i wanted anything.
upper management must wonder why this location is underperforming compared to other native locations.
btw i left after 10 minutes.
this place has dirty tables, dirty windows, and absolutely filthy washrooms.
need i say more.
massage therapists are awesome but front desk is terrible.
sucks but it is what it is.
sad that i will have to find a new therapist .
do not ask these people for help!
so find somewhere else to shop!
save yourself time, aggravating, and money!!
this store has idiots working for them.
have been avoiding this place for the last year, due to repeated bad experiences.
thought we'd give them another chance, and see if things have improved.
unfortunately both me and my wife got food poisoning.
the mall that time forgotcame by here last sunday during the heatwave.
several stores didn't have ac and were blisteringly hot.
eb games was like an oven.
many of the storefronts have been abandonedwashrooms are scary and unkept.
it was really depressing here...
i worked there in 1975.
clean, busy and vibrant.
fast forward 40 years.
dilapidated, ugly, empty, smelly dump.
why anyone would go there is beyond comprehension.
just call for the bulldozers and do the area a favor.
terrible margarita, even worse service, had to leave after waiting an hour for queso.
can't review the food because it never came.
never in my life have i had such a terrible experience at a restaurant.
i am livid!!!!
the food here is really good but its expensive and portions are small.
the first time i picked up from the store and everything was good.
i had to dispute the charge with my credit card company as fraud.
i also give maryann mangan lourenco from farmers insurance at 7501 w.
lake mead blvd 89128 a one, because a zero is not an option.
unfortunately at no fault of our own, we had a claim.
we were misinformed by this unlicensed person directly from maryann's office.
this misinformation delayed our claim and cost us thousands of dollars.
feel free to contact me(702)204-7177
this is probably the worst mexican restaurant that i have ever eaten.
i saw this location so i wanted to try it.
i ordered a chicken burrito with rice and beans on the side.
the burrito along with the side were nasty.
the chicken was really salty.
the beans and rice tasted like they put a tub of salt.
i couldn't eat it so i threw it away.
next time, i will just starve to death.
be prepared to pay out of pocket, in addition to your co-pay.
i guess they just don't make enough pounding your insurance along with the co-pays?????
well, apparently the pa office is hurting to get every dollar possible!
this place is now horrible since the renovations.
the food was barely edible.
i have never had such poorly prepared sushi rice.
it tasted like uncle ben's with too much water.
i have never been kicked out of a place before.
they are too cheap to hire a bus boy.
we tried flagging her down to get some chinese mustard.
we waited forever to get our bill.
will never go here again.
while the staff were nice the wait was ridiculous.
it's close to the strip so it's mostly out of towners.
avoid it if possible unless you want to be there half a day.
walked in on a sunday morning.
place was pretty busy but several tables were open.
we sat there for about 15 minutes.
nobody approached us.
lots of staff shooting the breeze with regulars, nobody approached us.
mind you, this is not a big place.
unless you're a regular don't wast your time.
food is either tasteless or too greasy.
horrible service all around.
stick with the original location.
like most expansions the customer service and quality is severely lacking in this location.
they cancelled an order or left out an item 3 times!
i don't understand the need to lie.
don't blame a 3rd party delivery service when you don't even update your website.
stay away from their express locations and stick with the main location.
the lady here is a waste....i don't know why  she is sitting over there!!
please don't go here and waste your time!!!!
i don't know why i keep going back here...
convenience i guess.
this place is the worst though.
what's up with that?
ugh, next time i'm going to costco!!!
i used to buy stuff at this booster juice all the time.
but like many places i frequented, it's under new management now.
i got the matcha monson once & the taste was just awful.
i won't come back here again unless the owners change again.
really not good pho.
it's overpriced and the broth has way too much star anise.
it's really a counter service place so prices should be much lower.
only good thing is it's near sprouts haha.
go to pho thanh instead.
fortunately there was no permanent injury.
but aldi and their insurance company refused to pay me for my medical expenses.

three girls at customer service but only two at the register.
the shirt wasn't worth waiting anymore.
my daughter attended this dojo for a couple of months (little ninjas).

disrespectful, no mannerisms, horrible business owner, rude to my child.
we never showed up again.

the food was horrible, they couldn't make a simple chicken quesadilla.
we had a party of 6, and not a single person liked their food.
we paid $60 and only took two bites.
their silverware was dirty, there was a bug in one of the drinks.
never, ever coming back.
i suggest you don't waste your time either.
i couldn't leave the parking lot without posting this !!!
if i could give this bank 0 star i would!!!
the worst bank to treat business owners!!!
if you're a business owner don't come to this place.

should get rid of that line if not gonna be priority !!!
change management and has gone down hill.
it's slow, portions are smaller and the staff is terrible.
they also raises the prices.
also tables and condiments areas not clean and well maintained.
what the heck happened to this mall?!?!
the place looks like it was nuked, since there's nothing there anymore.
there's also some shady people that go here.
luckily they tore it down and made a nice strip mall.
i'm actually baffled at how this place has changed.
we had to wait 35 minutes for a table.
then it took 40 minutes to get our food.
no apologies, nothing.
that was for our $41 bill for 2 people.
i'll never come back again.
screw this place and screw scottsdale!!

the food is bland and tasteless...
we walked across to panda express!!

i would select another toyota dealer if you have to use one!
we took a taxi from the strip and arrived.
the waiter said we can sit anywhere.
not only us, but others said the same.

atmosphere is bland.

rudest service ever!!!

this place is a joke.
the dude wasn't too excited to ring me out either.
while we ate our chips, pickles and drank our half spilt dr pepper.
really nice right?
i don't have time to argue with people over something so stupid!
this place is absolutely horrible!
i will order pizza for my employees and never again eat here!
i highly recommend you skip jimmy johns!
very expensive and very rude..
wouldn't recommend them to anyone!
i can understand a profit but charging someone over 188% profit is crazy..
absolutely terrible service from the bar staff.
they all looked lost like it was their first day.
took over 30 mins for 2 orders of wings.
also, my second blue moon was magically $0.25 more expensive than my first one...
will never come back.
horrible experience with them.
overall a terrible experience and also way too overpriced compared to their competitors.
food was terrible!
please do not waste you time or money.
went there for lunch and was not impressed.
considering the price, it is a huge disappointment.
she would only offer me a gift card.
never a "i'm sorry"...nothing.
i will never shop here or any walmart again for meat!!!!!
it was gross!!!!!
service absolutely horrible.
after we finally ordered waitress never came back to the table.
not a place i will return to.
to the person who thinks my review was dumb.
you must work for them or be related to someone who works there.
abd yes smiths, ir albertsons would gladly give me a missing item.
they like to keep their loyal customers happy.
the mistake is theirs and the dishonesty is theirs.
stick thus in your pipe and smoke it.
tried many times to set up tattoo with cleen rock, never worked out.
too busy to set up appointment.
no when helped us after 10 minutes we gave up.
banchans are the best part of korean dining!
unfortunately, it's very limited here.
taste wise, the bbq was fine but pricier than most places.
i didn't even enjoy my sundubu.
it was like eating tofu in flavored water.
servers are nice but very slow and forgetful.
horrible customer service and it started from day 1.
horrible to go service.
and we're not talking peak hours here.
would not recommend.
the door was locked at.
11:30 am so i called their number .
i went to birks who sold me the pen i wanted .
birks doesn't carry mb watches so not sure where to buy one .
service was horrific.
we couldn't get napkins without begging.
the chips are really thin.
the house salsa was way too lemony.
i am amazed that this is a successful restaurant.
i'm from texas and am tough judge of texmex.
the charro beans were the best i've had in charlotte.
place order to find out we would be substituting items because they ran out.
items were not brought out all at once leaving part of the meal cold.
we will not be returning for a meal.
haven't had a problem with picking up pies.
most racist place i've been to my whole almost 40 years on this planet.
i sat down for approximately 25 mins.
and no one came to take our order.
i asked to speak to a manager that never came.
disgusting and ignorant behavior.
don't stay here if you love your pet!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
i got my apple juice in a 300 ml plastic bottle and no cup.
eggspectation's caffe latte: half a cup of coffee for the full price...
(see my photo published)
first not really good for kids, no boaster sits or high chair.
this was my second time coming and it will be my last.
if he was frustrated, fine...
but act like an adult.
go somewhere else with respectable people.
would never give my money.
delivery guy was awesome even though he looked like he should be retired.
i asked to speak to the manager and he said that was him.
terrible customer service.
i will never order from here again.
this store is incredibly messy.
has bad smell.
employees horribly rude.
books priced at 12.99.
electronics just thrown on top of each other.
other goodwill's have a much better shopping experience.
a new battery costs about $150.
at auto zone, my battery ready full voltage and a 100% charge.
no issue whatsoever!
moon township honda is corrupt!
managers are horrible!
tried to book a party and was treated very badly.
they would rather leave their gold room empty then to let customers utilize it.
my suggestion for big parties is to either go to heb box or kellys.
much nicer- friendlier and not as snotty!
won't be back anytime soon
yelp usually never fails me.
tonight it totally did.
service was slow.
salsa was bad.
ordered chicken fajitas for 2 and it wasn't worth one and it was $26!!!
the chicken had lots of gristle.
4 x more veggies than chicken.
margarita was small and totally not worth $11.
there will not be a 2nd chance.
review is based on card selection.
they only carry used casino cards.
it depends on which hairdresser you choose.
i have been to this place many times for the past a few years.
however, there is a korean speaking woman hairdresser pissed me off today.
my hair looks terrible after her cut and she is very rude.
i'd recommend avoiding her if you can.
this place is horrible.
it was listed in top 10 but can't see any reason why.
we were here for sunday champagne brunch.
almost everything on the line was either rock hard or cold.
bread was day old, salad dressing was good but salad was over dressed.
which is pretty average at most and bit pricey.
look out for places with longer opening times and serious quality coffee.
at least in this category there is no shortage....
came with my sister inlaws for a girls date.
they did our nails one at a time so it took forever.
three different people worked on my nails.
not even a week has passed and they start falling off!
$60 for nails that didn't last a week, waste of money!!
we had a security system need.
after he ran the credit, he set us up with a tech evaluation appointment.
i've left two more messages since for them, no response.
i'm disappointed with the lack of communication and customer service at skytec security.
i regret this decision to trust a pushy pushy salesman like justin.
this email was sent to you in error.
we sincerely apologize for this error and any confusion this email may have caused.
guess they don't want my money.
very rude manager.
watched them turn away 6 customers at 11:50pm.
do not waste your time or money
she looked confused and in disbelief at what she was seeing.
children do not belong in a hot tub to begin with.
it seems to be an ongoing problem.
i won't be back.
i was there last friday evening with a friend.
no one acknowledged us after we were seated for 10 minutes.
then water was delivered with the menu.
waited another 10 minutes to order.
waited another 10 minutes.
waiter came and told us he had misplaced our order.
food came out cold.
not very happy.
should have been offered our meal without charge.
not sure if i will go back.
this place has a lot of hype but we didn't care for the food.
location permanently closed.
very poor customer service!
oh and i wasn't given a receipt!
wow i am not surprised they have this kind of rating.
took them only one month to get our drier fixed.
worst customer service ever!!!
tried to call a couple of times to see what's going on.
i have been told countless times that i will get a call back.
not once did i get it.
i was kinda stuck with them because my home warranty company sent them.
do not use this company!!!!
returned today to replace a poor meal from the fall.
previously the drive thru screwed up the order.
fried were cold and burgers under cooked with green tomatoes.
our previous concerns were addressed with a replacement whenever we could get back.
today was the day.
lesson learned .
based on our experience today.
our food was served on soiled dishes.
the bagel was rather odd shape and ugly.
my wife's carrot cake muffin was very dry.
panera bread has been subject to inconsistency.
this branch is normally one of the better ones but not today.
our dishes at home do not have dark stains.
other restaurants do not have this problem.
waitress said fries didn't come with our meals so we ordered extras.
turns out every meal came with fries.
it was a huge mess.
will not be back
the cook was an obnoxious, loud, rude jerk who treated people like garbage.
on top of that his food was awful.
i do not in any way recomend this facility, what a joke.
she should have come to talk to us and apologize.
dropped my computer off to the repairs dept.
to replace my liquid cooling system.
it would be nice to get an update, guys.
$35 for my wife and i.
it took a very long time to get our food.
lots of people behind the counter doing nothing.
the sliced brisket taste like it was cooked in the oven, not a smoker.
it was about 50% fat.
my wife had a stuffed potato with pork which was cold as well.
don't do it!
you'll regret it!!
paid $200 for high lights and walked out with fried hair!!
do not come here ladies!
this place gives you a long wait time!
they are slow and overprice on everything.
i didn't even get a discount when i was supposed to!
i am always nice to workers but the man here is beyond rude.
i would definitely not recommend this place to anyone!!
go anywhere else!
food was overpriced and not that great.
slow service wouldn't even refill my drink.
interior is dingy and the tables were sticky i would not recommend this place.
the tacos are not good.
tortillas were probably out for awhile.
the venetian used to be my favorite hotel up until today.
there was not enough amenities for the price of the room.
i highly recommend other hotels on the strip for the same price.
i came here for my 29th birthday and i was very disappointed.
i had their chicken shwarama plate delivered via uber eats.
the portions aren't the greatest, and the quality of the food wasn't the best.
it's like they didn't trim the fat off the meat.
i was a bit disappointed.
never ordering again
nice way to run a business i will not be back
bought an open box tv that didn't work.
will stick with amazon from now on.
worst meal ever.
thought this was a popular family place?
so not worth it.
the bacon was cold and not tasty.
the hash browns were luke warm not crispy and the service was terribly!
definitely not going back.
i'd hate to see what it is like during their busy time, eeeekkkkk!!!!!
unpredictable service .my order back in february 2016, was filled without an issue.
on my order of july 2016, all i got was the run around.
it is in stock and shipping today....
gps city customer service representatives could not have been more disinterested in assisting me.
been here for over 4 hours and still haven't seen a doctor.
they are always short staffed.
dont waste your time or your $.
i ended up here because barros shut down.
large 2 topping at barros is $13.
here it is $25.
wow, what disappointment, dirty place with sticky floors and tables.
i left the rest.
the corn bread was under cooked too.
horrible experience, however, everyone seemed very nice.
if i could give a negative 4 star review, i would.
seriously, haven't seen my car since 12.20.2015.
no clue where its at.
i don't understand how this company is allowed to operate.
i am so stressed out and considering filing a claim.
i was extremely disappointed.
their chilequiles were basically tortilla chips sprinkled with queso fresco...and cost over $20.
what a sad disappointment.
the most horrible staff with absolutely zero people skills and no customer service desire.
what hurts is that i am a five star member!
for whatever that's worth.
i would give them "zero" if i could.
rude and unprofessional ...
no more renting from hertz....
the apartment have lot of roaches, frogs, lizards and insects.
no action taken from the management even after several complaints.
treats tenants very badly.
hotel searchers beware!!!
our server seemed to be upset with us from the moment we sat down.
i certainly hope their dinner service is better.
the atmosphere mirrors an east coast jewish deli.
however, unlike jewish delis,this establishment doe moreovs not cook their own brisket.
that said, i will no longer frequent this establishment.
pre cooked kawalski deli products does not make a valid jewish deli!!
shame on you bagel cafe!!
completely disappointed with the service team at percision fleet services and tim.
he was very rude and inconsiderate to me on the phone.
if i could put a negative score i would!
so i wasted my pay for this place.
time to find a new eye doctor!
how is it that gas stations get away with charging to use a card.
no other business does that...
it's 2016, deal with the 1.4% charge and move on.
i don't go to stations that do this and i won't come back here...
absolutely the worst service i've ever experienced in my life.
food was cold by the time it arrived.
this place used to be good too.
were running behind" horrible experience.
cynthya at ez rent a car was our agent.
she was very rude and condescending.
she pushed the insurance on us when we didn't want it.
we were covered.
i was then charged  $399 on my debit which i was not aware of.
ok ill give them that one but $399.89 hold on a $76 rental?!!!
i over drafted my account.
i would give them zero stars if i could.
this was my second incident with allegiants terrible logistics and customer service.
staff were very friendly and the big cheese they served us was really good.
but we had to waited long time for our pastas...
when we finally received our food, we were all dissapointed.
only thing that was good was lobster ravioli.
i am not recommending this restaurant to anyone.
they skimped on the lentils on the lentil soup...
very disappointed, i highly recommend going elsewhere.
*do not go to this place!
horrible experience, much more expensive than others.
will try to trick you any way they can!
i ended up spend $31.46 with 9 boxes(2x-large, 3 large, 4 medium).
the guy counted the boxes right but put 10 on my bill.
my wife and i looked forward to eating here for weeks.
we decided to get one of our favorites tonight, bbq pork ribs.
let me say...
neither one of us would recommend this place.
terrible experience with this so called "company".
owner is a lunatic.
owner will give you all kinds of excuses.
i wish someone had warned us.
biggest waste of time.
i would give zero stars if i could.
this company has been giving me the run around for over a week!!!!!
what kind of company are you running?
absolutely doesn't seem to care about their properties or renters.
this company is a complete and utter disappointment.
the wait makes the food not even worth it.
we had bryan as our sales man.
he did a great job showing us the cars and explaining  everything about them.
we didn't appreciate the way he spoke to us and treated us.
he made berge mazda lose the business.
good food, consistently horrible service.
for the third time being ignored by waitstaff, our patience is exhausted.
reheated it for dinner, took a bite and crunch.
i wish i were joking but literally found a rock inside (or charcoal maybe???).
nearly broke my tooth.
that's very disgusting and probably very unsafe.
10/10 would not come here again.
this vet is horrible!
used to be great but not anymore!!
i highly recommend going somewhere else.
they are negligent and don't even deserve 1 star.
they dont give a crap about your personal property either.
unquestionably the biggest yelp let down ever!
i had a pepperoni pizza and it was just plain flavorless.
the pepperoni and sauce was the delicious flavor of a good old water.
i've never been so disappointed in a well reviewed yelp establishment ever!
let's hope this is the first and last time!
(you'd be much better served by cibo, pizza a metro or spinatos ...
all within the vicinity)
do not use this company.
$2000 damage on my vehicle.
the claims department decided not to pay.
i had shipped another vehicle through them previously and there were no problems then.
zero stars if possible!
worst experience possible and i did not even visit the restaurant.
restaurant is open until 11:00pm.
called to make a reservation for 8:30pm and i'm told that it's too late.
maybe he should choose a different profession.
and carman at the front desk is not very friendly.
this place use to be nice   will never have relatives stay here again.
we walked in and it seemed nice.
however the waitress was probably the most rude person i have ever encountered.
i will never go here again.
the customer service is absolutely terrible.
they won't offer you any service to take your bags up.
this is literally the last you should consider.
poor customer service always has a line going out the door.
it was as if they didn't add salt to anything.
the dough had wood fired marks but no wood fired taste.
it also just didn't taste.
there was no sense of yeast.
the mushrooms and pepperoni also were bland.
i was very disappointed.
i haven't been to this place for over a year.
i can't and won't go back there.
this was probably 8 months ago.
huge waste of money and time.
i should have checked yelp before i came here.
if i could give this place negative stars, i would.
$65 later, i had to go home and detail the car myself.
especially if you have pets.
i love texas roadhouse...
unfortunately this location desperately needs to get with the program.
since opening, i've probably visited 6 or 7 times.
the issues are poor customer service, wrong orders, and over cooked meat.
we set up an appointment for 445 for new born photos.
the employee who was supposed to take our picture saw us and came back.
she explained they closed at 5, and all appointments are only 15 minutes long.
then she back tracked and said new borns always get an hour.
new born photos are time sensitive, this was really frustrating.
thanks for hooking it up with lots of "cold" bacon.
overall sanwhich is cold..
cheese isn't even melted.
and it was slow in there....
i usually love einstein's..
but this ...
wa wa waa
today i was disconnected twice, 15 minutes in to each call.
i'm not sure if they are using an archaic system or what.
there's got to be a better option!
she tried to half threateneland scare my friend into buying it.
she cared more about her personal preference than about our experience.
would not go back nor would i recommend it to anyone.
phillips law group suck.too bad zero stars is not available.
they took my case to court.
i gave them a perfect case and they blew it.
went here with high expectations since it's a high price restaurant but left disappointed.
disappointed and will not go back.
who's bright idea to redesign the store without a break in the aisles?
only bus boy was attentive with our drinks.
had to ask for waiter on several occasions but got ignored.
bus boy took our orders.
very disappointed with the service.
never coming back if they paid me.
we are two days from closing and probably won't.
their communication method is radio silence.
a first time home buyer army vet with a va loan.
over 25 calls placed to the office.
not one returned call.
i just read golfsmith is in bankruptcy.
quit shopping there several years ago because as you may or may not realize.
we have choices in this country.
i recommend tasty asian kitchen.
they have called me twice the day of to try to get her in.
people have jobs, i cannot just drop what i am doing and run there.
who is in charge of this place??
h&m, zara, and costa blanca for $20?
you can get brand new items from these stores for less.
the next day, maintenance was at our door first thing to fix the problem.
no locals allowed.
well maybe the vip.
this is not who we want in phoenix.
this is not what we've been fighting for.
she said hi how are you?
i said good thanks how are you?
she didn't respond just looked at me with an uncomfortable smerk.
i got my make up done and loved it.
beware if you go for make up!
totally the worst location to go to.
the weight was ridiculously long and the staff was not all that friendly.
a suggestion for all..
he apologized for the false information and that they could trace the call.
i asked what the benefit for me for you to trace the call?
so twice they wasted my time and couldn't help me.
i would not recommend staying at this hotel!!!!
i stayed here on friday sept 29, for 1 night.
i was forced to contact environmental health.
they went out and discovered there were bed bugs in room 223.
i contacted the hotel again and spoke to "mr chris".
please do not stay here.
they are nasty and very rude!!!!
the demo stops then i hear silence & someone hangs up wtf
plus it cost $13.00 to split a meal.
worst food ever.
i paid $130 per ticket for section 206 row x seats 3 and 4.
i personally will never attend another show where i cannot see the performers face.
this venue is too large for a non-screening performance.
terrible company will never ever use again.
seriously the worst service i have ever got in my life .
you think they brought change ?
3 timesssss i told them .
horrible cold pizza too i will never eat with pizza hut ever again .
i asked for a cappuccino and the milk was sour.
dude thought he should argue with me about it so i got a refund.
this company does not follow-through with reservations.
no showed on us.
even though we got email confirmations for the pick up.
thank god for uber!!!
even at 5am last minute, they were available and dependable
well...another loser restaurant on the west side.
this is absolutely the poorest excuse for a restaurant.
slow, unprofessional service.
greasy, soggy fried appetizers.
dirty, dingy atmostphere.
who uses canned green beans in a restaurant?
we will not return ever...........
no respect towards other military personnel.
they also don't follow their own rules with no hats sandals etc...
trashy as fuck.
terrible service, employees have no idea what they are doing.
i had such a bad experience that i will be cancelling my tmobile service
we planned our day around it and arrived right on time.
my husband asked for a table.
we declined, of course, but we were both just aghast.
the young guy at the front door was very pleasant and helpful.
bartenders were rude and continuously bad mouthed us right in front of our faces.
we even had a former salt cellar employee with us.
we will not return.
too bad because the food was excellent as always.
this was the worst meal i have had in a while.
the bread was soggy and the tomatoes tasted old.
i had the chicken quesadilla and it was very dry.
the salsa and guacamole were less than fresh.
it was inedible.
this place was terrible.
i will never go back.
everytime i come here it's a bad experience.
cashiers are slow and look like hey don't care about their jobs.
peopleon the floor don't know much either.
3.15.17whoever manages this walmart needs to train their people better!
always a bad experience here.
people are way too slow.
the worst mac n cheese ever!!
the ribs were dry & miserable!
the burger had a bitter taste to it!!
never going back to this franchise!!
waitress was really nice.
be prepared for a 45 minute wait for sub standard food!!
what a joke.
all i have to say is bad service!
the restaurant was nowhere near full capacity as there were tables still open.
this is my 1st bad review and comment ever.
i am a pretty laid-back guy but come on!
we spent the night waiting for them.
don't ever use this company, it is a scam.
today it was it!
thinking of insuring the rental vehicle through your credit card or personal insurance?
they will come up with lame bull**** reason and say your card/insurance doesn't qualify.
they go on to forcing you to purchase their insurance at absurd rates.
i highly suggest sticking with enterprise or hertz.
nope, the portions were small and the food was borderline disgusting.
this place is crap, extremely overpriced.
the food is garbage.
the wait and service were just as bad.
sorry, guy, try again.
it's saturday morning and you only have one person working ?
this line is terrible ...
not worth waiting ...
our time here felt like it was an inconvenience.
our waitress was disinterested and inattentive.
we will never return.
shame on joes for valet only parking.
how is this even legal!?
i guess they would rather have their precious valet parking than safety!
i never thought someone could make the beatles boring-but cirque did!
at best this resembles a very good high school dance production of the beatles.
this show benefits from enormous and unwarranted hype only because it is the beatles.
this is not a good dairy queen.
almost every time i've tried to go, i get the worst customer service.
the employees are all very rude and uncaring of their job.
every other time, i'm greeted with rudeness from a bunch of high schoolers.
i will not be coming back.
i would rather give 0 stars!
i wouldn't eat it for free or even if you paid me!
my first time, and definitely my last at this place!
no excuse for this!
today was not good...scheduled an appointment in person with the receptionist...or so i thought.
i schedule appts for a reason.
that would be a no .
missing the hand washing step completely.
he shrugged and asked if i wanted a new one.
i said yes of course.
i prefer my ice cream without the attitude and germs.
this is unbelievable!
this is outrageous.
we used riteway of calgary to move to bc.
moving is stressful enough without expensive surprises.
worst take out food ever.
i heard some good reviews about this asian infused place.
so i decided to order some spicy thai wings, pad thai, and mango chicken.
took it home to my family; unfortunately, we were disappointed in the food.
for the price i paid for this food.
i should have taken it back and ask for a refund.
this business, has no license and no insurance.
and you will be wishing you never called.
save your money.
this place reuses the same food day after day.
the staff are underpaid and absolutely miserable working here.
roflmbo i am not fooled one bit.
which is a no no big time.
then lashing out when someone who's been in the dump gives an honest review.
the items will be cheaper and cleaner.
copy of response load into photos.
i've had their pizza and it's ok but spaghetti was a fail.
they jist took over in my neighborhood.
worse company by far
we bought some small spinach pastries to go.
they were pre-wrapped, without date or indications of any kind.
very simple, glaring error.
we had eaten there earlier in the night, and the eat-in food was ok.
fwiw, the restaurant on yonge and dundas is better.
it was my favorite place.
i went there 4 times in last 8 years .
it getting worse every time i go .
now it's to pricey for no food as i expected.
the buffet is really poor.
i'm never gonna be there anymore
the only good thing about this place is the ac.
small, dry, one note tacos.
i just wanted delicious tacos!
why are these $2.50?
why was this phoenix magazine's readers choice best tacos in 2016?
was there a change in ownership?
i'm probably more annoyed than i should be...
other choice is going downtown.
do not order the dumpling  with soup.
they have no idea on keeping it with the soup.
i was foolish to expect quality food from here.
price was too much.
i would travel 45 minutes go to there instead of this dump.
talk about dog crap service.
if you don't like your job then quit.
bartenders at the saloon are clueless and don't do their job.
reason why i'm a local and stick to the gv area.
just here waiting for a friend.
surprised this place hasn't closed its doors!
i've purchased earplugs here before with no issue but lost them.
you're better off buying online.
onions onions onions.
ordered a lengua burrito and it was filled with onions.
also ordered shredded beef nachos and there was no meat only onions .
the restaurant has lost its touch.
the food is not good anymore.
there are so many other options now so we won't be returning.
extremely rude gentlemen.
went in and asked for an oil change.
this was my first time coming to good year.
my family has worked for good year for a long time.
i didn't deserve that kind of service.
bad choice and never again.
the last time i ordered, i paid for an extra container of salad dressing.
thanks for the undressed salad, guys!
the time before that, they forgot the 2 liter i ordered and paid for.
looks like i'll be forgetting to order from this location.
extremely annoying and starting to waste my money.
buy a burrito somewhere else - complete garbage.
sour cream and guac???
ya feel me??
this review is centered specifically on fatburger's outside "yard long" alcoholic beverages.
dont waste your money, there is next to no alcohol in them.
these guys are crooks seriously.
police need to investigate!!!
dont buy a car from here and dont trust these crooks.
worst mistake of my life was trusting these guys.
never have they answered my phonecalls or returned my calls.
failed to send out prescriptions multiple times.
staff is rude and lacks empathy.
doctor is a joke.
this place is a scam.
needless to say we paid 16 bucks for some rice.
not happy at all.
our total order was over 40 bucks and was not worth the hefty price.
this place is a copy cat of what they offer next door.
from signage to specialty drinks to crepes.
now they even sell breakfast and meals.
you give that a thought.
how good/fresh are these drinks/food for such a low price.
the taste is not the same.
if you support plagiarism and fake cheap drinks then go ahead.
what you give is what you get.
my experience was disgusting.
smelled like rotten food too.
don't choose the option for them to fill up the car for you either!
will not be back to any of your locations!!!!
looked up pizza by the slice on yelp.
this place came up.
it's not really pizza by the slice.
you have to buy a $6 slice/drink combo.
staff's attitude is indifferent at best.
slice came with a fortune cookie which is weird.
got carded at the front door like normal......
i won't be going back cause of this bartender.
worst experience i've ever had!
i have lived in several different states and never had such a poor experience.
i will never go back.
worst customer service that i've experienced in a long time.
dirk arthur has had some or all of his "cats" declawed.
...people should not spend money to see this show and promote animal abuse.
the receptionist was very rude when i asked her a question about a product.
it was too personal.
they charge a very high prices.
they told me only for roots would cost me about a $100!!!!
way too much..
not taking even an appointment there..!!!
this place sucks!!!!!
never going back.
i'll spend all my money next door at the best place ever....
fu blue 32!!!!!
worst starbucks i have ever been to..
they are unprofessional and very slow.
coffee is not consistent.
that is the short and sweet version of the stories i have
absolutely shocked by the rude customer service.
very condescending and not at all helpful over the phone.
truly a shame, since they appear to have a decent product.
the person i spoke to claimed to be the owner.
honestly a shockingly bad phone experience.
i would not even consider ordering from this florist.
both were super gross.
the crossaint was burnt and tasted like plastic.
this location is terrible, if i could give it 0 stars, i would.
gave our car away even though it was reserved.
how are these people still in business?
somebody, anybody please tell me.
i am not happy with the delivery service from rc willie.
i considered it and i went back and selected a 7 foot couch.
they said that it wouldn't fit.
they refused to attempt it again.
i called customer service and cancelled my whole complete order.
do not want anything to do with rc willie.
i would never recommend going to a business that treated customers like this!!
is there any way to put 0 stars ?!?
needless to say we got up and left.
and even with the new tile it still looks dirty.
i had left my dog there at 10 am!
theyre terrible take your dog elsewhere.
4 attendants moving 1 customer every 15-20 minutes each.
go to another company, everyone has a reservation and it's still pathetically slow.
i can't even begin to  describe the filth.
black mold in the ice maker?
the most horrific, gross, place i've ever had the misfortune of staying.
i give this place a one star overall.
the service is bad and the food/drinks are just ok.
beware and just to be safe keep a copy of your signed receipt.
the view is ok but the food is not good at all.
nothing appealing on the menu for me to want to try again.
won't be back.
much better just down the road
this place is a hole!
i will never go in again.
not to mention all the empty stores.
it was so creepy.
i left pretty quickly.
if i could give no stars, i would.
great drinks and dancing but terrible staff.
ruined the night.
at the bellagio???
my own drink?
how excalibur of them!
mgm taking over bellagio is like walmart taking over saks fifth avenue!
it's garbage spend a few extra dollars go to the wynn buffet!
luckily, the drink is pretty damn good.
scam artists, do not use this service!!
will be reporting to the bbb.
they lied from the start.
they charge a 750% increase on the parts and labor is extremely expensive.
and now the scorpions have arrived.
worst place i've ever lived!
more bugs then i've ever seen
they need to be better at counting how many pieces of chicken.
we ordered a 12 piece and only got 8.
worse customer service too.
they never answer the phone and their corporate never gets back to you either.
last time we are coming here.
no idea how this place has such high reviews.
service was friendly, that's about it.
the food was extremely slow, took 50 minutes to get our pasta.
when the pasta finally did arrive, it was watery and bland.
tasted like microwaved frozen dinner.
most disappointing pasta i've ever had.
fix your menus.
the one marked $5.50 in two separate places.
at this point i just walked away.
not a great selection and always messy.
i think here as opposed to other macys is overpriced.
the clearance rack isnt very clearancee.
the food is disgusting and the service is terrible.
the chicken nuggets were burnt and gross.
i went to this dentist in 2011.
she did work on my teeth and charged my insurance.
i also paid hundreds of dollars in deductible.
when i refused to pay her extortion she put it on my credit.
i am still fighting this.
she is shady and her work is terrible !!!!
do not waste your money on these rip offs!
this used to be one of our favorite places for lenten fish fry.
the burger was really good, bought t that is where the good stops.
lo and behold there were bones.
not one bone but three.
i didn't say anything because i didn't feel like arguing with the manager.
i'm just very disgusted that they don't check for bones.
you have just lost a customer.
i complained about the noise then got extremely rude stares from the staff.
garbage small over priced wings.
honestly i would of rather eat the grilled cheese we ordered for our son.
they sell beer to go which is nice but at 10.60 a six pack.
we will be skipping this place next time we are in the area......no good
expensive and food are not fresh...
beef tastes like ages old...
no idea why there is long line in front of the buffet.
really miss the boston maki maki, must better food with much better price!
we live very close and were extremely disappointed to hear this.
we were there last week and they had the special!!
wow what kind of false advertising is that?
if i could give them no stars i would.
i literally started to cry when i saw my boyfriends hair cut.
my boyfriend left extremely unsatisfied with the way the barber cut his hair.
save yourself the hassle and do not come here.
we waited 45 minutes for our food.
i asked if the management would give us a discount for the wait.
the wait staff was great but the management was sloppy and hands off.
*****the server here was so rude!!!!!
worst experience ever.
we just sat down lady!!!
let us look at the menu!!!
the food was crappy too.
overpriced food ** bad tasting** small portions**rude servers!!!!
stay away from the place!!!!
ordered an italian sausage sandwich and a caesar salad, to go.
it took 30 minutes.
we placed our order at 1:14pm and received it at 1:45pm.
it used to be great!!
the sandwich was so-so.
won't be back.
too bad, because their pizzas look great.
well she doesn't..
so i scheduled one with a different office that said they do.
i took this trip to grand canyon from las vegas.
it was a nightmare - never again
yes, they make "white pies" in new york, but only as a special order.
so it's may and i still don't have my full extention drawers installed.
if i could give these people no stars i would.
they are bunch of liars and  con artists.
do not trust these people!!!
i was on vacation in las vegas and i was craving sam woo food.
i was so wrong!
i mean, i'm glad i tried it so i know never to go back.
i would recommend going to a buffet to get chinese food instead..
it has the typical hotel beds and complimentary shampoos.
i was very angry at this.
when i am 21 , i am surely not coming here again.
which i'm not!
how is this criticism a conflict of interest?
liar and this is bad for your business.
we were supposed to be on a flight from rockford, il.
to orlando, fl.
it was supposed to depart at 9:39am.
never once in all this time did anyone even say sorry for the inconvenience.
i will never fly this airline again.
i don't understand why the ratings are so high for this place.
i'm spoiled coming from or where thai restaurants are plentiful and delicious.
i ordered the chicken pad thai, fried wontons, and a side of peanut sauce.
first off, their delivery boxes leaked all over the bag which was annoying.
second, the pad thai was orange.
i've never seen this before.
the only thing redeeming to me is their peanut sauce.
i felt like i was eating cafeteria food.
i will not be back.
doesn't even deserve the one star.
i don't generally give bad review's, but my experience here was inexcusable.
waited on table bread for 1 hour, but it never came.
restaurant wasn't busy at all, but our appetizers took 75 minutes to come out.
queen margarita, pizzeria libretto, etc..
i showed up for my appointment and no one was there.
i am not sure how this woman stays in business.
do not waste your time or money---even if it is a groupon.
i have eaten several times at this restaurant.
suddenly, the prices have increased!
on my most recent visit (8/15/2013) we were the only couple in the place.
my veal parmiegana  was burnt and salty.
being kind, the food was very average, but definately not worth the price.
sorry to see this restaurant change.
we had hoped we finally had a good italian restaurant in our neighborhood.
don't waste your time.
not really a great experience for first haircuts.
we went to celebrate our anniversary and were expecting quite a lot.
honestly wish there was a zero or half star rating.
quoted $118 for a small living room and sectional cleaning.
work looked horrible nothing was clean at all.
dirt just looking spread out.
do not use.these guys.
many better companies out there.
employees should be helping each other instead of hanging out outside.
if your not prepared to deliver.
definitely not satisfied or coming back.
just ordered delivery last night.
i ordered a medium three topping pizza and a large calzone, which was $36.
way over priced!
all cheese and hardly any toppings is a no go in my book.
so first time here for work.
check in was told no king beds so a double..i am 6 foot 3.
television did not work; they fixed it.
i will drive further for work next time.
everything is old and falling apart in this hotel.
i wish i could give negative stars to this business.
one wash per day is what the girl wash employee told me.
do you want to do business with someone that clearly falsely advertises?
was yelping to find an italian grocery store and found this place, sorely disappointing!
the choices are limited and it is outrageously expensive.
seriously, $6.99 for a can of san marzano tomatoes.
won't go back there anytime soon.
worst walgreens pharmacy i've everrrr been too.
whatever you do, do not go here!!!
trash was over flowing.
soda machine was down behind the counter and the machine used by the public.
mr. carl would turn over in his grave with disappointment
there are only a handful of tables full and two servers.
but no more.
not sure what has changed but the service now is horrible.
and the food quality is equally as poor.
i'm not sure how a restaurant can go downhill so quickly?
after asking to replace the drink he came outside and stared us down.
unfortunately we will not be back!
impossible to convey what an absolute inept operation westgate sportsbook presents.
this the slowest fast food place ever.
they are quick to take your money but 25mins later still waiting.
the only reason we haven't left i'd because we already paid.
theft is a problem at the venetian.
risk management and security feign concern but do nothing.
requests that footage from security cameras be viewed are ignored.
the staff won't.
they have became nothing more than a sales person.
needless to say they are no longer training their employees on the details.
i wish i could give this company negative stars.
i applied to rent a home with this company.
they are rude, inappropriate, and unprofessional.
wilbur caminero is the leasing person i dealt with and he is a crook.
you can tell he just wants money.
the whole process seemed so fishy.
hopefully people will do their research before they decide to apply.
i am glad i did before i signed a lease or paid a deposit.
we went in today to look at bluetooth players.
first time visiting the sandwich.
sandwich was ok considering the tomatoes could have been fresher.
upon my last bite, i found a tiny baby roach crawling in my wrapper.
i will never return.
after reading the review from the zarina i want to give them a try.
i won't recommend anyone to come here.
get some quality acts please.
what's the point of walk ins???
has to be one of the driest sandwiches ever.
also it comes with one peperchini for each side i'm mean come on really?
each time, i experienced a very uncomfortable and unprofessional experience with the owner/manager, frank(?).
he threatened to sue her if she didn't get out of his salon.
the second time, he was yelling at his employees, much like a pimp.
the third time, he had an altercation with a city inspector.
i go to spas to get relaxed, and to leave stress behind.
i will never go back.
overrated and expensive.
find alternatives if you can!
took me once, but you can bet i won't be back.
i guess shame on me for not looking at the menu.
really disappointing food quality from a higher end italian restaurant.
we ordered the gourmet burger and a pizza, as well as tiramisu.
everything seemed on par with a fast food diner.
this place should not be used in the same sentence as a gay bar/club.
boring music, lame, tired old crowd/workers...
i made the extra effort to come to ihop just for a bad experience.
i'd say the best thing out of my meal was the wheat bread.
they said that they can only give it on the side.
afterwards when the extra noodles came, the ramen has no soup in them.
not even edible.
the quality of the food is poor.
never will return.
five items separately!
our experience has been a nightmare!
i would give less stars if i could!
the unit we purchased (grand design momentum) is garbage and the service is terrible!!!
their theory is the issues are the manufacturer's issues not theirs!
last few visits (and not that late either...).
no slices available.
or calibreze; also more people friendly and they have food available!
ordered the new nacho fries box and got a small bag barely full.
don't go to this taco bell.
worst fucking company ever.
don't rent with them.
not worth the troubles.
possibly the worst sound system i've ever experienced.
definitely never going there again.
very in-authentic indian catering to the folks who have probably never tried indian food.
kanji lemonade - not only had no kanji, it had no fresh squeezed lemon.
it was just hi-c.
samosas were soooo bland and made from tortilla.
garlic naan was cold, burnt - how can one mess up on naan?!
ordered spicy version of saag paneer - same bland taste as other mild dishes.
achar was dry and old.
all in all - complete waste of money, time and taste.
i asked for a menu and she threw it at me.
her name is mj and will probably spit in your food
really, who runs a business like this.
i have no idea why this restaurant won so many awards.
it was a huge disappointment.
everything we ate was good, but nothing exceptional.
and certainly nothing worth the price we paid.
overall, i would not recommend this restaurant.
for the prices they charge, save your money & go eat somewhere else.
this is my clinic." no lab coat, no name tag, no introduction, no nothing.
i felt uneasy and left.
i called the clinic to make sure this was indeed the same person.
this place seems shady.
why would they schedule a 8:35a appointment when they don't open until 9a?!
they only serve 2 side dishes for a single person.
service was average, nothing spectacular to warrant 18% gratuity.
i would not recommend this place.
they were in business for over 25 years.
terrible service and an overpriced menu.
terribly run place.
worst location ever!!!
customer service is horrible!
came here with a friend to shop and the staff here are just horrible!
the store was very dirty and we couldn't find anything.
bad customer service ever i never see ...
it's the guys serviced for us...
was there on 3/23/18 food was ok.
the manager  went around and spoke to everyone's table except mine.
worst service ever!
i ordered soup and it came without crackers.
when i asked for them they didn't come until i was almost finished.
my husband ordered a salad with his spaghetti.
the salad didn't come until he was half finished with his spaghetti.
no apology for any of it.
the food was mediocre at best.
the food was a 2 stars...
plus one of the waiters was really rude!!
i just assume he was having a bad day..
needs work alot of work  wine and beer selection is crap!!
veggies is old not fresh at all and everything is over priced.
i will take my money elsewhere and you should too!!!!
cafeteria quality food and subpar service.
manager was quite rude when the server made a mistake on our order.....
their coffee drinks are delicious but it didn't make up for the rest.
we went elsewhere and won't be returning.
i love the food and usually have adequate service- until today.
i understand that servers work hard here but this service was unacceptable.
first and foremost it's terribly expensive!
every thing is  la cart.
by far the worst steak i've  ever experienced.!
go to ruth chris at harrahs!!
they used to have a young guy working there that was pretty good.
i'm not impressed.
absolutely the worst customer service anywhere.
this is my local costco and i shop here very often.
every single time i shop here, the cashiers rarely engage the customers.
they are always more interested in gossiping with each other than talking to customers.
miraculously nothing broke, but this behavior is absolutely unacceptable.
service has been slow
the couple next to us was appalled.
we love something classic and really respect the owner.
we also understand sometimes the talent hired isn't a good as once thought.
friends have shared the same and will be posting and not returning
this place is a joke.
there's nothing expedited about that.
highly disappointing as he was to be one of the highlights of our trip.
encore should be embarrassed.
as hard to find someone to help you as a wal-mart.
they almost always make a mistake and overcharge me for something :(
i would stay away from this restaurant.
what would you call to this?
too bad i can't give a 0 star have to give one.
i will never eat here again.
i wasn't even greated nor was there an apology for me having to wait.
and when i got my pizza the cuts were so un even.
i'll stick with them for my late night delivery .
does pan asian mean f*** your stomachs up long time in english?
there breakfast burrito's are terrible.
i ordered 2 and it cost me $14.
spend $2 at mcdonalds and it will taste better.
i'm giving one star because it won't allow me to leave none.
according to their google hours they are open until 4:30 through the week.
this will be my last visit to this discount tire.
all in all, just rude behavior.
i do not recommend this location if this is how you treat customers.
overpriced over-the-counter candy.
not banging around, not throwing.
she would take them out of the box then put them back in.
yes, it's probably mildly annoying.
but she's 2, and it is a candy store.
employee came and reprimanded her.
the worst of the worst......
don't even think or get attempt by it from buy one get one coupon....
very narrow choices of food and taste is the worst..
everything is either sweet or way too salty...
i couldn't even eat two plates...
will never come back....
this place has the worst communication!!
i then call for them to have the worst customer service!!
& they don't know where their delivery guy is!!!
i'll never order anything else from them worst customer service & delivery is horrible!!!
they lost my friends dog, then neglected to tell them for hours.
still no explanation.
thankfully winni was found.
the worst for getting you there on time.
this is on more than one occasion too.
the only saving grace is that the employees are very nice.
that's where the one star comes from
they almost killed my dog!!
i usually don't write reviews because i am busy but this is an exception.
"1st off lady helping us was just doing her job, bus driver was awesome.
offside location has transients all over strip mall that car rental was located.
very mis leading and time consuming , uncomfortable experience."
this place is a dump!
all appliances are very old and don't work right.
and they will take your deposit no matter how you leave the place.
worst run complex i have ever lived in.
don't waste your time here.
if i could give zero stars i would.
a girl name jess helped my friends and i out.
no customer service at all.
it is my 21st birthday she didn't help us out at all.
rolled her eyes everytime i had a question.
we had to ask someone else to help us.
jess was very rude.
i will not eat here again.
the spicy chicken and brown rice tasted just like teriyaki madness.
this place is for suckers.
they put pictures of cars online that they don't really have.
that really really irks me.
we had a salesman before we even got out of our car.
he immediately started lying through his teeth.
this place is a joke.
i have no idea where they get their prices from.
jacked up thousands of dollars.
i highly do not recommend.
their food is not good because it's salty.
they also don't give free refills.
i do not like it here.
food was nothing special
worse business ever!
out to lunch, closed early, at other office, etc.
always some excuse!
stay away and go some where else.
the service was terrible, food was overpriced and small portions.
have no plans to return.
this place is horrible.
little in stock, unorganized, horrible customer service.
go to the pacsun at the south outlet.
i would not have given this a one if i could possibly.
all of the food was disgusting barely edible.
it seems as if they served us the food from the night before.
i swear i would go hungry for the day then to eat this food.
not even if it were free.
please save your money the food is inedible.
save your money and go someplace else!!!!!
they use velvetta cheese for nachos can you imagine?
on a positive note jackie was our server and she was absolutely delightful.
save your money go elsewhere.
recently had lunch here, it was not great.
mac and cheese did have bacon, which was the only flavour in the dish.
bland, soupy and overcooked pasta, blah.
not worth a second try.
lobby area smells like someone was smoking marijuana as we entered to check-in.
the night clerk was nowhere to be seen.
waited several minutes until he returned to his post.
the room was not cleaned well.
hair in bathtub, dirty sink, cheap mattress and linen, no blankets.
thin walls so you heard everything.
gyro pita was a disappointment.
the pita was hard on the edges and did not seem fresh.
the sauce was very sour.
do not order greek fries...they were old and soooo bad.
go to the one by chandler fashion or express location on kyrene and warner.
i ordered nachos, soft serve ice cream, and a salad.
probably the easiest things to prepare.
terrible service and they didn't care on bit.
i will never go back!
we came in for lunch here.
the restaurant has two levels.
we we're group of 9 adults and a kid.
the place was pathetic.
we were not given napkins or silverware.
the pho was poor and trying to eat with aplastic spoon was a challenge.
would not recommend this place for service or food!
i see this deal is still up there - i don't know why.
as far as the carpet cleaning went - he did a good job.
just don't buy the deal.
service not good at all.
this is the worst mechanic i have ever been to.
the owner jim is a lying smooth talking thief.
he charges for work not completed, does unreliable work, nd is extremely unreliable.
i've had brakes done, engine work, and it has all ended horrendously.
please, save yourself and don't go here.
your health and wallet will both thank you.
i give 0 stars
staff is absolutely horrible, and management is worse.
i ordered a meal was told no side and smoothie was not discounted.
i was charged for each item separately.
when i spoke to manager he was not apologetic.
i will only visit tropical smoothie at university circle now.
the floors and carpets were not cleaned.
this is defiantly not something that the health inspector in arizona would approve of.
had an appointment at 3:00 and waited 45 minutes with 2 animals.
not good at all!
terrible experience, and they never acknowledge the ridiculous wait time.
time to find a new veterinarian.
enough is enough.
horrible service from bobby.
months of headaches.
not worth it.
not happy that i cannot speak with anyone when i call.
they do not call back promptly to setup appointments and follow ups.
been trying to get in all week for a med check.
we called 3 times yesterday and once today and still haven't been called back.
i visited the t-mobile to see queen.
not well planned out at all.
bottles of water are pricey within the venue - $5 for desani.
i really wanted to like this place.
sadly i've got to admit i was disappointed .
yes , the sweet potato fries rocked but the place isn't called barefries .
it's called bareburger and the burger was dry and tasteless !
i won't be coming back .
my neighborhood greasy spoon does a better job at a fraction of the price!
breakfast was horrible.
pancakes tasted funny.
scrambled eggs were more fried then scrambled.
bacon was like burnt leather.
at least toast was good.
but to be fair my wife liked her scrambled platter.
unfortunately their product doesn't make up for their pathetic attitudes and services.
perhaps someday everything will improve at this establishment.
salty, greasy pizza with clueless staff.
while they were preparing, the lady kept looking at us the weird way.
when my friend went to the counter to pay for it, he looked confused.
we realized she misinformed him about the price.
stayed here for two nights over the weekend and was greatly disappointed.
yes the suites are big but that's all this place has going for it.
maybe because i booked through expedia?
i wasn't given a clear reason why but this seemed like a basic request.
watch you bill!
i was double billed for 2 tickets.
on top of that, my son got sick before we went on the tour.
instead of refunding the ticket ($47), they charged us an additional $47!
since we are out of town this must be intentional.
if i could give a negative star i would...doesn't even deserve one.
we ordered drinks, appetizers and an entree to share...
the production is really good, movie quality.
it's meant to slow you down so their easy puzzles seem harder.
this is not an escape room, it's an interactive haunted house.
it sucks if you're experienced with escape rooms.
do not recommend.
plus, it's really expensive.
gotta pay those royalty fees to lionsgate.
if i have to rate zero star, i would!
they gave us bbq pork end burn piece.
we don't even feel any ac on while it is over 100 degree outside.

ridiculous over charge for bad service.
do not recommend anyone.
great customer service but disappointed in product.
had to return to my black and decker corded trimmer to finish the job.
now i have a very expensive paper weight.
i walked out of there with nothing no sweets or anything for that matter.
pissed off at every single person.
they will drop the ball if they choose so.
not the way to run a business.
service is the worst from front to back!!!
this will make for a negative plus posting.
i can understand if i ordered one meal and asked for free sauce...
awful awful awful.
the coffee is awful.
ohhhh buuut they have a fire place, and some glass ceiling...it's so cozy!
for proper coffee in k town, hit up house.
maybe in grand prairie this place would pass...
usually a favorite of mine.
this time it went from bad to worse.
ordered the fajitas.
came out semi warm and the tortillas were cold.
asked for some warm ones and they took so long the meat was cold.
probably will not be coming back.
so long and adios.
a friend recommended this doctor, 15 mins on hold before i hung up.
couldn't even make an appointment.
from the time i walked into this place i felt uneasy.
the salsa has no flavor and the chips taste like oil.
i will definitely not be returning.
well an update.
long story short again still not happy and absolutely nothing has changed.
don't waste your money.
went here late night/early morning and it was a disaster.
we were outraged!
even though we had already placed our orders we left and will never return.
it doesn't work and i can't get customer support after spending $600.
how is this company still open?
i just moved here from chicago.
lord help me.
friendly but slow, inaccurate service and lukewarm, inauthentic "mexican" cuisine.
first and last time.
change the air freshener you use!
it smells like ironing spray.
i can't stand it!
absolute worst service ever!
then when they came they were not the right drinks!
waitress took forever to refill our water.
my family and i live eating at olive garden.
we love their food.
this review is specifically for the location next to the superstition springs mall.
smiling and happy servers, waiters make for a happy eating out experience.
the peopl here don't care about the customer.
the nurse had no idea what i was saying and barely spoke english.
the location is in the ghetto but it is very contemporary designed and clean.
they took my sierra health and life ppo insurance.
what the hell is wrong with this place.
terrible customer service.
not only is that not true, but you could have called!!!
will never come here again.
their female tech are good, but males are horrible.
the female boss insist use male tech.
we didn't do the service and will never come again.
awful, horrible experience.
my nail chipped (french manicure) the next morning?
called, went bk, fixed chipped nail, omgosh, chipped that night again.
do not get bio gel....
(i'd give no stars but can't post this!)
4rth of july and my prism service  and internet went off.
looks like this happens on holidays and big event.
it happened to me during the super bowl too.
can you believe that?
looks like they are having an overload they cannot handle.
the worst internet and tv provider ever.
ewwww...i feel worried..should have left.
..her tools are out of date.she ripped the nails in half...argh...i could go o.
many different and spread out stations, each with only a few bad choices.
even the cocktail shrimp were very "shrimpy" tasting, not good.
i would have been disappointed with this buffet even if it was completely comped.
hot waitresses in skimpy outfitsb.
my husband and i have tryied different wing places and this place really dissappoints.
the service was ok but not enough to keep u coming back.
too bad you couldnt live upto your name st. louis!
the food was not good and is too expensive.
the bar is too loud and the lighting was horrible.
i would not go there again.
stayed here almost 5 different times now.
all times great until today.
was told i had to pay a $75 early check in fee.
but they 'waived' it to $45 instead since i 'upgraded'...
called front desk and all the offer is the maid to come up immediately.
this office is very incompetent.
waitress didn't smile once or check in on us.
forgot soy sauce bowls and waters more than once.
food came out at different times.
sushi haphazardly rolled and falling apart.
rice to sashimi ratio wasn't good.
no water refills.
i found a hair in my food.
one of the worst dining experiences i've had.
guess what -- i still remember how bad of an experience we had.
lunch stop here blew my budget and was a disappointment.
hand roll of salmon skin had unrecognizable crumbs of fried something.
even ginger condiment was a small pile of half shavings.
edamame was not fresh.
prices inappropriate for quality & ambience; too many wooden fence panels indoors for me.
restaurant was clean.
server provided entrees while talking on the phone.
many units leased to younger people with no manners.
also, association does little to solve problems.
we are fed up.
thought we were buying a "luxury property ".
not enough dinner ware.
waited forever food and service.
prices are insane.
biggest gripe: didn't even get my cocktail.
without a doubt, my sunday plans included coming here for breakfast.
it's sad to say that y'all have lost a loyal costumer.
this is just one of many examples of the slip in costumer service.
terrible company with terrible business practices.
he didn't care that his company was doing something disgustingly illegal.
what a joke!
such a dissapointment.
the dj was bad, the beers came out warm?
they should clean it up and change the music.
i decided to find a new dr since dr.mcghee left.
and i agree!
and i know many people that feel the same way :(
i came in with a phone that was stuck on the startup screen.
i had an appointment but still had to wait 30 minutes.
finally it was my turned to be helped.
i gave him a briefing and asked what could have caused it.
he said, and i quote, "i don't get paid to know that.
so he plugged my phone into itunes.
company is going downhill and guess what nobody cares.
manager and other bartenders are rude only sit and talk to their friends .
unless your friends with the manager or bartenders
first off talk to your customers....make sure all the fixans are what they want.
everyone makes their differently.
i hate olives and i hate pickles so wtf.
anyways never never coming back to this expensive sh*t ever again.
gross gross gross.
waited 2 hours for an order only to receive it partially cooked and soggy.
they then disconnected again.
when we called back they had switched the phones off.
will not try again.
management and service are horrible here.
i've been making copies off of my usb drive here for years.
today i was told $2.50 to make copies plus additional fee per page.
are you serious?
does it cost $2.50 to plug something into a computer?
i've had them give me copies for cheap.
if you're not making money then don't offer the service!
i purchased the living social deal and what a waste of money.
went on a friday night (5/18) and the waiter suggested to get all-you-can-eat fish-n-chips.
after 1 refill, we left.
fried fish is good, but service is awful.
too many good restaurants in chandler....i won't be back anytime soon.
i recommend avoiding this place at all costs.
i ended up with fungus infested nails after one trip to this salon.
i had high hopes, but ended up extremely disappointed.
they could have at least saved themselves some respect by doing that for free.
i'll never return.
been coming here for over 10 years and this is a first.
my sandwich was good though so i let it go.
we paid our bill and left.
banquet here tonight.
the food was inedible and the wine completely undrinkable.
service was rude...
if you must attend an event here, absolutely eat before you go.
my rating is very valid because it was my experience with your company.
yes, i do know groupons terms and a stores terms, thank you for clarifying.
as a customer, we decide where we want to spend our money.
horrible experience with a pizza delivery which was for a birthday party.
the pizza took almost 2 hours to arrive.
not even the microwave or oven could save those dry and cold ass pizzas.
i checked my order and clearly asked for marinara sauce.
they baked these pizzas with just cheese on top of bread smh!
will not use this pizza hut again.
i recommend you check your food before they just drop if off.
this was strange as the place was pretty dead.
by far the worse sam woo.
never returning here ever again.
sam woo take back this store!!!
this specific location did not greet us or acknowledge we were there.
now usually if you make eye contact someone will atleast say hello.
i was there with my husband and family for 20 minutes before we left.
needless to say another store got our business.
i will tell everyone of the experience we had here.
got thursday chicken special.
what are they serving?
look like crap.
we are done going here.
there is still nandos and popeyes
really terrible experience.
waited an hour for a sandwich.
and then didn't even give me what i ordered.
i love bbq.
but won't come back here  stay away.
this place has progressively went downhill.
we will not be back again!
the waitresses at this bar wait station are seem very tired and worn out.
then they are rude to you as well.
would not help me sitting right by the wait station!
they all kept telling me it's not their section!
then the rude lady assigned to my area/machine finally serves me a drink!
please avoid this bar!
almost missed my flight because of their slow service.
will never ever dine there.
semi helpful almost really depressed employees.
i don't know about these great reviews to be honest.
definitely not going back.
easily the worst restaurant service i've experienced combined with incorrect orders and mediocre food.
feels like any other option would be better.
please never ever use them !!!
they blocked our number.
blocked us on instagram and refused to respond to emails.
please don't make the same mistake we did and go with these crooks!
awful awful place.
she is 5.
my older son who was also there confirmed what my youngest had said.
they have such a high turn over rate when it comes to "teachers".
which i have brought up before to the female owner.
which she denied.
i am just so done with this daycare.
today was my daughters last day.
worst service i have ever experienced.
our appetizer also came after our meals did.
apparently, they reserve the right to move it...like to the next day.
not very nice and now i have to go find someone else.
not like moving is stressful enough, but they have to add to it.
i have no plans to return to buy anything from them!
bad customer service all around and i will take my business elsewhere.
the cashiers are crooks.
who asked you to tip yourself?
i'm never coming back here in so disappointed.
horrible customer service.
the tickets are a little cheaper, but that's defiantly not worth it.
stayed in line to check-in my bag for 3.5 hours.
also it's not very safe to fly them: http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/nevada/allegiant-flight-las-vegas-diverted-due-maintenance-issue
i've worked in retail) i politely declined.
but everyone else stared at me with a blank stare and wasn't any help.
the token system was an absolute disaster.
the tacos were slop, not impressed at all.
margaritas were all syrup didn't even taste any tequila at all.
save your money and just make tacos at home.
finally tried culver's.
the concrete taste exactly like mcdonalds.
even the ketchup was nasty.
how do you screw up ketchup?
i posted a picture that says yummy in my tummy...i lied...
really bad customer service !
indian gate certainly knows how to charge ...
$113.00 for a dinner for 4 ....
at this time, my installation was scheduled for three weeks ago.
it was delayed to oct.
i called the day before and left a message 8 times.
never got an answer.
no one showed up and currently i am out $2000.
should not use this company unless this gets resolved quickly.
ashley furniture got my business that day!
i went here few days ago for a pedicure.
the lady who i believe was the owner did my pedicure.
i felt so disappointed that my pedicure was rushed.
i won't come back.
very scrupulous and unfair loan dept.
rude, unhelpful staff.
threw it away in the parking lot.
would loved to have known that before ordering an $11 orange juice.
will not be back.
great atmosphere other than all the san fran giants crap.
airline broke my luggage (120.00cad value).
paid 1418.00 for 7 nights for 2 adults.
due to hurricane, we did not use 4 nights.
essentially that is 18.75cad for each night stayed at a 3-star all-inclusive resort.
i felt it was a sexist statement and derogatory question.
this place sadly has gone down hill over the years.
asides from the horrible service the quality of the food has also turned horrible.
disappointed as a regular.
will never recommend this place again.
i ordered a veggie pizza and received a crispy burnt veggie pizza.
oh, and they don't give refunds!
"we don't give refunds, but we will make you another pizza".....bye felicia!
don't waste your money on their food.
so unbelievably unprofessional.
my worst experience ever renting a car.
he never made it till 3 days later .very unreliable .
now that i see this i'm glad that i switch to bond bread .
their bread it's way better
the loooooooongest wait for my order ever.
the food choices are the worst in buffet history.
i bought a groupon dinner and unlimited alcohol, and even the moscato was nasty.
i wouldn't recommend this place to my enemy.
horrible and poor service.
gnats flying around...a waste.
i was very disappointed.
who cant draw a heart an tattoos for a living.
paid 60$ for a 5 min rush in poke.
if you are looking to over pay here is the shop to overpay at!
typical chinese restaurant which is fine with me.
love them, always check them out.
food was what you expected.
tasted great, great service.
so why the 1 star?
this is the first time i've ever found a bug in my food.
positive side, atleast i liked my good while i ate it.
not sure how else to put it: this store straight up sucks.
the produce is always terrible, especially on weekends after the decent produce is gone.
stuff that is on sale sells out really quickly.
the store is always messy.
thankfully, that no frills closed and relocated on bloor in a way nicer space.
no need to drag myself to food basics anymore!
constantly out of cups and carry out containers.
customer service is terrible and it's always dirty!
first visit was last night and food was delivered at a tepid temperature.
the cauliflower was actually cold to the touch.
won't be back.
we went in with a coupon for a buy one get one half off.
then charged us full price.
i asked if this was half price and she assured me that it was.
i guess they do not really want our business.
healthcare in southern nevada is bad, but these clowns make it worse.
what a ridiculous experience i had at this starbucks.
i ordered three drinks totaling around $10.
i offered a $20 which was s little mangled but definitely in one piece.
what kind of training does starbucks provide to their staff?
apparently they got new menus?
well they suck.
uhhh ok, ill just dip.
we both thought it was odd the sandwiches came out so fast.
it was like they were hanging out under a lamp.
for the price you pay here for food i was extremely annoyed.
we arrived at the payless service desk earlier than anticipated.
the csr asked us to wait saying he had found a car.
every thing was soggy and so bad.
you can tell they buy their food frozen and warm it up.
i can make better greek food at home.
thw greek fries were soggy
the ambiance was nice vintage like, very cute setting.
when i got the menu there's definitely more drinks on it than food.
i felt like the pizza place should of been called wine and bite.
for someone like me who enjoys trying new food.
it's false adverstiment pizzeria bianco...
but the price is too high,$19.99 for one order.
you know the frozen filet in super market only sold for $2.00/lb.
this store is a total waste.
whom ever does the buying doesn't know their job.
how can a store be out of whole milk and eggs.
this isn't the first time it has happened.
i asked to speak to a manager and was told she was on break.
girl at the registered could have cared less.
the pharmacy needs about 5 more people working in it.
i wait over 90 minutes for a prescription they told would take 15.
completely uncalled for.
i would have come back instead of waiting
place was empty when my friend and i came in...
the sushi was just ok...
every time i'd pick you a sushi with my chopsticks the sushi fell apart.
we ended up using our fingers to hold the sushi together.
we had no plates...
it was pretty sucky.
absolutely the slowest store in vegas.
jeff and edwin mcguire made the process very frustrating.
they were unprofessional and did not know how the process works.
they pulled credit multiple times and could not explain the reason why.
literally the worst walgreens i've ever dealt with.
pharmacy staff is ever-changing and consistently lazy.
i am looking into switching to cvs today.
this place definitely having some management issues.
stay away of this place !!!
don't waste your time.
unless you have a 3 hour layover.
this used to be the best thai restaurant in toronto hands down.
today it is merely a shell of its former self.
cheap quality meats, little to no english speaking workers, unorganized, and penny pinching owners.
recently i saw her working at su&shi yorkdale.
this restaurant is only a memory now.
i won't be back.
none of us finished our food.
the best part of the meal was the cookie....
the burger was covered in grill scrapings!
nastiest thing ever!
don't eat here unless you have no other options.
chicken waffles are no good.
chicken was meh, waffles were hard af.
slow service also.
this is a review for https://www.budget.com.
i was a victim of a bait & switch.
i needed to rent a vehicle that could hold 7 people.
i picked a cadillac escalade and used budgets "paynow" and saved a few bucks.
i did everything online, reserved the car and paid.
as a admitted bagel-snob, i seriously don't understand the hype about this place.
the fillings aren't bad, but the bagels are just plain bad.
they're not dense and don't crunch on the bottom like a true bagel should.
the second time was just as bad.
not worth the trip or the money.
the worst service steer clear!
avoid this company at all costs!!
extremely rude, mean workers..whoever the older lady is at the front desk...
she needs to be fired.
she grabbed my box, huffed obnoxiously loud, and threw my box across the counter.
what a nightmare.
i usually habe the egg benedict and it comes with big heap of potato.
my other friend got the grand slam.
it is as big as sizeable family meal.
if you want to go food coma, then this place is great.
the design and layout was old and out dated but friendly atmosphere.
this review isn't so much about service but atmosphere and tidiness.
which this location does not know anything about.
i mean, come on people!!
who in their right mind would allow this to keep going on?!
it was a joke!
obviously this person is a hoarder or just likes working in mess and disorganization.
so disappointed with this place.
we order lunch everyday and we decided to order from them today.
southwestern chicken salad had huge bones and no dressing at all.
black bean burger was dry and didn't have a side dish.
staff is rude and our company will never order from them again!!!
the lady who works here though is extremely rude and unprofessional.
i will go across the street to post net across the street instead.
the worst customer service ever!!!!
the eastern european girl at cash is incredibly rude!
why the hell would you care!
never going back to this place!!
do not recommend to anyone either!!!
not even close.
i would avoid  this place if you want a good cut
$18 for carne asada taco plate and carne asada burrito with 2 drinks.
rice & beans were bland.
meat was greasy with no seasoning.
received a card for $20 when i dined at roy's for my birthday.
the waitress explained that i could use it at anytime.
thanks for the disappointment.
are you in the mood for this school and terrible teachers?
then this is the school for you!
my experience was terrible!
the temperature in the dining area was 89 degrees!
when we asked them to turn the air conditioning higher they gave us attitude!
never eating here again!
but there was also an issue with the level of heat on our dishes.
they weren't hot and out waiter assured us that the food came out hot.
i think i'll skip this location next time...
extremely poor service on oct.
the boss was rude.
t mobile needs to teach their supervisors common courtesy.
i am a good customer.
i have over 4 lines and years being a customer.
do not shop at this store.
rude, rude rude.
do not shop at this store.
i wish i could give this bar a 0.
we wanted to go because we had been the previous night and enjoyed it.
the men outside were demeaning and rude beyond belief, bringing us to tears.
this place is a joke...
service is terrible.
we literally were told they ran out of knives because everyone was stealing them.
food is sub par.
don't waste your time in this place.
by far one of the worst clinic's to go too!
like other reviews about this clinic.
the wait time is way to long!
waiting for 5 hours is unacceptable!
the staff is another issue.
most are spanish speaking and are rude.
we will be sure to never visit this establishment again.
pressed it again and again nothing!
i'm not gonna chase anyone down, that's why you have these stupid ass buttons!
i waited for 20 minutes just to see what would happen and nothing!
crust tastes raw.
not crispy, soggy and chewy.
barely melts cheese.
very slow service.
had them redo them.
still waiting on our food.
shouldn't ever take over an hour to get food this is crazy.
the one thing this place has going for it is location to pnc park.
food is subpar and generally takes about 3x longer to be made than normal.
bartenders are generally overwhelmed and with that comes bad attitudes and lack of attentiveness.
it's truly amazing that this place is still open.
darius was a very cool person!!
he was dancing with me and my friends and was awesome!
however, our server was horrid along with security.
none of us were doing anything wrong, yet we all felt so uncomfortable.
i do not appreciate this!!!
what's ironic is that they offer an ethics class.
that would be like john wayne gacy running a pre-school.
tina and the staff had great friendly customer service.
never had i had a problem with past salons before.
customer service is great, but def improvement in the quality service is needed.
i was here on a sunday night and the kitchen was slammed.
my friend told me you should never order seafood in the desert.
horrible customer service.
rude management and sales people.
consistently inconsistent liquids.
been buying here for three years and lately they just can't get it right.
instead of fixing an issue they would rather tell you to go somewhere else.
my pleasure to go elsewhere, you're not the only rodeo in town.
please take head they are not worth the time or efort.
very over priced, food is not great and super small place.
not happy dinning here.
what a joke!!
one n done with this place!!
hour and a half later i walked out with food....really????
add insult to injury...food sucked!!!!
yelp backs a bitch!!!
this place is a joke!
she tells me it depends on what part of chicago your from!!!!!
are you serious?
come on lady, if your going to represent chi town.....do it right!
they weren't ready.
i had to wait again.
this is insane.
i could maaaaaaaaybe forgive if it was busy in here but it's not!
how hard is it to make some freaking sandwiches?!
i joined lvac hoping i could get in shape by going swimming.
there is enough chlorine in the pool to burn out your eye balls.
my phone number is 702-689-1365.
if you have had a problem with lvacs fraudulent sales practices please call me.
the employees here are a bunch of idiots.
not very helpful at all.
it says spend 10.00 and get 20% off.
didn't get my discount.
a bit disappointed with the lack of follow up on this store location.
1) ordered 2 butter chicken combos.
3) the salad was so disgusting and old.
5) naan bread was so oily and burnt.
of course the extended warranty my friend paid extra for didn't cover this!
ever time i drive by here i cringe.
please go anywhere else.
walked in just now put our name in for 4.
i absolutely love thai food and order it all the time.
i've been to thailand and tried almost ever single thai dish there is.
my boyfriend's pad thai was so sad looking (again with 2-3 pieces of.
be careful when come here.
the female owner is not honest.
we turned off our phone but none of the workers did.
the two females constantly talking to each other while massaging.
i won't recommend coming here.
very disappointing performance.
this team ought to consider adding some quality control to its window service.
worst home warranty service.
and now we have a past due bill from them.
they don`t even deserve  one star.
what a waste of money.
this place used to be awesome.
don't go there.
quality has taken a nosedive since changing hands.
nothing is as good as it was.
now it's just crap.
under new management.
the menu, service, price and vibe are not good.
three bad experiences over past month.
so we walked out and went to stone and vine.
self checkout lanes everywhere it's like you're an employee.
this is not the future.
bill burr is right.
i'm boycotting self checkout from now on.
very poor experience.
waited an hour for food that never came.
they never put in our appetizer.
people around us who came in after us got served and left.
the water tastes like it came out of a bucket.
never even got to try the food.
i won't be returning anytime soon.
the owner never even apologized.
i wouldn't even eat there for free.
barely got it figured out by the end of the season.
i tried to take pictures on my cell phone.
i was stopped by the security guard and told to delete them.
i will not be returning to this store.
please be open and free.
all and all, just meh.
the overall quality and presentation left much to be desired.
for this price point i'd have expected top shelf on both counts.
shrimp was small and translucent, unappetizing.
king crab tasted ok but was small.
split legs were a nice touch.
just generally a disappointment.
good service but did not enjoy the food.
nevertheless, we are unlikely to try this place again..
there's way better food in vegas.
i usually take the megabus because it is cheap and ok in comfort.
and of course they had absolutely no morsal of sympathy and were horribly rude.
moral of the story: read all the fine print on your receipt.
i went to matt's today for the first time with my wife.
well if this was the best place "phoenix we have a problem".
my wife ordered coffee and it was cold and the cup was cracked.
my wife ordered eggs & bacon with hash browns.
they gave her cold eggs burnt bacon and potatoes not hash browns.
really very disappointing and i  expected to love the food.
included in the pile was one that i decided to use.
when checking out, the coupon would not work.
the saleslady shrugged her shoulder and blamed it on the computer.
sears will continue to kill trees but i will never shop there again.
what a fiasco!
horrible just horrible.
i done nothing wrong.
no good place to eat.
i should of been in and out in 5-10 mins tops.
apple store need a better system.
i paid 8 dollars for some broth w barely any noodles in it!
you know what i can buy w 8 dollars???
8 dollars should mean a big bowl of food.
and i got a ham sandwich and it was nast-ay.
go too lee's sandwich instead for reals
the customer service here, or lack thereof, is awful!
but did we get any word from the associates or help at all?
take some tips from journey's, vans.
i was enjoying my day until i walked in to this store.
initially, everyone was nice and helpful.
however, it led into feeling like i was being harassed into making purchases.
feeling like they have to buy something.
i'm starting to get pissed off with this place.
last year they were great this year not so much.
my yard looks terrible a week later.
plants, bushes aren't trimmed and scheduled cuts are not on time.
i hope they get it together before they lose customers.
just dropped to 17 bucks on a burger and a salad with my wife.
there obviously hurting for money.
i hope they don't go out.
he's got to a sign  up that says hiring all positions.
maybe i should ask for one laying down!
poor first impression.
last chance they'll get.
i'm driving around the shopping center and can't find it!
i call and they tell me that location isn't there because it's under renovation.
how crazy is it that they didn't tell me that pertinent piece of info?
i also feel bad for the therapist who lost the appt.
they won't book new patients for same day appointments.
this place is horrible don't get me wrong the room was okay..
avoid at all cost.
the bacon cheese fries were cold to the touch.
the fried pickles tasted like old oil.
totally messed up my drink order after i waited for it forever.
so my friend really wanted to come here for her birthday.
it looked fun and lively so we decided on here!
unfortunately, thats where the positivity ends.
we tried to call in a reservation, they don't have a phone number.
none of this info was online or told to us before we ordered.
not coming back.
came here for father's day.
what a major mistake.
do not come here unless you enjoy burnt burgers & burnt steaks.
what a joke.
my daughters did enjoy the ribs.
i can't give negative stars?
this was some bullsh*t.
totally screwed up the evening that my uncle had planned for us.
do not waste your time with this company!
my order was completely wrong.
are you kidding me????
if you want to develop a bowel problem, eat at piggly's!
rude receptionist, rude pa.
they do not prescribe pain meds as a rule.
pulled in at 9:30 am, no customers inside or at drive thru.
waited at speaker and nobody greeted me.
after a long wait i said hello and the lady said one moment.
will never return
it serve probably 3 people if they all had 3 pizza each.
not worth the savings.
very disappointed,  rice overcooked and soggy.
almost no teriyaki sauce, too much pineapple.
i fly thru charlotte frequently.
won't be recommending this.
it doesn't have any of the freshness i expect from genghis grill!
i walked out of that establishment without the food or my money back.
i will not return to this restaurant.
he took the drink back didn't say anything and returned with a new drink.
never spoke to a manager or anything he just sent me on my way!
i will be calling today!
dirty dirty dirty.
nice but unhelpful staff.
regret staying here.
wifi is free but the signal is incredibly weak.
no wonder its free.
mmm in n out is my favorite!
defiantly the best fast food burger in the world!!
awful service, concept, and food.
this restaurant is not appropriate for any occasion.
go to the kettle black or majerle's instead.
tried to go there this morning as i keep on hearing about their breakfast.
pulled in at 7:25.
the sign says 7-2, the hours on this site says the same...
but not a soul stirred in the darkened restaurant.
what a joke!!!!!!
these cooker bugs couldent cut a fart with a bean burrito!
they installed an amp & subs in a girls car that kept failing?
in layman's terms it's kinda like drinking gasoline & pissing on a bonfire!!!!!
no pos system meaning cash only.
we watched at least 11 people walk away.
today we ordered takeout for lunch and my order was refused.
i said 3 times, i would like my nails to be square square.
she stated because she thinks coffin is more elegant.
i thought they were my nails.
lan is wonderful!
she has moved on and so will i.
glad we do not have to deal with them anymore.
.we had high hopes for this place,  but we won't be back.
service was incredible slow--20 minutes to take a drink order.
our appetizer arrived at the same time as our main dish.
the teriyaki chicken was inedible, dry and bland.
spring rolls had no flavor.
the fried rice was greasy and unappetizing.
as a vegetarian, i was happy to see a veggie salad in the menu.
i did not realize it until a few bites into the salad...
i thought i give this place a try and not listen to the reviews.
boy was i wrong!
prices are way to expensive and portions are super small.
guys come on!
i'm going to have to stick with china go go.
our experience at this restaurant is one of the worst i've ever experienced.
the place is run by three teenagers who could care less about you.
the teenagers could care less.
i've never felt more unwelcome or unwanted in my life.
avoid this horrible place at all costs.
disappointed i don't write bad reviews food was not good service was horrible.
no follow through.
i work in service i would get fired.
extremely rude staff, careless and unwelcoming.
staff seems extremely unhappy to be here.
very unfortunate given its the only coffee near our gate.
the iced coffee we received was extremely watered down and tasted terrible.
terrible starbucks, and is hindering the name.
stick with uhaul!!!
i had the worst experience here this past sunday!
super unprofessional, they did not even open on time.
if i could rate it negative stars i would.
today may my least favorite 4th of july ever.
i cannot stand that places like this prey on the misfortunes of people.
absolutely the most disgusting food i have ever seen at a buffet.
i know its under $20 but there is a reason for that.
most of the food was inedible.
i basically ate cheese, crackers and salami, along with the stir-fry  veggies.
everything else was gross and a waste.
i cannot stress enough what a waste of money this place is.
please eat somewhere else.
the burger bun was awful.
i was looking forward because of the reviews.
i called 4 times in a week and half leaving a message each time.
i finally received a callback at 8:00 a.m. on a saturday morning.
i believe it was maryann that called.
luckily i was able to get a refund from groupon.
it's cheap and you get what you pay for.
my iron stomach is a total mess...
never felt this bad after sushi in my life.
as many others experienced we are delayed because they can fix the plane..
so delayed more than 4 hours..
he should be happy he has a job..
hours said open at 10am.
when i arrived, doors locked!
a hand written loose leaf paper says "closed for now!
re-opening soon" this was 10:50am!
i waited 20min...no movement.
still closed at 11:10am.
this is the first time i have been disappointed in canna.
let's hope this doesn't continue.
we were looking forward to the showing all week.
this place is a huge disappointment, run by some obviously shady and unprofessional people.
i will not use 1-800 flowers again.
it's really funny that the complaints are all the same.
you would figure that upper management would be very concerned, but they aren't.
worth waiting for.
no more apple, shame on them.
never never never go to paul mitchell school.
i drove 20 miles to go to there , and then they refused service.
the young man named fabian was extremely arrogant about the whole situation.
never go to that school.
they deserve zero stars as i received zero service.
not 1 person offered assistance.
i have purchased from ladlow's in the past and was pleased with the purchases.
i will never return to ladlow's.
no wonder the store was empty.
i went in with a rash on my hand.
i will not be going back to this studio for this reason.
the worst customer service ever!!
ripped off it should've cost me $29 shame on them.
and she didn't even push back my cuticles on my manicure.
they are nice people as they rip you off.
way to gouge the customer.
time to set sail captain tony!
very bad customer service.
i came in at 4:30 and waited and waited for anyone to address me.
finally at 5:01 they asked what i needed.
do not trust t-mobile, never never believe t-mobile reps, they are all liars.
how is it that a manager has blue hair?
besides the fact that their customer service is horrible!
not looking forward to coming back to this place!
all these high ratings for what?
we ordered the pho here and the broth tasted like hot water.
y'all don't season your food or what?
i walked out..wouldn't trust the food is handled properly based on what i see.
gives giant eagles a bad name.
the ordering process was extremely disorganized.
by the time i got through the line and paid, my tacos were cold.
the employees behind the counter can't even hear you because it's way too loud.
the food is sub-par, don't waste your time or money.
be very careful, these guys will pull your credit without your permission.
this is what i learnt just recently when got my equifax report.
i've never ever applied for a loan at big 4 motors.
i would give them a zero if i could.
one star is an compliment based on their service.
they insisted us to stay without any apology.
the manager was extremely rude and impatient .
the stuff act the same.
there are better restaurants in mississauga .
stay away as you don't want to experience the event i did.
staff is not polite, friendly or helpful and apparently their fans are broken.
disappointing because the patio is beautiful.
this is a great example of potential being squandered.
overall, lack of patient care!
very bad service!
i ordered cajun fries and they ended up not putting it into the system..
then i asked for it and they gave me a cajun fried rice...
and i'm now still waiting for my cajun fries
you get what you pay for.
they don't offer soap or shampoo.
they're very rude, and don't even try checking in before three.
they beds are a little hard.
the floors are hard wood which is fine.
yes, this place is inexpensive but save your sanity and go someplace else.
no prices in the store so be careful.
welcome to vegas!
zero starsdon't let these a holes touch your car.
this place is a rip off.
don't go to big o.
they will steal from you
i made the mistake of coming here again really only out of being desperate.
cause that's what you do here anyway...
they have no consideration of your time.
just picked up our $21 pizza.
pepperoni and mushrooms.
well, mushroom pieces, around a dozen small pieces.
you had to look hard to see them.
whole pizza very close to tasteless.
don't eat here!
beer is fine.
service is so-so.
the food is terrifically awful.
we got the nachos and the turkey club.
the nachos are not edible.
you're gonna get better chips in beige sauce at 711.
tldr: get a sandwich from timmies or starbucks and just get drinks here!
thanks for my $4 bacon breakfast sandwich; $5 if you include the soggy hashbrown.
i could have went to mcdonald's and gotten more meat on the dollar menu
ru san's just stole an hour of my life.
only go if you don't mind leaving hungry and exasperated.
lame!, it was for work with a credit card.
i guess they just losses out on $100.00 in business
really how long does it take to swipe a credit card!
the portion size is a lot smaller than typical chinese restaurant...
front desk service pushy.
they are rude.
don't come here.
i'd give negative stars if possible....
maybe thats why their walking around trying to sell t-shirts!??!
then it opened!!!!
my colleague suggested this place to me.
my hair looked almost same before and after the hair cut.
i had to pay $32 for the worst hair cut of my life.
totally unsatisfied with the hair cut
one of the worst airlines.
went to the airport ticket counter - no hotel, food or transportation expenses covered.
no solution, tough luck corporate doublespeak from the zombie ticket agent.
never fly allegiant
we, along with everybody else, waited over an hour for our car.
just go with one of the rental places at the airport.
i rarely complain about an establishment or give one star.
but this is the worst dd i have ever gone to.
staff had no clue how to take an order.
i asked for an iced half caf coffee with french vanilla.
it was so sweet i couldn't even drink it!
more like all french vanilla and no coffee.
never again will i come here!!!!
the worst the level of food is like a holiday inn.
nothing fresh all made hours ago even salads all drenched and vile
they should really consider remodeling their waiting room, and emphasizing good customer service!
this location used to be good ...
will not be going back to this location!
the second charge usually shows up a day after the first.
well guess what last night there was a double charge hit the card.
two drinks should not cost $70.00.
we will not be returning.
giving guy a 1 star because i love watching his show.
however my $19.50 hamburger doesn't deserve any stars.
in & out has a better tasting burger!
sorry dude not impressed and won't go back.
tonight was absolutely the worst experience.
he had chatted with a couple other people that were at the bar.
the other people left and i was the only one at the bar.
let's just say this bartender was the worst.
poor customer service.
discussing patient details without regard for who is around.
seems very disorganized.
misrepresentation of clinical staff.
there are plenty of better options in the area
spend your money elsewhere.
this place used to remind me of montreal cafes - grubby, friendly and warm.
new management have redecorated and made this cafe too similar to many other locals.
thr staff was really rude when we asked for a reschedule.
so rude that my 8 yr old refused to back to the swimming class.
and they still kept charging my credit card for 2 months.
when i asked for refund they refused.
never going back there!!
16 people in line, 2 tellers...
there has got to be a better way chase!
obviously people don't want to be pushed into using the atm...
despite the horrendous line we still want to talk to a live human being!
we even waited so long to get our bill .
everything just took way too long!!
1 visit was enough .
unfortunately not going to be giving them another chance after 3 tries.
too bad since the food isn't bad but only had opportunity to try twice...
tried to have breakfast here this morning.
hope the corporation does something to remedy this.
it was disgusting!
ordered a meal for 4 people for delivery.
it is todays experience that got hcc (hobo camper country) this review.
i needed a side vent cover for a tent trailer.
the explanation was mastercard charges them for the sale and refund.
i'm sure hcc may have provided good sales and service to someone (not me).
i expected more for the price i paid.
yes, it's a buffet.
but this was far from what i had expected.
the food selections were average, errr...
actually a little below standard to me.
the taste were just plain.
the crab legs were dry and not moist a all.
i would not come back for sure.
she even put me on hold to check the wait time...
next time i am skipping eat n park and going to bj's.
they didn't look like they were cleaned at all.
so, my recommendation is to call someone else.
lots of carpet companies out there.
i love burger king but this location always messes up orders.
make sure you double check it before getting home.
out of 5 trips, telling them no cheese 4 times they put it on.
i watched two people get there food before me that ordered after i did.
the cashier, which i think is the manager zach?
the inner chicken breast meat was even cold to touch.
it seems as it was grilled the day before.
the same thing with the ribs ,very dry and tough and cold.
if your not a 21 year old looking to hook up, then run.
avoid this place...prices seem amazing but they don't tell you about the fees..
this place is a rip off...unless it's written in stone beware of this place.
customer service is horrible, management doesn't try to help at all.
he didn't remove all of the gel and then nipped at my cuticles haphazardly.
if i could give them zero stars i would!!!
the food here is great, but the service is terrible.
well, we gave it another try and again...terrible service.
they had the lowest prices available.
plus when they replaced my radiator, they ensured me i didn't need new hoses.
two months later, my hoses blew off and my car started smoking.
overall, frustrated experience.
my parents have had protection one for many years at their home and businesses.
have always loved their smoothies.
never been much of a fan of the food....rather flavorless.
the staff is primarily incompetent and aloof.
today, they were rude to my daughter...and then to me.
probably a safe bet that we will not be returning.
there was a sticker in my food.
restaurant was busy, had a long wait even though there were several empty tables.
waitress was friendly, but very very busy.
no drink refills were given in this time either.
in my omlette!
will likely not be back.
ordered a chicken quesadilla and it had a bone in the chicken still.
are you freaking kidding me?!
love the food.
hate the service.
had a party of 5.
was told they won't put tables together.
i said - i'll take a table at bar louie 10 feet away.
they have md-80s .
extra seats were added to increase profits.
all the seats in the cabin do not recline.
there are baggage fees.
for fun, check their on-time performance history.
http://www.flightstats.com/go/airline/airlinescorecard.do;jsessionid=a03abef5892708ca6d1a0bbe9f53ae95.web2:8009?airlinecode=g4  do you think that their competitive prices will make your travel experience better?
they r jerkoffs!
obviously someone had previously returned this item because they hassled me like a thief.
i'm like i don't care what u say stop insinuating that i stole it!
like i have nothing better to do than return shit at marshall's.
they lost a weekly customer
one of the worst poke bowls i've had.
very little rice, fish.
the sesame sauce was good but overall it was extremely disappointing.
great place with modern menu, they're not as flexible on menu alterations!
thru charge xtra for everything now..
it's always a problem here..
so we took out business somewhere else!
as a business owner myself i just don't understand it..
updating my last review.
finally got to speak to someone in dr bradford group.
not good at all, very little variety.
salad was wilted, nothing for my kids to eat.
would not recommend
(wonderful choices right?) the price of the tire is less than $120.
for one freaking tire change.
this is a neighborhood dive bar.
there is no real parking lot.
smoking is allowed.
it is located in the middle of a residential area.
i entered and sat down at the bar.
no one was behind the bar.
after waiting 5 minutes and not being served, i left.
we just got two larges and it was $25!!
i mean really?!
what sundae is worth $12.50?
i think i can get a cheesecake factory cheesecake for less than that!!
i knew this place was overpriced but jeez!
this place is horrible at appointment times.
i asked why and he replied you'll need to fill out paperwork.
(2 very short papers which takes less then 3 mins) still didn't sound right.
i was so hopeful about this place until the absolute last minute.
no response still.
oops sorrycame in on friday night to purchase a firearm.
to late for the background check.
i said excuse me but its only 219.
they had pulled the wrong gun the night before was there excuse.
big corporate stores nobody really cares.
please buy from small business's
ok so june 17,2016 i went on a date with my girlfriend.
she chose this restaurant she never been there before.
so we get there and we have my vehicle valet parking.
why would i do that an it would cost more?
but how i ask?
i don't know but guess who won't be eating here ever again.
also ordered a fresh squeezed juice.
sandwich was the size of my hand, finished it in 6 bites.
for $20, make your own damn grilled cheese.
the service was horrible.
we asked many times and they didn't tell us they didn't have the paper.
will never go back again and wont recommend to anyone.
in the interest of time, i moved forward.
then came the alignment scam.
what an overpriced, scam.
first time i went there had a great experience.
the owner did my nails and did a great job.
never going back
they moved us and stold a lot of my  stuff!!!!
the worst movers ever don't trustthem they have sticky fingers!!!!!!!!!!!!!
this tim hortons is the worst i've ever been to.
first things first, i took the time to walk there.
i ordered a steeped tea only to get a coffee instead.
and then ordered timbits only to find out they were stale.
so i ended up walking back and switching the coffee to the tea...
and got a refund for the timbits.
never again will i go to this tim hortons.
at this location a waitress named kristin was very rude.
very unprofessional treatment today.
i'd recommend finding another place that values their customers.
there are lots of them here in the burgh!
i guess being 5o and working the night shift says a lot about someone.
he was so rude.
i mean customer service is just not his thing.
never called back and i'm never going back.
rip off rip off alert..
cost 418 with insurance still have the rash..
i want to at least warn people if nothing else comes of this..
they are charging so much and did nothing for me..
and i think many doctors are charging themselves out of a  job..
go to naturopaths or chiropracters ..
well that would be my advise..
or at least family practice..
bagels are steamed therefore, mushy...reminded me of eating play-do.
you'd think they would toast for those who want toasting.
however, it fails me how many businesses prefer to not make money.
after my second experience with the rude owner of this establishment,.
i will not be back, buh-bye
ordered take-out/delivery for lunch and was less than satisfied.
the veggies on top weren't great quality either.
on top of that, the chicken was missing on top.
if i could give this rating a 0 or a negative rating i would.
with the lack of customer service that they have, i would never go back.
i ordered the wrong tea and they were very rude giving me another drink.
they didn't even give me my money back.
not going again.
i ordered the spicy watermelon.
it was so salty that i couldn't even drink it.
the drink was absolutely disgusting and not work the $6.25 i paid for it.
not worth the 45 minute drive from north las vegas.
learn to make a better "spicy watermelon" drink @zero degrees!
i stopped for lunch.
had the shrimp.
it tasted raw.
hoping i wouldn't be sick.
maybe their dim sum is better.
won't go again.
worst experience ever!
joy wouldn't even come from the back to talk to us.
what an experience.
this review is more on management than food or anything regarding the chain.
although i can imagine this establishment is not the only one doing this.
okay no big deal, i'll just call and return them tomorrow.
i invited my girlfriend and drove all the way out there for no reason.
i waited as she served 3 more customers and still no one came.
finally someone did show up and she finished my sale.
however this it where it gets worse.
after paying,  she shoved the receipt at me, and gave me another dirty look.
you could see a mist of windex landing onto all the meat.
what a bunch of douchebags.
first took me one hour with only 4 people in front of me.
i will never, ever ever rent from these bastards again.
do yourself a favor and run.
i only gave it one star because of the great car itself.
there is a long line at l'aveneue so we come here instead.
it turns out a bad choice.
bad service and we are not into the food.
won't come back again.
was served a bread basket with refrigerated bread.
had to ask the waiter for bread that was room temperature.
ordered the lobster bisque, worst lobster bisque ever.
tasted as i imagine dirty dish water with fish heads would taste.
management took the cost of the bisque off the ticket.
i had the lamb and it was bland and severely over salted.
the cauliflower was charred beyond recognition.
we decided to cut our losses and did not order dessert.
wait staff was not attentive.
be wise and spend your money elsewhere!
he had to personally bring our food over for something to be done.
don't come here.
horrible service, horrible food.
the food tasted horrible!
the beef taco carbon or whatever was horrible don't get it.
the pancho nachos suck.
the only good thing is the salsa and the creamy jalapeo.
my one star is for the staff only.
i have no problem with either dr pierrend or dr yonan.
currently looking for another office to take my dad.
nordstrom scottsdale fashion square cosmetic counter.
that has never happened to me in any store let alone nordstrom!
i actually have to make my purchase on amazon or sephora now!
she did not represent nordstrom as we know it!
terrible experience !
and i left without buying the shoes i came for.
i have tried several times to love this car wash.
this time was the worst my car has ever been.
half the vehicle wasn't even vacuumed.
they didn't open the trunk on my suv to clean at all like typically.
windshield is still dirty cup holders dirty...
heading home to rewash myself.
this place is a joke!!
horrible food loaded with msg !
horrible service ....
roaches crawling eeewwwww
just a thought....
but it might be a good idea to add hours of operation.
food backed up at the window,  or not done properly.
we come here all the time but not anymore.
too many screw ups and lousy service.
they used to be good but their standards have slipped big time
terrible service by armina  (i believe that's the name of the blonde cashier).
she needs to hide her attitude even if a customer has one.
no enthusiasm, feels like she doesn't want to be here.
again, the place was not even busy!
the place was empty something must be going on.
the food they served us was cold.
the only think that almost burned my mouth was the chicken nuggets.
we asked them to remake the food.
this time, the fries and nuggets were hit, but burgers still cold.
fresh doesn't mean heated to the proper temperature.
there was maybe 5 people in the whole store, you can produce hot food.
this location did not.
ce fut aujourd'hui une exprience dcevante.
le seul point positif est notre serveur, claude, qui est gentil et efficace.
quand les clients dsertent, le message est clair .
c'est triste mais pour moi, arahova, c'est termin.
the store was crowded people are waiting no help.
it was a horrible experience.
the customs are bad quality and expensive.
not worth it and never come back.
lastly the bagels are very expensive  so recommendation to find another place!
will be a very long time before we return....lost a few loyal customers tonight.
tues.oct 20th,8:30 pm.
my mistake for not using yelp when booking this company.
i only search using google.
they are ripoff artist.
charged extra to have dancer on the party bus.
first off, i got my keys on the 24th of this month.
they never cleaned out the apartment what so ever.
i found rat poop all over the closet.
bartender's attitude, an entirely different matter.
who deserves such nasty treatment?
hope the owner reads this.
poor return policy!!!
giving me pennies on the dollar for what i paid.
how insulting that a manager would rip off a customer this badly.
people move and loose receipts.
ended up leaving the pictures in the store and walking out.
poor customer service!!!!!
i was extremely disappointed and disgusted by the corruption that is allowed in drai's.
i mean really??
the waitress took forever to take our order.
we got to the restaurant at 7pm...we didn't get any water until 7:45pm.
after requesting for water on three separate occasions, we still did not get them.
we had to ask another waiter to get us some water.
although, the service was lacking the food was decent.
it's a crap shoot with allegiant, whose ticket costs fluctuate from hour to hour.
need i say more?
and then they would get one chance.
this store sucks.
management needs to get the sales clerks all on the same page.
what can i buy for 10 motherfuckin cents???
the worst geek squad i've ever seen.
smelly, unhelpful, rude employees.
not worth the hassle
closest thing to easting in a washroom you'll find.
came here on a saturday night.
our appetizers took 45 minutes to arrive.
- none of the food was brought out at the same time.
everyone ate separately while the others watched - average food and we'll overpriced.
- ambiance was that of a prison washroom.
would not recommend nor will i step foot in this dump again.
worse place in las vegas for product, quality, availability or customer service.
very rarely go anymore, always disappointed with lack of purchases when we do.
where to start.
the food was below average and cold and not cheap.
denny's quality with gourmet prices...no thank you.
nor do the companies that give out the passes .
this is the worst hotel i have ever been to.
they are liars and have inflicted unnecessary charges.
they have damaged my car.
i said you know what,  never mind.
and my kids and i walked out.
only giving 1 star due to the kindness of the girl at the register.
probably the worst service experience ever!
my friend's wife ordered a glass of wine which had a fly in it.
i should have read the yelp reviews first.
the nail tech i don't think knew what she was doing..
i had her stop in the middle of service and i walked out horrible.
and never again
you don't pay you don't get your truck, and hang up the phone....
tracy rude as well hang up the phone..
i initiated an investigation in the meantime stay away from these thieves...
first and last time here.
the food was horrible, it was like frozen food.
in my opinion, there was not much of a selection.
cashier's name ruby should not deserve to be as cashier because of her attitude.
she yells at customer and not going back there for this reason.
bacchanal way better.
hygienist rude and unprofessional!
i will not step foot in this office again!
be really careful when you decide to go there.
sashimi wasn't cut correctly and all fish had a funny flavor.
the tuna was pink instead of red.
i'm honestly a little worried about food poisoning.
there are so many better places to eat sushi.
pick somewhere else.
the price is too high for such low quality.
my dining partner couldn't even eat her taco salad.
salad was wilted and the beef was way too salty.
after we complained service pretty much stopped after we complained.
i am very disappointed for i liked this place and it has some charm.
not sure what is going on but it sure has changed.
also noticed not as many customers as before.
i did not eat here.
because the service was so poor.
i went to the bar.
sat there for about 5 to 10 min.
the persons behind the bar.
than went back to the other end of the bar to grab a bill.
at 6ft 200lb it was the first time i felt invisible.
do yourself a favor and go to another kinkos location.
this one is the absolute worst i've ever encountered across the country.
slow is an understatement.
they are under staffed and they don't care at all.
i waited 25 minutes for 5 pages of black and white text to print.
there was literally not one person in there when i walked in.
in that moment, they were over staffed and still didnt care.
consider yourself warned.
they consistently say one thing and then do the opposite!
they think by saying over and over again "im so sorry" fixes the problem.
last months delivery was 4 hours late and the man was really rude!
the store itself is okay, but don't go here for a gel manicure.
finally, the final product looked really bad.
i'm going to have to either fix it or just take it off myself.
next time i will just go to another salon in the area.
called and set up an appointment for an estimate.
the time scheduled was 2pm.
saturday morning i left early to go help someone with an eagle project.
i rushed home to make sure i was there at 2.
i got home at 1:30.
they told me my car had a lot of loose stabilizing parts.
i installed all of those parts myself, they were not loose.
i went in for a tranny seal replacement.
they did fix the seal, but they also messed up my alignment...
what kind of repair shop breaks something, trying to replace another?
worst pineapple fried rice i've ever eaten.
literally just tastes like plain white rice.
and it had raisins in it??
safe to say i probably won't be back here.
came in to get contacts & glasses prescription renewed.
booked appointment, arrived on time...60 min wait....
they forgot to measure my eyes for contacts.
came in a few days later...another hour wait time.
the oakley glasses i purchased were $50 cheaper online.
paid the $25 for expedited shipping...
4 days later the glasses arrived.
so yeah, you deserve less than 1 star.
you would have called to tell me that you don't actually deliver downtown.
in summary: don't order delivery if you live in an apartment building.
i left when i noticed the utensils were not wrapped in a napkin..
just sitting there on the table..
screw this place !!
we had a water line leak, where the driveway had to be torn up.
louie charged us $145 to tell us that.
we called office and asked mgr to return our call....nothing.
i would not recommed them for anything but cleaning drains!!!!
they lost a $4,000 job.
highly recommend these guys.
customer in shadow run subdivision, henderson, nv
stopped by the bar for a drink after dinner (elsewhere) on april 19.
initial service was great.
a little slow with the bill.
i did not leave that.
i left a message on black and bleu phone and got no response.
update:  lexie worked with me to credit my card $15.00.
$13 for 2 cheeseburgers, fries and a drink.
management doesn't teach this?
they just lost a customer.
my wife and baby daughter came here right at 5pm when they opened.
the place was practically empty.
they asked if we had reservations, and we said no.
we would be done eating by the time those people came.
thanks for ruining my wife's first early mother's day dinner!
first of all, i couldn't hear her through the speaker.
and there was a hair on my food.
in addition, management did not try to take care of customers.
they could (at least) offer free refuel service for the inconvenience.
**hertz, you have to overlook your establishment in las vegas.
it is degrading your brand name.**
i ordered the spring rolls.
am a still feeling dehydrated.
will not support this local eatery again.
this location i am currently sitting in is super super hot!
it's nicer outside then it is inside!
personal opinion this is crazy!
it's unbearable to even sit.
not coming here again.
place sucks and is no way fast food.
nothing better than waiting inside and watching six drive-thru orders get filled before yours.
also love how they charge, .85 for extra condiments!
will drive extra distance to another location and try them out.
on may 22, 2014 i agreed to rent a small car for 3 days.
every question i asked she lied about costing me an additional $245.75.
please be careful when renting from this company, they will drain your bank account.
get a thrill out of finding foreign objects in your food?
then bol d'or is the place for you!
today, i found a strip of metal in my soupe aigre-piquant.
i won't be eating here again; it's simply too dangerous.
this was our worst experience with a kfc yet!
3 workers sitting in booths on their phones.
we should have left.
actually they don't deserve a 1 star!
don't go there!!!!!
wasn't offered pickles/onions so had to ask, should not have had to!
taste is decent but not impressed much and employees had heads up asses.
the tires did look good.
thanks for screwing up my daughter's senior prom.
the lady there accepted the job then failed to show up.
this is totally unacceptable.
you folks really suck.
hope you go out of business.
thanks for ignoring our dozen or so calls trying to reach you.
if i could give them less then this i would.
i walked around and was looking for a salon to get a mani/pedi.
i yelped a few and came across uno salon.
i called and they could get me in right away.
what an ignorant thing to say!
my experience was pretty bad.
i had a service call on a ge washer.
on top of that he said it would cost $420!
we got it the new motor the day after we ordered it.
thankfully my daughters boyfriend installed the new motor and the machine is running great.
sorry i spent $65 for a service call.
i won't use them again.
i guess other people don't make a fuss about paying it.
my husband is tall so we always volunteer to sit there.
i was told well there is more room thats why we charge extra.
ok lets see if this gets any better i can only hope!
do not stay here!!
the rooms are old and nasty.
there is no parking and the valet was an ass!!!
we were so excited to try this place out.
we ordered the egg salad sandwich and the bacon, egg and cheese (no sauce).
i excepted the buns to be warm, although they were nice buns overall.
we got the pasta with red sauce and lemon chicken.
no flavor and super plain.
the staff were ok though.
this was the worst cut of my life.
i've had cuts i didn't love but this is not something anyone would want.
they said it's not that bad and i should let them fix it.
place is filthy.
it is always something missing.
the ticket is correct but the bag never has the correct contents.
they outta fire the lot of them including the manager!
contractor missed first estimate appointment.
he randomly showed up the next day when no one was home.
never actually sent the estimate and didn't respond to calls.
i guess a few thousand worth of work isn't enough to merit his time.
why was everything swimming in oil?!
ordered an egg dish and couldn't eat it because it was so greasy!
also, the waffles are not waffles...
they're cookies with icing on them...
the only good thing was the poached pear.
but felt too guilty eating it cos my friends were suffering!
my burger was burnt and dried out and so were my two friends.
really got taken for a ride by the service dept.
first they charge $125 per issue for inspection.
my traction control on my certified pre owned odyssey was not functioning.
also the tpms light was on.
they wanted $250 just to inspect both issues see.
it told them not to check the tpms too much.
they charged me $202 and did not fix either issue.
complete rip off.
never going back
horrible customer service!
asked for a meat and cheese steak no onions.
don't make the sandwich you want make the sandwich the customer wants.
don't eat here!!!
worst car rental experience ever, would give.
i license plate which is super shady.
horrible service from dr anderson.
he was assuming my dog had parvo!
which may be causing the symptoms????
he said no doctor can answer that!!
ask for a vet with experience....not just anybody!
clearly, a restaurant destined to close if they don't get it together.
no attention to detail either.
this place looked pretty good until we talked to our server.
she was rude.
we had to take the bill up ourselves to pay.
this place makes ohio seem like los angeles.
they might want to update their hours.
very disappointing especially since it was pouring when this attempt was made.
only received one star since it forces you to give it a star.
this is a review of the time we didn't get in.
they even had a little sign drawn that said 'closed for jay-z'.
the bouncer was friendly enough but i couldn't sweet talk my way in.
i'm guessing no but then who was there?!
very bad service..
still waited for over an hour after my set check in time.
very unfriendly service.
when i asked how much longer i have to wait they called me i.
and put me in examining room and left me waiting longer.
sandwiches taste great but it's 50% more expensive than planet hollywood location.
bottled water is 5$.
for true experience go to earl of sandwich in planet hollywood
she treated me as if i was the dumbest person she has ever met.
hopefully she doesn't last long or they will lose customers.
the service is so bad as is the food.
the manager could care less.
the waitress lost our credit card but delivered the check and never told us.
it took 28 mins to get check and we were late for event.
response to company: as scotty l.
poor customer service.
she expect you to put the basket away for her.
find another dollar tree to shop at.
i rarely go to the doctor and visiting this practice reminded me why.
i came in because i've been having trouble sleeping.
i made an appointment with kate montgomery , rn, cs, fnp.
all i can say is wow, i've never felt so judged in my life!
she was down right rude!
i will finding another doctor that is not so judgmental.
if i were you, i would pass on this facility.
food and coffee are good but my order is often wrong.
at first they forgot to include the sandwich.
i came to the restaurant because guy fieri is one of my favorite chefs.
for a burger and a salad along with 2 alcoholic beverages is was $67.
this place is over priced and tastes like canned pasta.
the only thing edible was the bread and bottles beers.
i'll keep this simple: do not rent from budget at phoenix sky harbor airport!!!!
our dinner at the mgm grand buffet was horrible.
for $40 per person you think they would offer something that tastes good.
everything we tried lacked flavor, even the crab.
i've never had crab legs that were absolutely flavorless.
the desserts were ok, but why pay $40 per person for dessert.
my insurance company set up my tow with this company.
i also let state farm know.
this place has bad customer sevice.
it's common sense you know?" when he told me that, i blew up.
not to mention i'm spending my damn money at your restaurant!
i don't appreciate that and he could of just kept his mouth shut.
all he had to say was no and i would have accepted that.
what happened to the paying customer being right??
i tried their full set "sexy" eyelash service with annie last week.
the type of glue used in this place does not agree with my eyes.
also, the style asked for was not what i ended up with.
i would not recommend this eyelash location to anyone.
i love guy fieri's....
i took my husband to his restaurant in vegas i was very surprised...
this establishment closed in december.
there is a note on the door.
please don't waste your gas driving to mesa jambo!
the phoenix site was fine.
i ate here once...
probably won't repeat.
reminds me of the old style gas stay ion burritos.
i definitely was not impressed.
i do not see the place lasting
i have no idea how they still manage to stay in business.
we were told to expect a service person between 4-7 pm.
we had no one show up and no one call to cancel or reschedule.
very upset  at the poor customer service.
had them out for a second opinion/quote to see what was out there.
didn't actually sample any product.
the sales rep, steve, was just a jerk.
just felt sleazy.
their prices were $.50 to $1.00 higher per sqft than the next closest competition.
didn't even get close to looking at product based on the initial sticker shock.
i would stay away, go somewhere else with more honest people.
we ordered food from here and it was a real disappointment.
the lobster was dry and overdone.
i would never order from here again.
the prices were way too high for the quality of food presented.
i explained the situation to one of the girls at the front desk.
store is nice but the customer service leaves a lot to be desired.
would give 0 stars if possible.
very disappointed in the turkey croissant today.
it had very little turkey, two tiny wilted pieces of lettuce.
kid is rude!
food is good but prices a little higher than usual food trucks.
my husband and i just can't deal with the kid taking orders.
we feel like an inconvenience.
too bad they don't read these reviews to address the customer service issue.
i'll take my business to viva mexican grill!
their food is actually pretty good, but a pretty limited menu, burgers and wraps.
if it's the not so good folks, forget about it.
what are these people talking about?!
the filling was bitter.
my bf said it tasted burnt.
don't waste your money.
this was the first time i've thrown macarons away.
but never again.
this is our last time coming.
they let us order all you can eat then closed the kitchen.
no cooked food.no a/c no fan.
fine you are messing with the electricity.....
but why on a saturday night at 9:30?????
like the raven....nevermore.
this is the absolute worst car rental company.
the customer service was shitty!
ahmed in particular was extremely rude, pushy, slow and unprofessional.
i will never rent from you again based on this experience.
i ordered kung pao shrimp to go and got stale chicken.
also ordered tofu family style which was over cooked
hello fellow yelpers,i apologize in advance for the length of this review.
that stops now.
goodbye dc...i was a major advocate for you...no longer.
i was hoping donna's bakery will be the bakery to fill the need.
sadly it was not up to expectation for an asian style cake with fruits.
there goes my hope of finding a good chinese bakery !!
recently bought a used car from this dealership.
great car, but deceptive finance dept.
be careful with giuseppe, this guy is not up-front with what he is doing.
i was duped and can't believe it....my bad.
team and dealership is polished on the outside, shady and dirty on the inside!
they have definitely lost a future customer....
the customer service in this sephora location is almost always terrible.
some of the employees are so rude and condescending!
with an attitude told the cashier to give me my money back.
this is just one of several examples.
their manager should do something about it.
buying cosmetics should not be an unpleasant experience.
dirty restrooms and slow unatentive bartenders.
:-(  who runs this place .
no toilet paper.
this is some bullshit
the spring rolls were cold.
they also charged me $7 for delivery, i live less than 2 blocks away.
the one star is for her attitude.
maybe she should read yelp and get her act together.
i'd advise that one if you want good, polite service.
the chocolate chocolate chip cake is awesome.
and the red velvet is above decent, also.
prices are high, but worth it in taste.
the food is 4.5 stars for sure.
they were a 5 star until they closed and didn't notify me.
if anyone intercepts my mail please forward i'd appreciate it:(
the worse service ever.
outside garbage everywhere and even some cupcakes laying on the floor.
stood in line 10 minutes without being acknowledged.
will never step foot there again
we had a small issue which could have been resolved with an email.
stay at the sheraton across the street.
ok here's the sernerio ..
there out of sweet potato fries, salsa for the chips sweet tea...
can u believe that...
our server seemed to have her mind somewhere else hard to get ketchup here...
cold slaw needs major work..
hard to give a tip here..
it's like a honeycomb pattern of hyper and hypo pigmentation.
thank you guys for ruining my legs
i am about ready to sue for my $260
what a terrible place.
they scrimped on all ingredients.
i will never order fromhere again.
there are other chinese restaurants that are actually great quality.
wedding cake - extremely poorly executed.
service - non existent.
recommendation - never.
unfortunately this location serves you ice cold meals.
that is all.
this place is disgusting--no black light needed to illuminate the extent of filth.
worst in town!
today, the store was about 60% stocked.
they were out  or do not carry almost everything i was looking for.
target, here i come!
please do not get the pork bone soup.
it's advertised that it came with potato, but it was not in the soup.
10 minutes later, our potato cake out.
the food was not that great.
update: just tried the potato, it's actually a taro!!
talk about nickel and diming!
(not to mention sales tax fraud ...
i would stay and shop longer if it wasn't so hot in this store.
it's phoenix, please cool down your store.
it's unreliable to have what you want in stock.
wish i could love target as much as i want to.
they were good before several years ago!
i ended up spent $1000+ for  nothing.
it's unfair and they had no consideration for others.
please stay away from this loan company !!
bad quality nails in the first place.
when i asked for a back fill.
that "enhancement fee" is bogus, try budgeting monthly membership fees for upkeep and maintainance.
i'm so glad yelp was there to help me decide.
i'm definitely not returning to mountainside gym.
save your money, the lunch special bbq pork was terrible.
the fried rice was brown with onions in it.
if i could give 0 stars i would.
honesty, i only receive late packages from amazon prime when ontrac is used.
i live in an apartment complex and the packages are never delivered on time.
the excuse today was that the "business was closed".
thats hilarious because the complex does not close.
i was home all day and no attempt was made.
again this is not the first time.
i will avoid knowingly doing any business with this atrocious company.
amazon really needs to ditch these clowns.
i really hate that they give them business because they do not deserve it.
went in for a bouquet for a simple event.
browsed their selection in the case and everything available was insanely overpriced.
flowers were browning, small and some wilted.
would not recommend.
worst airline ever, gave them another chance.
they totally suck.
should be minus status...
if i could give negative stars i would!
ok, so yelp is requiring me to write more.
two minutes later they open the comfortable seating/table section.
ok enough said!
not going back again,urban = gangsta!
not well managed!
where do i begin ...
my friend's fried chicken burger's "fried skin" was burnt to a crisp ...
completely black ...
i hate giving bad reviews anywho  this b***h is flat out rude.
will never return!!
i went for a simple repair.
i don't know what they did but they ruined my bumper sticker.
they insist its not their fault, that's ridiculous.
the window was fine when i brought the car to the shop.
i will never go back.
the food is good, but the staff is not.
the service was absolutely horrible.
food is usually good, but since the service was bad, it lessened my experience.
first time trying this restaurant.
it's pretty bad, expensive and the dishes taste like plastic.
a last resort only, well, maybe you're better off with convenience store snacks instead.
salads are garnished with all types of peppers not mentioned on the menu.
caesar is laughable.
design your own pasta was warmed up pasta with a bland sauce.
crispy crust on the pizza was anything but.
i purchased two appliances 5 years ago with an extended warranty.
i asked him repeatedly if it would be a full refund.
he insisted that i would receive the full warranty cost back if no claims.
this week i called to have my full refund returned.
the director of operations for ontario would not honour the full refund.
do not go here.
hours are not accurate.
i would give zero stars if possible.
always a mad house!
found scheduling an appointment to be pointless.
hate dealing with apple
finally a new breakfast place!
but oh, the disappointment...
hostesses dressed like nightclub cocktail waitresses at 8:00 in the morning?
super loud in the dining room.
and very exspensive for sub-par food.
progressive raised my rates.
switched to geico.
did save money.
i called progressive to dump them.
they said don't leave, we can give you a better rate.
should have given me the best rate in the first place.
almost 20 years with them.
this place is so over rated, it deserve a one star on yelp..
not from michelin....
not to mention..
the kumamoto oyster was so petite...
very disappointing dinner...
i will be cancelling both vehicles and our home insurance from this company.
horrible follow up and they flat out lied..
i'm wondering how this is a "smash hit"?
if you have to check it out go to goldstar.com..
you can get discount tickets there.
save your money!
the food is disgusting.
they were rude, confrontational, and their overall bitchy attitudes made our group quite uncomfortable.
i left hungry and upset because i felt ripped off.
just awful, awful, awful.
i've lived all over this country.
literally coast to coast, and suxcox has the worst service i've ever seen.
in fact, i don't know how they remain in business.
sheesh, i thought comcast was bad.
turns out i was spoiled!!
health department should review this place!!!
it's not right at all.
tough sell here in arizona.
when i heard about the death metal comment.
blaming others etc.
godbless and good luck
manager mercedes is the worst manager for people that use coupons.
1 per purchase, means 1 per item!!
not 1 per transaction!!
she just hates couponers...
it's pretty pathetic but i won't argue there anymore.
they advised me to go to another target.
just visited tonight and will not return.
service iswonderful andpleasant but they only can serve wat they get.
i waned chardonnay and it was awful and sent it back.
atmosphere pleasant, cloth table cloths 2 sports tvs.soft music.
i stopped shopping here.
first of all, none of their clothing holds up...
the one star is based on the food.
so she ordered the irish breakfast and the egg yokes were solid.
i thought rasher came with the meal should've asked but there was no rasher.
this is a common component of an "irish" breakfast.
personally,  i would not come here for food ever again.
dont forget to use your local discount!!!
i just found out it would have been so much cheaper!!!
i was very disappointed because i had a high opinion of the restaurant.
i left feeling like i had just thrown $50 down the drain.
it would take a lot of convincing for us to try this restaurant again.
this restaurant is over priced and extremely shitty quality.
i ordered the cashew chicken (vegan) for 17$ and it was so bland.
my boyfriend still paid for it and i left hungry and upset.
i gave this place one stars because of the service i received.
the lady sees the logo of company my mom works for on her shirt.
we did not come here to be harassed while we wait for our food.
they need to teach their works about proper conversation with customers.
true it could have been just that one lady but it was completely unnecessary.
if this incident did not happen i would still be going here.
pho was excellent!
service was terrible!!!!
waiters looked unprofessional and uninterested in their customers.
never greeted upon arrival and no one ever checked in once my food arrived.
never got asked if i wanted a drink?!
i had to literally demand every service as they never initiated.
with the many pho restaurants out there i will take my $$$$ elsewhere!
thank you, your loss!
this company did the worst install job i have ever seen.
this new unit was working at 50%.
poor service, overpriced food.
make sure to check your dim sum bill.
they tried cheating me and making things more expensive.
very dishonest business and would not go back.
it is a husband and wife business ron and jan.
however their flat bread breakfast sandwich is a disaster.
what a contrast to their amazing toasted sandwiches!
i will never make the mistake of having their breakfast sandwich ever again.
i took one look at their cold mini pre prepared omelette.
...and lost visual appetite.
totally lost my appetite after taking a bite.
the receptionist was extremely unorganized - she forgot to place my order.
no apologies were made.
bad attitude and terrible customer service.
i'm taking my business somewhere else.
i would not recommend this place to anyone.
act put out by any request.
overcharged me to cut a piece of wood i purchased in-store, then acted annoyed.
ordered at the drive thru, got home and an entire meal was missing.
my ice tea also had no ice in it.
but i got it and went home.
this store is off my list.
they need some work.
they obviously don't care much about their customers.
it was so long ago i was there i can't remember the service.
she explained that they had car trouble and that i would have to reschedule.
why is this my responsibility?
it was instant and i would not recommend using this company.
totally boring, i am glad my trip there was free.
i went here to get a security camera system.
i called before hand.
they said they hand it in stock.
when i got there they had one in stock and couldn't find it.
best buy had it in stock and price matched the sale price
i do not recommend this business to anyone.
i don't think they train their customer service employees at all!
i shouldn't have to call customer service so much.
it is plain old ridiculousness.
i will not get cox again in the future.
pink inside too.
the waitress was very nice about it and didn't charge us.
ended up leaving and going to another place for ribs....
moosehead's in olmstead falls is the best for ribs!!!
all of this for $12.00
tammy and her associate were so rude to my husband when shopping in there.
i guess young hispanic men can't buy $50 bottles.
it says they discover excessive dirt/sand in the interior of the car.
i see there could be some dirt underneath the mats but $175 for cleaning??
this was truly a major disappointment.
the restaurant is way over-priced and the food is just "average".
i had a steak and shrimp dish that was average.
shrimp was ok but the steak was tough and over cooked.
service was marginal yet the restaurant was not full.
very disappointed and would not recommend this to anyone.
walked into an empty shop and clearly heard everyone in the back groan.
"oh, great."then one complained about the type of sandwich he had to make.
i don't have a lot of tolerance immature sarcastic **%@#+/?!!
worst customer service.
it would have to be a balloon and not a piata..
what is the difference?
this place is terrible..
its an insult for us as well as for the angels that lay there.
its is usually called as the "picky cementery"
worst airline ever!
won't be going here anymore.
talk about crappy  customer service.
usually i'm a very laid back, easygoing customer and am very understanding of mishaps.
do not bother giving them your business, they clearly don't care about their customers!!!!!
i went to lifted trucks to obviously look for a truck.
i was very specific on what i wanted.
they didn't have anything on their lot that i liked.
i told the salesman that and he wouldn't let me leave.
super pushy and kept trying to sell me something i didn't want.
finally i just walked out on them in the middle of the salesman talking....
i would not recommend them to anyone.
overcharged after giving written guarantee.
wrote to president with complaint.
not even the courtesy to reply me.
i have managed a couple subway stores when i was younger.
this is not subway standards.
my stores never acted like this!!
these people were not friendly, organized or clean about anything.
owner is the most complete jerk you will ever encounter.
if you want to be disrespected and taken for granted, this is your place.
we ate, or tried to eat here tonight.
i ordered coffee and water.
the rolls came and my wifes was ok.
mine did not have the avocado in it.
no---no. we asked the server a question, he left and never came back,ever.
this attitude totally sucked.
this office is so disorganized and just unprofessional.
i have an auto-immune disease which requires monthly blood tests and daily meds.
i hate this place.
they would tell her that "it was suppose to hurt".
other hotels dont do that!
now onto the food, i've been here twice.
very slim pickings with cold dry food!
honestly the ti and luxor buffet is even better and luxor isnt good.
save your money and go to the aria buffet or wynn or ceasars.
bellagio is horrible now they've gone down hill.
the restaurant smells like an assisted living facility.
service is slow.
the menu seems overpriced, especially given the other  dining choices nearby.
you get nothing for the high price they charge you.
i live right up the street literally and i won't step foot in there.
they recommended i call at&t for service.
thank you joaquin rejon for getting me hooked up and in record time!!!!
sebastian was very rude and it was unwarranted.
came to the house quickly.
we were having systemic toilet clogging problems.
they could replace each toilet for an incredible $1648.00 each!!!!
and that was the super special deal.
a colossal waste of money and time!
do not call these jokesters!
good if you're a fan of precooked food or egg mcmuffin's.
i ordered their egg sandwich on a brioche bun.
hard egg and even stiffer bun.
nothing special here, i'd go somewhere else.
don't waste your money!!
keep in mind this was the owner!!
you work there everyday!!
it's people like you who give small business owners a bad rep.
my flight from the west coast was late getting into cleveland.
i called the marriott reservation number and spoke with nicole.
for $170 this was totally unacceptable.
food didn't sit well the next day at all!
de quoi vous dgoter  toujours.
on nous a rembours le cot du plat, mais est-ce suffisant ?
a mon avis, non.
after finishing our meals we headed out and we ended up getting food poisoning!!!
it was horrendous.
the place let me down.
i will never go back.
in my case, it was the insurance.
avoid this company if at all possible.
they are criminals and you should get your money back.
best of luck to you all.
refuge for authoritarian vegans of concordia that we pay with our tuition fees.
saw the fruits they were selling from a friend who decided to try.
old and on the verge of rotting.
like their organization.
unpleasant experience before work was even done.
their website to book appointments doesn't function.
there's no indication of this on the website.
what's the point of even having it?
this is not a great first impression.
giving this experience 1 star is being generous.
may i suggest choosing sam's club or costco to purchase furniture?
they sell for mor better quality for mor less :)  ...
as of 4/2018  furniture is just getting worse and worse.
leather is peeling despite our best efforts to rarely use this furniture.
because at least they will stand by what they sell.
"oh my god, where do i begin?
first off, the dance floor is gross!
i don't know what other days are like, but that day sucked!
when we walked in the place was empty and it was self seating.
so we walked around trying to find a clean table!
they were all filthy.
also the bathrooms were horrendous!!!!
i will never return.
come on gold spike you can do better than that.
they should change their name to un-dependable or definitely un-reliable.
we had such a bad experience with them.
from the date of delivery to customer service.
if you're thinking of doing business with this group-don't.
can't do business and treat customers this way.
i understand being busy but worst place ever.
first asked for lemon 3 times for water.
never refilled the water.
as a server you should notice food not out for 45 minutes.
nothing was offered to make up for this and they just let us leave.
no apologies or anything.
very disappointed and will not ever be back.
i continue to give them a chance simply because it is convenient.
the owner mistreats and demeans his employees.
he is cruel and heartless.
shame on you frank huang you need to learn some human kindness.
thought they were joking.
walked in and there was a woman waiting to be seated before us.
looked around and noticed that just about every table was not cleared.
so i just stopped by this sonic and ordered a ice cream sundae.
i waited what seemed to be forever just to have my order taken.
i asked him what's this?
can i have a spoon?
and he tells me that they ran out of spoons..
how can a drive up ice cream place not have any spoons?
go to wal mart, it's two blocks away and buy some spoons.
i seriously don't know about these other reviews, but this steakhouse was awful!
i've had better food at saltgrass.
i had the filet mignon and my date had the ribeye.
but this was terrible - almost ruined my night.
the service was exceptional but the food was revolting.
mold on the tortilla                                                                                                                                      make sure to check your food for rot.
we came here based on the yelp reviews....we were disappointed.
i moved from pittsburgh to miami.
they were rude and do not run on schedule.
keep a safe distance if you like your items.
"dun wrong."  terrible workmanship, to the point of being unsafe.
passenger door didn't close properly.
took 4 attempts to sort everything out.
the hostile attitude didn't exactly help things either.
i had refilled around the corner and returned the car immediately after refueling.
i am flabbergasted that such a mistake could be made.
maybe not a mistake i wonder.
food has progressed and changed.
this is a tourist trap before weekend baseball games, that's it.
go with all the negative reviews!!
you know all those 60 minute episodes investigating scam techs and service companies??
these techs fall in that category of scam service techs.
stay away from them!!
worst steak shawarma ever.
plus they packaged salad with hot dish  salad was wilted.
not interested in going back.
a half hour wait for a sandwich to be served.
so why are they in the restaurant business?
the food was mediocre and crazy expensive.
i will be eating there never!
there is no depth beyond the bar, and the kitchen is sub-par.
how do i know?
i had a view, and what i witnessed was a zoo.
servers running in and out with empty trays and pursed-lipped mouths.
empty glasses, cold-served food and frazzled waiters dodging you.
if there's a place i'd recommend, give ear to me my famished friend.
get up from here and move your feet to any other on this street.
'cause life's to short to waste your time,just ask me, i wasted mine!
as soon as i walk in i notice the lack and laziness there.
as she started to brush my hair i stand up and told her.
i'm going somewhere else.
i don't know understand how's this business is till open.
great customer service when setting up and receiving containers.
i love this salon in other locations but not the one here.
this is probably the worst place in all of downtown.
there are plenty of other great dance clubs and trendy bars in the area.
do not waste your time here!
(hint: the service is non-existent)
the potential is there...they just haven't reached a high point, or middle point yet.
but salt does not make a bad meal better.
won't ever go here.
what a rip off.
quality isn't even that great.
i'm never going back
service here was terrible.
i mean this is a sushi place right!!!!!
negative experience, the customer service was uncomfortable from the start.
won't recommend this place to anyone nor will i be back here
definitely the worst haircut experience i've ever had.
i did a walk in and got a gentlemen by the name of vitaly.
he then tells me i have bad skin.
do not come here.
service was bad, food was average, and totally kid unfriendly!
i don't recommend.
so many other great restaurants in chagrin falls...we won't go to this place again!!
good bye, yellow cab.
my family and i thought we would try this place out bad idea.
i dont recommend this place.
last but not least we all had an upset stomach the following day.
dont waste your time!
small, empty, a little sketchy getting to, and no stadium seating.
once you get in they have limited selection of food for the movie.
why does amazon.com continue to contract with this company?
they are destroying the amazon.com brand one delivery at a time.
a few occasions packages have arrived well after 8:00.
in one instance the package arrived after 11:00pm.
all the more reason amazon.com should kill their contract with ontrack.
overall, this is an okay hardware store, even though the selection is limited.
service is generally not helpful, but not a major flaw.
i recently purchased a schlage deadbolt from the home hardware at 290 college street.
this location is a sad joke.
this is the worst place ever!!!
our waitress was a complete a-hole!!!!
the young guy changing out the coals was nice enough to take our order.
never going back!!
this all went down @ the charleston location
i ordered a las vegas roll.....very disappointed!
poor flavor & extremely small to what they used to be.
needless to say.....will never go back!!!!
sura korean bbq is still the best....
very slow service...
they need to hire more servers...
$25.99 dinner menu b all you can eat per person is quite expensive ...
dirty, nasty, and tacky!
we had wings there which literally glowed under the "awesome" black lights.
we call them snot wings.
there are plenty o'dive bars out there which are good and good for ya.
this is not one of them.
worst mcdonald's i've ever been to.
i would also give a zero if i could.
i paid $54 dollars for my nails to not even last three days.
do not spend your money here
placed an order with 3 small children and 4 adults.
terrible food--- this past weekend i ordered the gnocchi & lobster ravioli.
the gnocchi itself was $20!
that doesn't include seafood or any meat.
i couldn't even take two bites out of the entree.
it's hard to go wrong with gnocchi (it's my fave).
the lobster ravioli was ok, but i'll warn you...
it's super duper salty.
what a disappointment!!!
please don't spend your money where they are so very un- generous.
the owner, he is not gracious.
support somewhere led by someone who cares for you while taking cash only.
the hype got to their heads, because the obnoxious service got even more awful.
we made a reservation and were kept cooling our heels for an hour.
this is pittsburgh, friend.
at the end of the day, you're still in a third rate town.
lose the attitude.
the food was mediocre.
what a waste.
this place stinks!!!!
it has seriously gone down hill.
dirty plates and tables everywhere.
you only get one breadstick unless you ask for more.
don't waste your time
called over five times throughout the day to make an appointment.
get someone to answer your phone and learn to accommodate people.
that was my first and last time in there.
it was probably a blessing in disguise i didn't get my kid's haircut there.
it looked dirty.
go elsewhere and support businesses that care about their customers!!
do not come here.
it took over one hour to get the meal and appetizers,.
to make up, the manager offered only 25% off and for us a desert.
worst service ever ...
you have to be a single man to be treated right ...
sad :(never coming to this location again ...
or maybe hooters in general
the place is new, so with the staff.
very slow service.
every step the staff will ask someone he she can do this or that.
cashier staff can't even print a receipt.
advantage only receives one star because the return process went smoothly.
the same can't be said for the rental process.
me thinks a recommendation for advantage is out of the question.
by the way a baileys and coffee is 11.50 in case you were wondering.
terrible country music covers.
never again will i go there.
no wonder the monte carlo is 2.5 star rated.
these guys are dirt bags, don't rent a car from here.
they then shut off the lights and machines and we left.
there are other stores with far better customer service.
all of the review left so far are accurate.
save the hassle and go to san marbeya  next door.
i stopped by at excacly 6:37 pm and the place was closed ...
two employees inside cleaning but closed...
no business hour posted anywhere in the business ...
soooo im disgusted by the way i revieved my drunk!!!
you put a dirty can of pop ontop my ice iny cup!!
i would rate this company zero stars if i could.
need to get in touch with the owner?
this company is a joke!
terrible environment for a "relaxing" spa day.
needless to say i won't go back and do not recommend this place.
i had the worst haircut of my life at this salon.
i was so disappointed that i rushed to another salon to get it fixed.
please avoid this place - don't support such a shady business!
i agree with corey, the office is very disorganized.
neither the doctor nor the nurse seemed to know what they were doing.
i stopped in friday around 11:30 am for a quick lunch.
customer service is not a strong value at this restaurant.
service couldn't be worse.
i shouldn't say that...
they probably could be worse!!
server came by once every 20 mins in between drink orders and food...
waited an hour to actually get the food which was sub par.
came on a friday night and expected a wait.
they quoted us (party of 4) 30 minutes and sat us after 75 minutes.
we were only offered water.
that wasn't necessarily a problem considering we only wanted water.
we just thought it was interesting.
it was like biting into a hockey puck.
the worst fat burger i 've ever been too.
prices are $5 6$ more than at any other fat burger.
very rude manager.
rather go to mcdonald's than here
i think her name is dhen.
unfriendly, coarse and unprofessional.
but the food is consistently good.
another employee saw me there for so long and asked if i needed help.
people like him should be in a position of authority.
so much for trying to support black owned....
i don't usually do these but the owner just rubbed me the wrong way.
just bad all the way around.
wine was so-so but overpriced.
i agree with everyone else, don't go here.
manager didn't seem to care.
will stay with ordering from amazon.
i recently had a baby and am not impressed with their care for newborns/babies.
i don't recommend palo verde pediatrics.
make that 1 hour 50 mins and they don't know what there doing.
they just lost another star.
worst experience i've had in memory.
we were given a discount, but i didn't see how much.
i couldn't get out of there fast enough and will never return.
they are probably upselling up front .
i left and went to get a hand car wash for $15.
half their price.
if i could give this restaurant 1 star i would.
terrible service, i'm pretty sure our waiter was high.
food is disappointing.
the whole experience was very weird and disappointing.
these guys came yesterday for a task specific move out clean.
this place is so slow!
it's ridiculous how long the wait is!!
i've never been out of here with my kids in less than 2 hours.
how is it possible to run so far behind!
i have better things to do with my time away from work than wait.
worst customer service ever.
slow, very slow.
extremely over priced.
very very very very boring, where are the people?
only gets 1 star because i can't leave 0 stars!
new patients beware.
what a waste of time on my part.
plus they don't care!
i wouldn't let them fix my kids play phone!!
i got $40 back with of course a argument!!
went there for breakfast during our stay in vegas.
the food was bland.
the eggs were tasteless.
what about the insult to our taste buds?
i expected better from a chef's restaurant.
they only good thing about the breakfast was the build your own bloody mary.
we definitely will not return to this place.
overpriced and lousy food.
if i could give zero, i would do it.
i drove 45mins to this store to have bad customer service.
so, i missed something here...mainly flavor.
i was  really confused because the ratings for this place are solid.
i didn't have mexican or asian flavors.
i was disappointed and gave up after the second bite.
poor customer service and slow service.
really hoping they open another location near here soon or change the staff.
rib count was about 9.
in ontario, we get two large pieces of ribs for this price/order at montana's.
this should not be served as a salad dish.
thankfully i ordered the french onion soup as an entree.
it was comforting, very salty but acceptable.
i will not be returning.
1 hour wait!!!?
and we were still six orders away!
how hard is it to throw fish in a fryer!!??
but drive thru was going fast.
they act like they're making gourmet food.
don't waste your time
food was good.
service was so slow.
over 3 hours to get our meal and get check paid.
first and last time.
too expensive to be sitting that long.
my biggest regret was not looking at these reviews before i booked on priceline.
the location is a total dive - bathrooms filthy dirty.
stay away from this garbage rental!!
never having pizza hut again.
we had 2 rounds of drinks and full entrees.
one star only because i have to.
she than took it out on my brows.
let's just say, i left with really thin brows and a super red forehead.
don't waste you time or money here.
i'm new to az, and the hunt for a good brow wiz will continue.
verrrry slow service from start to finish.
server didn't care and would not advocate for us.
definitely not worth the money.
hair is my scrambled eggs.
i will not be going back to donnas.
pretty sad because i work for a huge company right around the corner.
i will be networking at how unhygienic is place is.
i was conned into centurylnk service.lied to in every way imaginable.
ordered the coconut curry and my daughter had the shrimp terreyaki hibachi.
the flavor for the coconut curry was very bland.
the terryaki was just way to sweet.
i will not be returning here.
the skin around my nails is raw and sore.
shellac is bubbled and peeling off.
each nail is different from the other ..
my nails were dirty with shavings of sanding nails when shellac was applied.
the worst nail service i have ever had
dear guy: your breakfast should be called breakslow....
watch diners driveins and dives at home and order pizza.....
phenomenal towing is trash!
i've waited just about 3 hours for this company.
finally i said fuck it and cancelled the whole job!
gonna set up another tow call in the morning with a different company!
if i could give this company negative stars i would!
do not use this company!
had supper there with my family food took forever....
8.50 for blue cheeses and celery no thanks never again back
this location is unbelievable.
30-minute wait for about 10 people in line.
undertrained staffs who have no idea what they are doing.
avoid at all cost.
you don't need to know everything wrong, just run.
let it just suffice to say that it was vial.
not one edible item.
none of us could eat it.
left it and went home hungry.
worst chinese food ever.
oh well, i'll stick to super dragon, even if i have to drive further.
i came to this buffet last year in november.
i had 2 buffet vouchers with the front of the line passes.
this place was astounding, however, there was a hair in my meal.
however, we left empty handed and the buffet was refunded because of the hair.
i would rate them negative, if i could.
just had dinner here and we were really disappointed.
we waited an hour for our food.
the milkshakes came out 45 minutes before our food.
i still don't see why it took an hour to get fast food.
now to the good part, the only hot dish we ordered came out cold.
the rest of us had blt's.
may be he should be practicing in hollywood or at the white house.
it is easy to pass the bucket.
you are still getting 0 stars from me.
i am not happy leaving this place!
stay away if you can
don't bother making an appointment.
we deserve better.
how is this location still in business??
keep in mind this place currently has a 91 health rating.
it was inedible.
aside from the food, customer service is terrible.
no words were ever spoken from her.
i'm completely appalled with this location.
instead we voluntarily stopped eating despite not being full and left.
but the guy slicing the meat for us was very nice.
we had a group of friends meetup there for xmas this past weekend.
we ordered 4 of the tuna nacho appetizers or whatever they are called.
i ended up leaving and going to burger king.
so we walked inside and with no greeting the worker blurted our order.
shawnessy registry is advertising free license replacement for fort mcmurray fire victims.
this is a false advertisement.
she evacuated tuesday night with just the clothes on her back.
we are a regular customer of skyview fusion cuisine.
used to love their dim sum and food.
however, recently the food tasted stale and not fresh.
had the mushroom ravioli with some drinks.
really bad experience:(
i am at the regus at king and spadina and would not recommend it!
the walls are paper thin and you cannot get any work done at all.
why will you tell me in person, but not answer my emails?
this place is terrible, do not rent from them.
small chicken tenders and not tasty at all.
texas toast is not texas toast it's reg bread toasted.
went here for breakfast and it was gross.
nice staff but not good food.
the only thing i liked was the bacon and the ice cream.
not as good as the feast buffet at santa fe station.
refused to fix 1 nail.
broke a nail traveling and they refused to fix it.
when i explained they sent a worker to cuss me out....applauded!!!
never seen anything like it.
stay away from this establishment!!!
this place is worthless .
office manager is brainless and incompetent.
came here out of convenience...
so i decided to go there and found the place closed.
from this you may draw your own conclusion.
be careful !!
should have gone with my guy instincts for chains...food is terrible.
they'll blend tight in with the other screaming and yelling ones running wild.
one star goes for the beautiful view...
the music was beyond lame..
everyone just stood there..
beautiful venue ...really badly organized!
food is terrible, complete lack of flavor.
didn't even get cherries in my cherry limeade!
my nutella mocha tasted burned, no mocha or nutella.
i won't be stopping by again.
they just do not know how to cook anything.
this place is horrible.
they pulled me out and did not bother to ask if i needed help.
omg it was so disgusting i saw the mini cockroach on the window-sided table.
my friends and i called the waitress to have a look.
the short haired waitress presented she saw nothing we mentioned.
i won't go there again ...
obviously that is why there were absolutely zero customers in your restaurant.
and last i checked..
and the rude people working in this restaurant checked..
the groupon clearly states "limit 1 per table".
like i said..
worst customer service ever.
so happy i was able to spend my money elsewhere!
the food is great, but the service is horrible.
everyone outside the kitchen needs to be fired.
they need someone who knows how to run a restaurant.
how about fixings the problems.
horrible customer service.
waited 45 minutes for our food, the waitress only acknowledged us once.
they had a girl od ing in the bathroom.
i just want to speak with a doctor.
i would  give her all 5 stars, she tries  to  get us seen.
worst sushi ever!!!!!!
save yourself and do not go here.
you will thank me later!!
we tried it once ...
we will be returning to our regular fro yo place 5 minutes away instead.
our regular fro yo place was always fun and friendly.
this one is the opposite.
thanks, but no thanks.
this is pure lack of skill on sushi making.
the wait staff is also pushy and slow.
overall, not a good experience.
delivery was scheduled, and then ended up back in the warehouse.
company blames mechanical issues.
called customer service and listened to hold music for over 1/2 hour.
avoid this company at all cost.
this place is a complete money grabbing setup.
avoid at all cost.
i've never had a worst dental experience.
don't bother trying to call this "24/7" service doesn't return calls.
tried twice at 8pm and 9pm and no bother to call back.
waste of time.
this is one of the worst restaurant i have ever been!
my order was consisted in two salads only and one of this with meat.
the vegetables weren't fresh and it was  not any meat there.
and most important things they didn't offer me change it.
so i really wasted my time and my money (
this store seriously has the most rudest employees, ever!
this is all she said to the nice lady "wellllll you can google it".
employees with poor customer service and poor personalities.
no wonder she works there.
used to be a good place but i guess they have new owners.
had to insist on them washing my car twice to get it right.
if i could give less than half a star i would.
unprofessional and will waste your time.
book with tiffany at your own risk.
she won't show up.
don't go to this shop.
no different from taco bell !
i had higher expectations.
i will not be returning !
i don't even want anything else from here !
they have good crushed ice !
a disaster of a starbucks.
and so many problems.
there's a much nicer starbucks just diagonal in the bank of america plaza building.
please go there instead if you need a caffeine fix.
horrible customer service.
i usually love this location but my recent visit was awful.
i said vanilla shake 3 times and she still gave me a strawberry shake.
i also ordered fruit side and my grapes had mildew.
on top of all that the food wasn't enough good.
couldn't enough finish eating it.
i wish i could give 0 stars.
the employees here are disrespectful.
the lady doing nail my said the color i chose was ugly...
well good thing they aren't her nails!
and the lady i spoke to because i was unhappy with this disrespectful comment.
oh yeah it's my birthday!
rickety planes, questionable pilots, hours of delays every time, no customer service at all.
please be careful.
i got a groupon for reiki.
danced on stage.
bouncer told me to leave.
was complying, and he slammed my arm in a door.
service was terrible!
$5.50 for a yuengling!?
i'm confused who you think you are?
also very frattastic
this place has fucking shit service.
by the time i was seated, i learned 3 new languages.
the individual who was serving me knew one word, yes.
not to mention 11 people 2 grills oh baby.
he then filled our water with another tables left over water.
i am not tipping this half ass service.
my gels started chipping after two days!
the service is also quite awful!
never go here.
still waiting on a refund!!!
my husband purchased a muffler off them for his truck.
the muffler turned out not to be correct for our ford f150.
they placed the muffler on anyway and it literally fell off while driving!
they hire based on the token rule.
one minority per shift.
mangers are fake :)
the minute clinic is absolutely worthless.
she didn't even turn on the check-in kiosk until 10:10am.
first patient was seen at 10:25.
wtf cvs, get your act together.
i am devastated.
this used to be my go to place, not anymore!
the restaurant is dirty!
sad because this place used to be soooooo good!
this place f***king sucks!!
if i could give them a 0 i would.
they advertise themselves as urgent care yet they aren't.
i went there because i thought i had a bladder infection.
they told me i didn't.
i took my daughter there also and just got the same bill for her.
she also cut my hair.
it is all uneven.
you get what you pay for.....
don't go here.
spend the $40.00 dollars more and get a real professional.
we are nothing but live mannequin heads they practice on.
completely inept pharmacy.
constant monthly problems/shortcomings for every script, every month.
i've given up & moved on to another pharmacy after years of this abuse.
do yourself a favor and don't bother.
the menu is ridiculously small.
20 items and a plate of pasta $35 dollars.
next to the bathroom?
no thank you.
stupid "fancy" restaurant.
not feeling this place.
the price point for what you get along with quality is poor.
the chicken was dry and the toast lacks any kind of flavor.
stick with raising caines.
we could not see from our seats not to mention people standing.
the venue was not good for a showcase big time dancer like her.
i did enjoy the lobby of jlos clothes.
i hope her team realizes this and  understands.
love to jlo and her team
horrible service our waitress natalie sucked.
no refills her manager had to come get them for us.
century link has thenworse customer service in the city.
didn't show up or call for installation.
waited 3 weeks for new install date.
no show again.
guess it's time for cox, adios century link
i moved from arcadia last year and sadly, my home salon.
it's too out of the way to visit regularly anymore.
needless to say i won't be back and i am completely disappointed.
i do not believe this place is very clean after my experience.
it was my only bad experience with hertz.
no reason, no explanation about who did it, just cancelled.
however, the final amount on my credit card was usd 46.20 (cad 53.62).
i had the biscuits and gravy with sausage.
deep fried  potatoes, sausage and kale in old smelly oil.
really anyone can deep fry.
this company consistently calls me to view their resort.
i imagine their service at the resort couldn't be much better.
i used hotwire to reserve a mustang convertible for my trip to las vegas.
i couldn't believe how the representative never told me any of that.
wings were tiny, like if derek zoolander were there he'd have questions.
sauce was decent, but they rated it 4 out of 5 for heat...
i'd have rated it a 2 max.
only one server who was doubling as bartender.
i'll give her a break because she was alone, but come on.
there are much better options, won't be back.
everything tasted like garbage.
don't waste your time and money.
i agree with the people who also gave this place 1 star.
is this what eating out is coming to.
we arrived at 9pm.
after telling employee about gluten allergy she was careless with handling of product.
i travel for a living just a bad vibe at these new concept restaurants.
we left never to return.
rather pay more at fuel.
p.s. i have free coupon at mod's all yours!
eh 16 dollars for an eyebrow wax?!
no thank you!
too high tech!
5 employees working, zero customers.
they all look at you like they didn't want to help you.
left with no resolution to my problem.
the food however was not good.
unfortunately they failed to inform that the pretzel portion was not availabale.
this created a sloppy mess.
service stinks, server got our food order wrong.
completely dissatisfied with this place!!!!
if i could i would give no stars at all.
service was horrible, the lady wearing glasses was rude and unprofessional.
i will not come back and don't recommend anyone on coming here.
i might be bias...
but i didn't enjoy the show.
this was my first and last time coming to the show.
the owner is rude, obnoxious.
what happened to this chain, it used to be ok and now steer clear.
the waitress was nice and attentive though.
food is horrible, service was very good.
you get what you pay for.
old dried out food.
choices are pitiful.
wouldn't come back here if it was free!
don't go too late or they won't take your order.
they'll be asleep.
might be asking too much from a fast food group.
went in and was ignored.
this place is worse then before in my opinion.
please make some improvements.
p.s. the lighting sucks for playing pool and it's over priced as shit!
i'd given this place a five star originally.
the food quality has changed for the worse.
we ordered food, and it was generic and bland.
we thought it was a fluke so we tried them again.
same thing, food was generic and processed tasting, very bland.
sad: they started off so good.
i should have just left.
not very convenient at all
a little disappointed with this restaurant.
we called ahead of time to confirm reservations and vegan friendly meals.
the chef has posted all over social media that this place is friendly.
the end of it all we left very disappointed.
i will never stay here again!!!!!
very nasty place just filthy!!!!!!!you will leave with the itchy scratches
i went there at 4pm, so the place wasn't that busy.
they have created the stupidest delivery system for a fast food chain.
worst nail place i've ever been too.
my nails look like crap!!!
i'm so disappointed.
however, the nail design i asked for is ridiculously horrible.
all my nails are slanted and uneven.
my pedicure was really expensive but halfed as*!
i will never go back there.
this place should be disappointed on the job they did.
as we go here often, we chose to bring home take out yesterday.
she immediately threw it out.
safe to say, they lost a customer.
i would give them a negative * if i could.
they called me friday and told me to come in at 1pm sat.
told me i'd have to go to the airport to get a car
terrible jobs done here.
they try to up sale lots of services not needed.
overpriced overcooked frozen food....such a dissapointment.
frozen mac n' cheese on the bacon burger, bacon was rubbery.
dry stale pretzel roll.
frozen  french fries of multiple styles overcooked and cold.
i'd rather drink a poorly made drink than have to go back.
don't ever shop here!
this is the worst store ever!
they charge us over and won't give my money back....
and the lady that works there is so disrespectful !
please check your receipt so this won't happen to you guys.
long wait they dont wear the traditional uniform here either.
just overall disappointed and wouldn't return nor recommend.
wow, this place is awful.
i wish i could give zero stars because this place sucks!!
our bagel breakfast sandwich was so hard we could barely chew it.
my oatmeal was half full and one of our two burritos was cold!!
this day in age this is completely unacceptable.
it took us 10 minutes before our food was delivered to us!
save time and frustration and go anywhere but here!!
had a horrible experience there with a group of friends.
he said "i really don't care.".
my husband and i have dinner there occasionally.
after many years in the valley, goodbye to el chorro!
never go to this apartment unless u r crazy!!!!!!!
but when my friend went there,he found all the valuable things were gone!!!
laptop, skateboard, even the scales!
this experience is awful and i feel disgusting!!!!
my siblings and i entered the area.
it was really crowded and we did not see the 21+ signs.
we were kicked out in the middle of our dance dance revolution game.
i honestly wish this review was about the pizza.
i would never go back!
the service was horrible...
sat with empty drinks for half the night, even after asking.
the food was very average and way overpriced.
the sauce was not good and the shrimp was chewy.
i thought the seating was too close; felt crowded.
don't waste your time and money.
one of the worst experiences i have ever had at a restaurant.
took over an hour to deliver the food.
stay away if you hungry.
he was not insured with budget.
otherwise, don't drive to get this.
i really don't know what all the hype is about.
burgers are less than mediocre,  almost tasteless.
very incompetent company.
been calling over a week and a half.
finally got ahold of someone one.
was told they would be there within the hour.
so i moved my refrigerator out.
then got a call 2 hours later for a confirmation.
which was the wrong items of pick up.
and the prices were way too much-$14 for a small pizza?
was very disappointed in this place.
we tried this place for the first time using a groupon.
the garlic balls were very hard and the pizza reminded me of cardboard.
the only good thing we enjoyed was the salad!
the most horrible service on the planet...
and they weren't even busy, three customers sitting down at the most.
if you don't like working in the service industry, than don't!
worst customer service i have ever received!
someone else did...not a good company at all!
shop at nordstroms!!!!
customer service here is horrible!
the food is good, maybe have the kitchen staff work the front too!?!
that was after waiting 15 minutes for him to even look at us.
we came here on a yelp recommendation.
never again will i visit here and i'm a local.
wasted my money here.
very upset at the quality wish i could get my money back.
this place has decent food.
the prices are high as to be expected with hotel restaurants.
the biggest issue i have is their service.
the staff stayed busy with cleaning the place instead of paying attention to us.
really disappointed with the service.
i am generous with one star.
stopped in yesterday with high hopes.
this vape shop was highly recommend by several friends.
tony was very knowledgeable on vaping.
i purchased a system from this shop.
24 days later the tank cracked.
i was informed by tony to contact the manufacturer.
so i purchased another tank from another vape.
one star only because i can't give negative stars.
whatever you do, do not use das for any reason.
worst experience i have ever experienced with a company in my entire life.
customer service was lazy, disrespecting and completely worthless.
i wish i would've driven the car myself.
roach on the floor.
i will post the pic for you or try.
glad we saw it and didn't eat the food...
was looking forward to eating here due to reviews..
very slow service, food was cold and the drinks were watered down.
charged us to remake my wife's margarita.
dirty tables and bar.
will never return to this place and i suggest you don't either.
i will be taking my business somewhere else then.
i didn't want to write more but yelp doesn't accept short reviews.
the food was good.
not extraordinary but good.
service was also good but nothing special or awesome.
but the price was horribly disproportionate.
dont respect others, thinks herself smart but actually a stupid person.
i honestly don't want to waste my time in this cruel and idiotic store.
he/she might save their business.
its not very clean....
small, only 10ish tables for 4 and 2 tables for 2.
this place is ghetto, sooooooo ghetto.
they didn't care to fix the problem.
so we tell everyone of our bad experience and we will never go back.
most companies charge less than $75 for a diagnostic.
always shop around and get a 2nd opinion.
the tables were pushed together really close.
it almost felt as if i was eating in a cafeteria.
the food was also extremely bland.
our waitress was friendly but in general the service was extremely slow...
this meal was not worth what we paid.
"there is nothing we can do".
terrible customer service.
firearm was transferred to coyote after calling and checking with an employee.
three weeks later they are still holding who knows how many customers firearms.
this appears to be a very unprofessional and disorganized company!
will not return calls or give any updates as to what is going on!
poor poor slow service today.
this was the most disgusting food i have ever eaten.
full of msg!!!
i have a severe sensitivity to msg so i became incredibly ill.
worst food in the whole food court.
never go there.
very unprofessional, rude, and frustrating.
oh and security on site?
this whole place is a joke.
i wouldn't suggest moving here.
food was typical of what you would find in a fusion place.
nothing brilliant unless you are new to some of the dishes or asian food.
somewhat pricey without a coupon.
will not return.
called in to order.
girl was rude.
they forgot part of order.
then when called back they said i could come pick up the stuff forgotten.
not even an apology.
don't go here unless you want poor service.
that is no way to run a business.
that is simply an abusive way to view and treat your customers.
if we start respecting ourselves, airlines will soon follow.
worst company ever!
customer service is horrible.
won't answer phone.
won't return messages.
delivered items broken.
stole some of our belongings.
they should not be in business.
don't use this pool company.
i paid for the month in advance.
this was to be done every thursday.
not to be trusted.
done and done--happy to shop at more socially progressive grocery stores.
again, this is not coming from a doctor, & i doubt even a nurse.
i will not be returning.
i wasted enough time, energy, gas, & paid time off already.
terrible strip club!
the girls half assed the dancing & the food was awful!
the staff do not work together either!
i wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy!
bdg was hired in the spring of 2017 and fired by october 2017.
i had my oil changed here about six weeks ago.
since then my oil leaked out and my car is in the shop.
the service was so so slow.
an hour to change oil?
and you could tell they didn't care about customers.
if you value your car and your time, don't go here.
terrible customer service.
so many great pizza places in dormont and beechview.
go to any other pizza place in the area.
go to 24 hour fitness or eos but not this place
my daughter ate thete on dec 27th 2017 got severe foid poisoning.
she had the salad w chicken,eggs, ect.
abdominal pain, 101 tempvomiting.
w/in an hr or two eating there.
lasted 1 and half days.
so heres the latest.
the company  shows up in unmarked white trucks in the middle in the night.
they have no id on the trucks nor do the drivers.
they would have sense enough to due there work during the day.
i have also noticed these trucks coming into the complex fully loaded.
that somehow seems counter productive.
when i called them back because they phoned me christine transfered me to mike.
poor customer service with no value for the customer.
these people don't deserve one star.
they are over priced and the manager james sucks.
his people skills is horrible.
i would not ever stay here again.
don't stay here!
i really want to know who old is this lettuce?
it's so hard to eat healthy and this is exactly why..
don't waste your money if you did not grow up in the era.
we love the mirage and thought it would be a good show to watch.
it was horrible.
we saw mystere 4 times and it was awesome each time.
so my expectations were set high when i watched the show.
these tickets are not cheap.
my experience with this store was awful.
no apology given.
i will never go to this store again .
do not trust them.
they would probably give you the wrong prescription.
lousy customer service.
the customer service is just bad here.
also, the majority of the employees here are pretty rude.
it can be very off-putting.
we came here with friends after dinner to enjoy some games and drinks.
i like the atmosphere.
laid back and chill.
they have huge bean bags and couches.
this review is based on the service in the salon...
(for a kid's haircut??!!
just cut hair without the interrogation!
we got up and left.
i will never come to this place ever again!
*ps-go someplace else if you need giant barrels of shampoo (they're overpriced too)...
the warranty was 70 bucks.
i have always used enterprise rental car in the past.
never had a problem.
went there today and was treated like garbage.
no smile from the rep, just asked, what do you want?
please do something about your customer reps enterprise!
they are horrible!
will never go back.
at night it is a nightmare.
no sauna, small, very little amenities that other la fitnesses offer.
$100 fine for having an a-frame sign in front of my business door??
we took it home to our dogs it was that bad.
now, we remember why we don't go here.
i also asked for extra in my blizzard and there was barely any.
she obviously was too busy throwing a fit to pay attention to my order.
all of the food was ice cold and clearly made with low quality ingredients.
should have gone to shake shake next door.
yet another mcdonald's with a 24 hr sign that isn't a 24 hr location.
yet another pos.
the wait staff move our water glasses and were very nice.
the risotto with three shrimp and was so salty it was not good.
coffee was great.
the waitress was rude again when we were taking care of the bill.
when you pay over $100 for two meals good service is a must.
he stated the patio was full and it would be a thirty minute wait.
my velvet ice cream was just "okay", nothing special.
the waffles were cold, dry and bland.
definitely not worth the time and money to revisit this place
after which i contacted the manager "james" who was very  apologetic.
just nobody wants to tell you because it's not chic to say.
watch out for the warm salad.
rude rude rude.
guy opens late and doesn't say a word to us the entire time.
nothing special there.
take your business elsewhere.
first time here for lunch.
ordered a chili relleno.
this was not a good choice.
the beans and rice were flavorless.
i ate a few bites, paid more than it was worth and left.
this place is only being kept alive by the bianco hype.
the service was good - but don't want to go back.
toyota is toyota!
this is not the way to treat toyota customers at all.
disgusting rancid fish.
i'm not even exaggerating that the tuna was smelly, slimy, and warm.
the owners who are also the chefs didn't even apologize for the quality.
i will repeat this again from the tip i wrote below.
front desk staff was unpleasant with long lines.
quoted me $60 a day in person but paid $20 a day on expedia.
stains on the floor, no refrigerator or microwave.
you get what you pay for.
it's been 4 days and have had issues seeing.
thus place sucks and they are soooooo rude.
i'd rather pay full price than go there for insurance!
the gym members and the workers are great.
again, it's wayyyyy too expensive.
i gave them my email address and never heard from them.
again proves my point - bad management.
i purchased a wall clock in store, but unfortunately it stopped ticking.
i just wanted to replace their product that was defective.
never shopping at kirklands again.
so i've had three sessions and there's been no change to my skin.
what you actually get on your plate.
all of this for $40 per person plus tax and tip.
this is the most dissapointing meal and most expensive meal i've ever had.
this branch gave me a rental car without a license plate.
way to go enterprise.
nope i'm done slid my card in the kiosk and headed out.
won't be going back
many issues with pepe's.
first, prices are quite high for the type of food/restaurant it is.
second, the amount of food for the price is small, kid size.
third, my food was cold.
the bean burrito was cold in the middle.
lastly, they charge a 50 cents service fee for using my debit card.
my bill was just over 9 dollars.
that's over 5% of my bill.
i own a business, and fees are not 5%.
i will not go back.
smoking right out front of your business is such a turn off.
these are not the people that i want handling my food.
you have outstanding food but your employees are not great !!!
steer clear of this location!!!
the slowest phucking subway restaurant i've ever been to ever.
they need to get their act together with this place.
other than that, i'm forsure never going back to this location
michael spadoni made a few racial slurs that did not sit well with us.
not being able to enjoy them.
first and last visit if michael spadoni is still there.
terrible return policies and unhelpful customer service.
hadn't even opened the books and they wouldn't give me a refund...
the worst rental car place i've ever been too!
so they might be able to do simple clerical/administrative work with competency.
very disappointed with the kitchen staff.
thanks deli workers 4 your years of great food and service.
we the customers will miss you
completely disappointed by this experience!!!
my husband and i picked this steak house to celebrate our wedding anniversary.
what a complete let down.
$200 that i could have saved...and completely ruined my anniversary!!!
my friend commented that she wasn't sure she wanted to pay a cover.
i know it sounds like there must be more to the story...
but there isn't.
it was baffling.
stupid way to run a business.
this place is the worst.
a bunch of kids with no respect work here.
i ordered a tuna sandwich.
the worst tuna and bread.
please don't waste your money
ate sunday night dinner at capital seafood.
the chicken was over cooked and dry.
beef dish was cooked in an unknown sauce with too much onions.
a seafood casserole dish did not contain much seafood at all.
the only passable dish was the snow pea pod vegetables.
came with visiting friends from foreign.
will not return or recommend.
awful customer service.
however she approached this with "nope.
no. no we don't have those" and walking away.
i am korean and i know what good korean food taste like and wow....
this place serves the worst disgusting tasting food i have ever tasted.
the soup was too salty and tasted like dishwater!
the dumplings were gross and no flavor!
i went in hungry and came out concerned if i might get food poisoning.
stay away people!
well we tried this place for a second time and highly disappointed.
$26.00 later for a salad, kids meal and soup and sandwich.
burned sandwich and barely little fruit.
supper pricy $$$$$$ no free water even for your meds !!
it's against the law to charge for water for a patient taking medication.
but they don't care !!
my stay here was for about 8 nights.
poor cleaning job.
my room toiletries looked old my first night there.
no working fridge.
when we had our room cleaned by housekeeping.
we notice the half ass job.
the toilet was definitely not cleaned.
this racist bar deleted my review about their racist bartender.
they deserve 0 stars .
i'll never go to any putters ever again!
i've never seen such a waste of personnel in my life.
please do not give this company any of your business.
please do not support these illegal acts.
dr. jenny h.
kim is the worst eye doctor ever.
if you have an appointment.
you can forget about being seen at your appointment time.
this will be the last time my family of 6 ate coming here.
for how much this buffet is you would expect much better food.
also they charged our party an automatic 80$ tip and the service was terrible.
the rio buffet is much better if you are a buffet type person:/
absolute terrible food prep and zero response from manager.
ordered take-out, one item being loaded fries.
never realized ordering fries and some ranch dressing was dangerous.
last july i purchased a house that was to be rented.
the ladies were allowed to be left alone to do their cleaning.
that amounted to over $20,000 in damages.
jay and his ladies told me they knew nothing about it.
since we did have insurance, i only had to pay the $1,000 deductable.
when i placed this review on jay's website, he has failed to post it.
so, buyer beware!!!!
got the pad thai from here and it didn't taste anything like it.
don't get it.
made reservations way in advance for mother's day for indoor seating.
they got sat ahead of us.
great food and it ends there unfortunately.
update: i emailed the email address given below almost immediately.
it has been almost 3 full days and i haven't received a reply...
scheduled an oil change.
came in 10 minutes early.
absolutely will not go back to this location .
we live 12 miles a way.
the managers rudely worded  reply was just to come back in.
there's so many choices of food in las vegas.
don't choose this place.
missed items in the dishes we ordered.
all around disappointment to the las vegas allure
not only that but i noticed they had actually damaged my car!
where do i start.
the service was slow to non existent.
there was simply no excuse for the poor service.
the fried calamari was horrible.
it had no flavor.
this place has really gone down hill over the years.
disappointed in phoenix, mike
customer service is crap after midnight!!
after backing out of drive thru she cut the light back on!!!
avoid this place
the teacher i had played rock  how the hell do u dance to rock??
swiss chalet used to be good.
chicken was horrible tasting, no flavour, my ceasar was disguisting.
grab some new chefs ya bozos.
we had an an appt.
this morning at 10am, we received a confirmation email on monday (today is wednesday).
no one arrived, no one called, and no text or email ??
i used to go out of my way to go to this pizza hut.
recently, they can't seem to get an order right.
pepperoni lovers pizza should have spots where you see the crust.
they don't read it.
i won't order online anymore.
in fact, i'm not going to this pizza hut anymore.
my friend ordered a corned beef sandwich and it was definitely not kosher.
it tasted like pork!
he threw it out.
cannot believe this place gets high ratings for their corned beef.
something is wrong with that!
so we went here this morning it's the closest fast food restaurant near us.
it was too late to go back return as we were on a schedule.
so we just left it.
came home to find the sundae nearly melted and there wasn't enough fudge.
never coming back
check your mail las vegas collision.
i don't know what's going on with this location.
i'm currently at the 18 minute mark in the drive thru.
and it looks like they don't multitask.
fix this place please.
5 lawsuits in 2 years!
i was here couple days ago.
i'm visiting from houston.
everywhere i have been the people have been wonderful.
the restaurant was bare no one was in there and i went at 1pm.
it won't be long till this restaurant closes.
i will stick to jimmy the greek, and milos greek in pickering.
total rip off!!
this an old scam and sorry to hear this dealership is sending them out.
the food didn't taste all that bad.
the bbq squid was a bit dried out.
the servers were excellent.
probably the worst customer service i've received.
i hate this place but it's next to the hospital i work at.
much of the staff are mentally retarded.
overall they just take too fucking long.
what a joke, guys on the street giving 2 for 1 coupons.
you go inside, order a well drink which then costs you $13!
what kind of scam is this.
i'm used to expensive drinks on the strip, but this is over the top.
worst place ever.
they have the worst costumer service.
tao sucks .
not good night life.
and the tables are definitely rigged.
she even had help..
and not fake..
if i were the manager she'd be gone..
bad for business..
food had no taste based on the two meals we ordered.
i felt if i ate a mcdonald's it would have had more flavor.
was not impressed at all.
never will go back!!
if i could give a minus 5 i would.
worse venue that gives the worse vibe.
this was the worst car buying experience ever!
skip, run- whatever- take your money & business elsewhere.
land rover misses the mark on 101 customer appreciation.
tried the red velvet cupcake.
oily, premade frosting.
the cake was dry and flavorless.
mi culpa por no haber preguntado si eran naturales.
this place deserves 0 and the health inspector needs to take a look!!!!
a roach was in the soup i was feeding to my daughter!!!!
never coming here again!
how disappointing my last visit here, and it was entirely attributed to the staff.
it was like the place has been taken over by high schoolers.
possibly the worst customer service on the planet.
worse liars in sales hands down.
i would not buy anything these people tried to sell you.
it's such a shame that the quality of the noodles here have gone south.
it was perfect when it opened.
let me start by warning all potential visitors of the prices.
i paid $4 for a 22oz fountain drink.
overall the pizza was extremely bland.
i have had better frozen pizza from the grocery store.
i ate a slice and dumped the rest.
my wife is very certain that the manager was drunk.
otherwise, it's a pretty place with lots of windows...
take your chances
pass you around from person to person b.
do not return your emails or voicdmails.
i wish i had done more research before signing on with this office.
please do not leave me a response either mr. cordova, it's not necessary.
the worse earl of sandwich ever!!
this location can't seem to get anything about my drink correct.
except this one.
charge wrong ,make the drink, wrong with attitude ....
never returning to this location.
good thing others aren't this rude.
i called humana pharmacy to get a quote for my husband's prescription medicine.
after spending 15 minutes going through phone system and identification, etc.
no no no - this place is not good.
when you are in vegas you should treat yourself to a quality meal.
do not come to battista's because it seems like a great deal (its not).
the money you save on the all-inclusive option just isn't worth it.
please do not trust the positive reviews and stay away.
let's just say you wouldn't eat here for good service.
extremely disappointed and dissatisfied with this restaurant.
not worth it to get a tattoo here...
only to get home and find out the transaction actually did go through.
avoid the place and go somewhere else, anywhere else.
finally the manager told me to come in and i wouldn't have any problem.
guess what now they want her to fax a copy.
not even one star
bus #8 driver at the virgin america terminal.
horrible customer service.
i left a voice mail for the rental car center.
i hope they get they customer service in order at this terminal.
just left this hooter's after eating the most foulest oyster.
i have never tasted something so horrible.
i pray i don't get food poisoning from it.
told our waitress about it and got an "oh", that's it!
the overall service was fair, nothing great.
i never give one star.
went for a bite at an awkward time on sunday, between lunch and dinner.
had the duck fat fries and buffalo chicken wings, neither of which were great.
would have been okay, but the service was just plain rude.
by far the worst service i've ever received at any restaurant.
food: 2/5service: 0/5ambiance: 4/5
in stead of ordering my meal like i had told her.
she ordered everything separate.
when i went to fill my medium cup.
i ordered a large, there were ants crawling all over the fountain machine.
this was by far the worst pizza i've ever had.
i don't think so.
we ate 2 slices and tossed it in the trash.
give me a break.
can't wait until the day yellow cab goes out of business!!
the fries were decent though so ill give them that.
needless to say go elsewhere for a burger.
was just going to have lunch there and check it out.
it was not even busy.
i have trained my dog at partners for over 1 year.
he told me it was company policy.
i guess they don't need my business.
i have never been so pressured by a cashier to open a kohl's card.
how many ways do i have to say no?
are you trying to reach a quota or what?!
glad i was just passing through and this isn't my local store.
they charged me for something they never actually did.
i refused to pay for it as it was their billing error.
and then a year later, i find it on my credit report.
their customer service is bad and so was their service.
if i could leave a comment without a star i would.
i was in pain for 3-5 days after my cleaning.
the service is awful and very sexist.
don't ever come here
we asked for a refund within 15 minutes of arriving.
which i've never had to do before.
each station had very little selection and what they did have wasn't appealing.
they couldn't get wood fired pizza right.
prime rib was tough.
for the 36.00 per person it wasn't even close to being worth it.
don't bother or waste your money here.
wish i could give this place negative stars...
i got up and left.
never going back again.
the waiter was okay.
the manager never came to the table (which would have never happened before)!!
stay away unless you have cash.
wow this food was really horrible.
at least they give you free sodas and lemonade.
redeeming qualities are desert, pasta bar, and salad bar.
not worth $30/person
i can't believe i ate this!!
i can't believe they're selling this!!
the impossible burger is well named...
please stop serving this!!
we are leaving the practice.
they told me there was no one i could see until the following morning.
we did and she did in fact have an infection.
it took 5 min at an urgent care and a $300 bill later.
she would have had someone see her- really?
it takes no time to run urine.
read wonderful reviews on yelp.
placed reservation on open table.
arrived at restaurant on time.
now sure why...
went there on sat night.
also you have to order bottled water, you can't get a glass of water.
worst shawarma in the gta.
food quality is poor, food is not fresh, assortment also limited.
attitude from the staff is mediocre, like they don't want to be there.
price is the same as everywhere else that serves good shawarma, keep driving!
i had a facial here and bought a voucher from groupon.
i definitely will not go back!!!
it is chinese run and chinese people are cheap!
also...they do not change the sheets or towels used from the previous customer!
i personally do think it was even worth the $37 i paid for groupon.
came in to get some juice.
i was not impressed in the least.
the selection was limited and there was no opportunity to try the juices.
i bought a bottle and a tank.
the juice was disgusting (chemical taste) and the tank broke within a week.
my husband ordered the hawaiian pancakes.
i'm not saying it was related, but it was related.
we both agreed we will never be back.
bought a tandem axle trailer from this company.
it kept burning though tires.
they were 1 5/8" off in alignment.
took it back to diversified and they won't warranty it.
cheap trailers and lousy service.
find another company!
i've had frozen pizza that tasted better.
if i could give a 0 i would.
the person in charge was extremely rude bordering on scary.
best decision ever!!
don't bother with this place.
instead go to l'oeufrier!
omggg so yummy, waitress servi e at the same prices and excellent friendly service.
love there food but every time we go in there it's hot......
they to cheap to turn down the a/c  we live in phoenix .....
do something about it !!!
i order two separate items on black friday for christmas.
i was billed and received confirmation for both.
both orders were set to deliver by christmas.
on the 20th both items were canceled and the products labeled out of stock.
these deals don't exist.
they just use them as a ruse to get you to their website.
stop by here today while visiting canada.
the store was located across the street from my hotel.
the yelp reviewers hyped me up to thinking the food was awesome.
the people that own the place was super nice.
bottom line i was not impressed and will not be returning
do not buy anything from frys unless your life really depends on it.
staff is rude,policies are wrotten, and they sell 2nds.
becareful and check everything and save your receipt.
also the food appeared to have been sitting out.
we should have known better but we proceeded to eat there anyway.
i had the worst food poisoning of my life after eating here.
the next 24 hours were absolutely hell.
i would recommend steering clear of this buffet and the mirage in general.
not happy with how much i spent on this
this is not a port of subs to visit.
the meat is thinner than paper and you won't get anything resolved by reporting.
just need to close this place down so many health violations seems like anyhow.
just don't come here!
moreover, most zoos have more extensive aquaria than cleveland's and charge much less.
i would not recommend this as a tourist destination.
unfortunately this was not the case.
still pissed from last week trish.
you said that you would pay for our meal and to leave.
we would never skip on a meal.
but you helped yourself with passed information.
$54 dollars for $30 bill is wrong.
we just wanted to eat our meal in peace.
still not over this shit..
never go here.
if you're listed open till 12 then you should stay there.
out of donuts?!
you are dunkin' donuts!
you are a chain restaurant that sells donuts all day long!
you should be overflowing with donuts that early in the morning.
poor management at this location, clearly.
tried this restaurant for the first time today.
the pizza had tomato sauce.
stay away from this mess.
i will not return to this place.
they are stuck up and rude.
if they want to discriminate, that's fine.
i will tell everyone i know not to go there for a drink.
the food here was rather disappointing.
my friend and i shared the misto platter (assortment of cheeses and meats).
then she says he sees 60-80 patients a day.
the manager in my opinion is not trained well on customer service.
it took 25 minutes for them to get the travelers ready crazy.
another far below average establishment with gimmicky fare.
should have stayed a liquor store.
***update***rick, could you be any more disconnected or dishonest???
i had no problem being seated.
your restaurant was almost empty.
creating an issue that doesn't exist makes you even less trusting.
room wasn't ready on arrival.
waited almost an hour.
when we got back close to midnight, nobody had even looked at it.
had to change rooms to double beds at close to midnight.
kids running up and down the hall at 7 am.
overall it was a train wreck.
it was very strong.
place has a history of poor hygiene habits as referenced by health inspections.
i'll never eat here or go here again.
i am not sure where to even start with this place!
i expected more from being las vegas.
not only was the crowd a bit weird, the bar tender was completely inattentive.
las vegas gay clubs are a disappointment.
a little more then disappointment.
(hours were 12:30-6 today).
nasty female manager or thinks she is.
totally bad attitudeplace needs a manager with a personality.
i will not be back.
ha ha we stayed here a few years ago.
my first time staying down town.
the price was pretty good, but i would rather pay more and have more.
no more for me.
no compensation, no apologies.
nail in the coffin?
the pre-paid shuttle to the strip is more expensive to book through allegiant.
worst experience i have ever had in a casino.
as soon as she took the first bite she could tell something was wrong.
i never really leave bad reviews but this is not ok.
its called curbside but tonight it was pick-up for me.
no apologizes at all.
the restaurants wasnt busy so there is really no excuse.
with all the great reviews we decided to try this place.
wasn't happy, of course were used to texas mexican food.
the refried beans taste funny to us.
the tacos weren't anything to writ about.
i guess a lot of nc's love this place,  but we won't be back.
we r too spoiled with our mexican restaurants in texas.
looks like a cafeteria.
cheap plastic tables and a printed paper menu on the wall.
i was scared to eat there and walked out.
they must have paid for ratings
tired business travelers be ware!
i will never do business again with this company (or this location).
we ended up calling aaa and having it towed to their business.
i do not recommend this business!!!!
they come off as nice guys but in the end they're lazy mechanics.
another cheap chinese food restaurant.
ordered the teriyaki chicken, doesn't come with anything but rice and chicken.
had to ask for vegetables which costed extra.
there sauce wasn't very good either.
i'm sorry but they get 1 star from me.
very ill after eating bouillabaisse and a  coffee just after noon today.
nausea within 30 minutes and explosive diarrhea an hour later.
one mussel shell was cracked and i assumed the mussel itself had been removed...
doesn't deserve one star.
these people steal your money and give you a half serving.
this place doesn't deserve to stay in business.
so pissed off!
this is what i ordered: 2 pc catfish meal...
where's my catfish fool!
i got robbed by captain d's!
the scones and fresh squeezed juice are probably the only good thing left here.
we went in for some breakfast after a late night.
waited for ten minutes for anyone to talk to us.
walked around the corner to find the waitress asleep.
take a nap before you come to work!
at first view this seemed like it could be a fun place for 18.
at hole 16 our cart ran out of juice.
fine water, terrible customer service.
after calling to set up my account, they never sent me any bills.
we got an email from bruce , the manager.
here's what was said:i'm throwing away those boxes you left just this time...
we are not republic services, and this is not the dump.
- the style of his communication doesn't even deserve a one star.
i ordered through the sb app which stated 4 to 7 minutes.
my two tall blonde roasts have been poured about 5 minutes ago.
i had to ask the barista to pour me a fresh cup.
all this and i wasn't even the angrier customer at that time.
extremely poor judgement and assistance.
drinks: 2 x tall blonde roast coffee
placed my order at 1:12pm and was stuck in the drive thru until 1:38pm.
if not for the cement blocking my escape, i would have left earlier!
no "sorry for the wait".
the noodles where hard and clumpy , the broth was oily and flavorless ..
even the green tea tasted burnt how do mess up green tea ..
other reviewers are right, zero is the correct rating for this company.
i don't know how they stay in business.
met up with some friends.
but this visit was not so good.
waitress told us from now on it's all "ice berg" for all the salads!
we won't be going back as we can get iceberg salads anywhere.
felt bad for waitress she was annoyed too.
ew. don't go here, i like found like a weird like bug?
in my chicken?
i thought it was just a big piece of pepper?
btw it wasn't.
i also found out that their chicken is f.a.k.e! that spells fake..
i said that's ok, i am disabled.
long story short, they didn't think i was disabled enough.
the clerk then exasperatedly sighs and states nono.
he will allow us to sit there, but if a, you know....
someone in a wheelchair comes in i have to move.
i guess because he can tell by looking what's wrong with me?
we usually love this place.
however, today, we waited well over an hour for our food.
and that it's not counting the twenty minute wait to place or order.
when it finally did, my order was up but my husband's wasn't even started.
on top of this, my food wasn't cooked right.
i've never had such poor service here.
we ended up leaving and going across the street to ihop.
hopefully, they can manage their time better.
so i had the pho cravings at the eating centre.
i see liberrhea noodles have the pho so i order.
basil leaf taste like the used tea leaf.
cow beef taste like the soggy dog brains.
no spring onion.
no soup base.
this not the viet style.
if you like the pho, uncle sam suggest the chinatown one.
so authentic you hear owners signing along to the vietnamese musics.
we will not be back.
caesar salads tasted almost mayonnaise-based rather than caesar based.
huge disappointment to start our weekend.
however loud annoying soccer fans singing group songs at 9am is super whack.
so much so that we left after driving 30 just to eat there...
this place is close to my house, eat here at lease twice a month.
but the last few visits sure were disappointing.
the salsa bar was dirty.
tables were not clean.
i have had good fish taco there, but will find a new location.
my car was damaged.
no response from das after 4 days.
my was corporate relo.
i am considering filing a claim with my company  usaa.
i tried to order a california burrito with chicken.
they tell me they are out of chicken.
i said fine ill take a regular california burrito.
will never be back...
till i die lol jk but for real never goin back
they still owe well over $700 on the judgment.
avoid doing business with them.
they are scammers and have no integrity whatsoever.
too loud if you are looking for a place to chat.
food was not very good.
not my cup of tea.
staff is friendly but that's about the only good to this place.
the place is understaffed and over crowded with patients.
i have yet to receive a phone call from any of his "friendly" staff.
we won't  go back and won't recommend this place to anyone.
i was trying to save some time and money and now u know better.
i am so beyond mad that i can even.
wanted to get a new pair of glasses...
went at 130.
doors were locked and no lights on.
lunch was at 1200-1 on the door.
i guess they don't need the money !!
sad face panda
unethical practices this pertains to some of their suppliers as well.
they continually sell moldy berries.
old wilted produce kept on shelve too long.
they will even say it is the suppliers fault for such item conditions.
stop selling stuff that you wouldn't take home to your mother.
our drink order took a half hour.
prices were ridiculous for the portions.
i'd never go back.
there are better options with less pretensions in town.
we hired this company to help us with finding a lost pet.
i will never recommend this company to anyone.
came for the halo halo, left with a bitter taste of horrible service.
gave them $10.25 expecting a toonie back to which they started scrounging for change.
i wasted half an hour for a simple drink order.
too bad really; the drink was decent.
purchased room through expedia.
buyer be warned!
do not shop here unless you know what your looking at.
you might ask, did they know of the damages?
the answer is yes!
be careful .
was a patient.
i had the chipotle avocado chicken sandwich on wheat bread.
the sandwich was of great quality but it lacked in meat.
it was literally i small piece of chicken for every two bites.
if as if your paying for just the bread.
service was friendly and prompt.
but the food was so overpriced and unimpressive .
i am so over the mediocre overpriced food at applebee's.
i am not going back.
what kind of business do you run??
sign says "closed for thanksgiving" really??!
what doesn't that mean are you closed all week??
it's the day before thanksgiving everywhere is busy and you are closed!!
won't be back!
just left and lousy service, shorted order, then they say didnt charge for it.
i paid 14.00 for a smokeburger combo.
they shorted me 3 plain cheeseburgers.
when i asked for a receipt they couldnt get me one.
then on phone trying to talk to who they say was mgr.
but very broken english, and couldnt explain problem.
im not prejudice,hell im mexican and i couldnt understand her
360 burrito was some of the worst food i have ever tasted anywhere.
i find it hard to believe that this place is still open.
first, you pay a fortune to get food that is tasteless at best.
the chicken was incredibly dry and devoid of any taste.
please do yourselves a favor and never eat here.
overprized and bad services.
how it comes that they are still in the business.
people shop around!!
my dads ginger ck with pinapple tasted like fish??
and tell me why the creme was pink??
bah never again!
told my husband about modern margarita and he was up for trying somewhere new.
ended up telling the manager we just wanted to close our tab and leave.
yard house is where we went and they never disappoint!
no wonder why they are extremely successful!!
i'll start by noting that the food is overpriced for the taste/quality.
i ordered my pizza from this location.
they told me 30 to 40 minutes even though i'm a mile away.
they got bad customer service and not timely.
pay double, triple, whatever it takes but don't rent from here.
1 1/2 hr wait and old car
was looking so forward to having a good breakfast before work, did not happen.
eggs were cooked fine.
cook needs to learn what extra crispy is and not serve cold toast.
i will tell you our waitress was fantastic aloma.
overpriced for an old dirty motel...
the odd thing was that there was a ton of open seating!
the entire bar area was unoccupied, as were all the tables outside but one.
we wanted to sit outside and enjoy some food.
there was a santa 5k that morning.
we ended up leaving and going to eat somewhere else.
the waffles tasted plain and not quite right.
the bacon tasted weird too.
don't think i will be returning.
worst part - i was automatically charged an 18% tip for terrible service.
it is a very inconsiderate office.
they rather follow the their protocol than a patient in pain.
i come here for heel pain.
my doctor ordered an insole for my shoes to elevate the pain.
i would never recommend this office to anyone
awful on so many levels.
went in for the first time for an ear infection.
a simple ear infection turned into an hour and forty-five minute appointment.
when i went to check out, there were patient files sitting on the counter.
not sure how they are still in business.
i also sent 2 email messages.
each call i made was transferred and i was told to leave a message.
i sure hope we will be accommodated this evening at 7:00?
i which i will change my review at that time!
so far, poor team management!
what i especially dislike are the chicken knuckles aka chicken fingers.
how in the heck do you really expect to get away with rotten service.
shame on you!!!
a great location with piss-poor food.
worst experience ever...
no one knew how to make small tortillas for tacos or kids quesadillas.
how can you be a manager and not know how to do everything there.
i cant believe how bad the service was.
i have never had this at any of the other locations.
i decided to order the crispy chicken.
batter was soggy an no flavour.
they said a hint of swiss chalet sauce.
much bigger pieces.
something is not quite right here.
not happy at all with my stay this time.
a hotel like this should never have this issue.
for two days in a row the room was notcleaned appropriately.
the beds were half made and towels were not replaced.
never seen anything like this.
very bad performance sheraton.
horribly unprofessional, don't subcontract to lazy techs.
would rate zero stars if i could.
horrible customer service and company.
do not purchase their products.
you will not get any help when you have trouble.
doctors are gteat,but the support staff and scheduling staff lack organization.
constantly making a mess of things.
it is impossible to call and actually talk to a person.
leave a message and 10 percent of the time they will call you back
dont count my single star.
so i come here often, it's right by my apartments.
three weeks ago, or so, i fell in love with the midnight mint mocha.
so i'm officially giving up hope on getting that first one, almost $100 later.
factoring in the drinks i bought for everyone.
the absolute worst!!!
i was a loyal customer for years and always very happy.
two months into my last pawn the snd changed ownership.
not these guys!!!
never again will i do business with them.
they dont deserve any stars!!!
why dan harkins is the soda water at this particular theatre not filtered???
it is so frustrating.
feels like the south east valley may be getting slighted a bit.
do not go here.
total was $12.
get to the window, pay, and was handed a vanilla cone.
they made every single one vanilla.
my favorite food is viet.
this restaurant left much to be desired.
the water tasted like well water.
the pho tai was bland.
the spring roll (cha gio) is indescribable as was the fish sauce (nuoc nam).
if i could give zero stars, i would.
worst service in vegas i have ever received.
we left shortly after finally reminding them that we needed seated.
worst place ever please save your time and head further down the strip.
typical, charges us a 18% gratuity for my wife, friend, 2 kids and i.
will never even think about coming back here!
18% for what.
18% for 5 and more.
i've been to the cheesecake factory in seattle and bellevue several times.
however, this past experience was terrible.
the wait was ridiculously unjustified for the quality of food we were served.
the coke was without syrup twice in a row, basically watered down coke.
i'm disappointed and don't plan on going back.
feels like an over prized place for under quality food.
very very bad quality.
never going to come back here at all.
i tried their chicken shawarma .
highly priced, was not freshly cooked and didn't taste like an sharwma at all!
first & last time trying this place!!
what type of sushi is that?
it cooks the fish & it's mushy all around..
avoid this store at all cost.
absolute terrible customer service, i feel judged every time i enter this store.
sales associate give off a vibe like they hate their job.
not to mention i had to file fraud on them to my bank.
they will accept the return but they won't actually give you back your money.
they blamed it on my bank and told me to just to keep waiting.
what a joke..
i was told their sever was down and couldn't take any orders.
they couldn't do the manual back up plan.
real irish pubs do not charge a cover.
real irish men do not pay a cover.
friends of real irish men do not pay a cover.
and neither should you.
not in dublin, and certainly not in toronto.
please spend your money somewhere else, service and quality is not up to par.
i've had horrible service/quality the last 4 times i went in.
staff never apologizes for the inconvenience.
i'm don't with this restaurant.
this store is filthy and the selection of clothing is awful.
theres bugs crawling all over the place, stains on the carpet, clothes flung everywhere.
close this dump down, its a disgrace.
i have never seen a store so dirty.
i was very disappointed in the room we got.
we had been staying in best westerns for almost 2 yrs.
building up points so we had a free night.
we come back and they had put us in front of the ice machine.
we ask for another room the next day and was told there weren't any.
don't think i would stay there again.
all they said is yes they could have called me.
the event costs $22.50 to get in and food samplings cost $5-8.
drinks are $5.
some of the food was good, but nothing had a real wow factor.
top chefs and new food ideas?
just trendy food trucks.
food trucks are great, but not for what it costs you here.
a lot items sell out quickly, there are long lineups and no freebies.
i don't feel i got my money's worth and i left hungry.
had buffet - really disappointed.
do not stay here!!!!
stained and dirty floors, walls, the whole room!
read all bad reviews and take them seriously!!!
look at all pictures and believe what you see!!!!
don't stay here!!!!!!!!!
poor customer service.
would prefer other options in the area.
save your money and go to go pro motorplex.
won't be back!
we showed up for a 5 o'clock birthday reservation at 455.
we let the hostess know and she said it would be 10 minutes.
i was told to sit at the bar.
at this point i said "forget it, we will go elsewhere".
the reply was a smile and an "ok".
as a new local, this was not a good first impression.
-reservation date 13 july.
i'm disappointed and will not be returning ever again to this place.
ajk is way better than this.
we were highly recommended to the shop by 2-3 people !
unfortunately none of these were the case ....
worse tax company ever.
they screwed up my taxes big time and cost me thousands of dollars.
if you want your taxes completely messed up this is your firm.
extremely unprofessional, unapologetic and careless.
i don't understand how they can still be in business...
the food was good but, the portions are small and over priced.
don't recommend it.
i came and drove miles away to use a gift certificate.
they did not honor it.
guadalupe was the managers name.
she was a pleasant lady but still couldn't provide a solution to the problem.
they all looked like seers with headlights.
they specifically said they knew nothing of the coupon and did not honor it.
the certificate had the location name and address.
i'm sure their food was delicious but they're marketing on the other hand.....
this place was terrible.
even the dessert station was seriously lacking.
save your money and go somewhere else.
i ordered $65 headphones on amazon.
three days ago ontrac marked it as delivered.
either way it was marked as delivered with no attempt to contact us.
this company is terrible and amazon should cease using them immediately.
we were seated by someone and then never attended to.
waited about 5 minutes while the staff hung out chatting across the way.
we got up and left.
no one said a word.
they were not even busy.
we show up tonight and the guy says 2hrs!
we told him, but it's not on him,  i get it.
don't have her name but, liar!
must make commission off all the phony cards you sell.
finally got things worked on.
everything they said they fixed either broke the next day or within a week
food below average.
he refused to provide a refund because he said we were rude.
ended up leaving food at the counter and walking out the store.
not worth the time, maybe dickie's corporate will take it back.
came here for breakfast..
for 10 am.
we were told there would be about 45 min wait.
no problem i get its sunday morning wait is expected.
it's now 11:30 and we just got our table!!!
after speaking to the hostess twice.
wont be coming back here, the wait is just way to long....
service is not that great either.
this place is a joke..
i ordered food, waited over 40 minutes only to receive the wrong meal.
i waited another 20 minutes for the waitress to come check on us.
so i am about $13.00 deep and i still have not had lunch..
if i could leave  less starts i would!!
i was not charged.
i hope their kitchen staff takes necessary steps to avoid future incidents.
as i am writing this review i have yet to see my food.
we have been given complimentary chips & salsa.
however, i have seen 2 other tables get their food before me.
be aware of bed bugs!
the hotel was still under renovation so a lot of rooms were unavailable.
definitely not a 4 star hotel.
i would rate this a 3 star hotel.
missed my scheduled window all together.
i rescheduled and the estimator did not show up again the following day.
my hoa was covering the cost as i only own the airspace...
this place was close to our gate and had a vegetarian option.
normally, we enjoy mexican food and i find it pretty hard to screw up.
until we got a veggie burrito from here, that is.
i am gluten intolerant and needed to have my meal gluten free.
i asked for a plain piece of chicken with marinara sauce.
i experienced an allergic reaction as a result of this contamination.
will not be returning here.
ordered a smash cake for my son a week prior to the date needed.
went to pick it up and they never made it.
over an hour later we were able to pick up a cake.
got home about 10 minutes before the party started.
the taste was okay.
definitely not the same as this bakery used to be.
i'll be on the lookout for a new bakery.
it took over two hours to get in and out with a small party.
the server did not know what to do.
bad service, but the food was good.
watch out if you get mark.
it let up on trying to sell you an upgrade.
it's very long waits.
terrible car service !
drivers are over worked .
cars are terrible !!
go with a different service .
man i wish this place didnt exist!!!!
food was ok at best.
just wanted a simple diner breakfast, eggs,hb,sausage biscuits and gravy.
i received my order in about 2 minutes probably because it was already made.
it was lukewarm and mostly bland.
there just wasn't anything that would make me want to return.
during my visits at absolute dental i never seen the same dr twice.
i was only aware of this once i did my annual credit check.
if you have children you do not want to go here.
it was uncomfortable and rather rude.
the daisy cafe is right down the road is is very kid/family friendly.
the food at the blue plate is mediocre at best and atmosphere stinks.
nothing to see here folks, move along.
this is one of the worst malls i've ever seen.
there is nothing worth coming here for.
even the food places in the food court are lackluster.
this hotel isn't worth the discomfort and poor customer service.
hampton charged $10 more night than what i was originally quoted.
i am disappointed at this location.
i think this time will be my last at this location.
it was disgusting.
would give this place zero stars if i had that option.
#1 - terrible service #2 - dirty for a restaurant.
at least their fried food is made with fresh ingredients.
their automated phone system hangs up on you and they don't care.
the service was so-so.
we had to track down the waitress to get a water refill.
no other drinks were refilled.
a side of macaroni & cheese the same size was $2.
we questioned the waitress, but she said that's just the way it is.
the chicken tenders and a side of macaroni & cheese was $11.
the food was decent, but way overpriced.
we will not be returning.
i was very disappointed in the food and the band was terrible.
they didn't even know the correct lyrics to the song.
i wouldn't dine here again or recommend it to anyone.
i've stayed here many times before.
the front desk staff was friendly and efficient.
but the room was horrible.
there were stains on the bedspreads- so i was uncomfortable about what was underneath.
my sons bed was the same.
did i mention that the mattress was lumpy?
came here to get some headphones for my piano.
too bad because the selection here looks amazing.
customer service/  the parking people are rally rude.
the area is going down.
the parking lot was not very safe.
there wer people casing cars and the patrol would not respond.
not a good place for a single lady.
my wifes meal was all wrong.
lasagna was filled with some form of ground meat.
would not eat here again in you paid me
food was good!
the waitress (vanessa) was horrible!
was not attentive, not sarcastic, just rude...
there is a line and she crossed it to me...
didn't have fun with the experience...
she was bit involved and didn't seem to enjoy her job.
disappointed that we found this in vegas of all places!!!
will not come back to this location.....
so disappointed,food was ok very pricing i was expecting something better!!
but he i did charge in the bills!!
so manager was back and forth checking if we ordered or not.....!!
so be careful!!
this can't be cool with the health department.
staff did nothing!
too bad yelp requires a rating otherwise it would receive -5 stars.
this place is a joke of a property.
i was verbally threatened by my roommates and yet nothing was done.
it got to the point of feeling so unsafe that i moved out.
this place is so terrible they couldn't even pay me to live here.
so happy to be out of the property.
signing a century link contract is like throwing money down the toilet.
working on immediately canceling my service with them.
quite possibly the most disappointing taco bar ever.
looked promising on the outside.
we loved this concept at joyride tacos but not so much here.
this place has terrible customer service.
it's the diamondbacks on all the tv's ( of which they have many).
the will not change at customer request.
we were less than impressed, to say the least.
it took extremely too long just to place the order.
the food was lukewarm and mediocre.
the service was friendly but lacking in knowledge or urgency.
we will not be returning.
oh my god, tell me this place was just having an off night.
and i only had a couple of questions, t'boot.
i can only imagine how they'd handle a real problem.
in my opinion, i would not recommend this company.
now you cant use any cards because the news said this wendy's was breached.
so use cash or go elsewhere.
i like burger king !
this is the worst shop ever.
they charged me so much and my scion is now messed up.
prices are unfair.
tried to pull the old "bait and switch" pricing tactic on me.
how is that a special?
it's a no-brainer.
why would i pay more for less service?
terrible experience today!!
the certificates expire within a couple days so not very long to use them.
this place is a joke when it comes to rewards.
rc willey is way better, nicer people, and way better prices.
guess that's why on here they have 2.5 stats
the table next to us waited 20+ minutes just for a side salad.
service was severely slacking
very sad, i was there sunday late afternoon and there were no dancers?!
girls didn't show up until after 8 ...
and i only saw 3?
so, don't ever go there on a sunday.
waste of money.
waiter was half dead.
food was sub par.
we both ordered the biloxi fried chicken sandwich.
won't be coming back and now reconsidering if we should try andiron.
screw edge fitness!!!!
thanks a lot!
do not eat here!
i would question their sanitation and cleanliness if i were you!
the service is awful.
just got up and walked out.
they have tuesday specials and i guess they were overwhelmed.
wouldn't recommend it unless you're desperate.
go to phat burritto it's close by.
has a confirmed 8-12 appointment.
never showed up!
waited 4 hours and i did not even receive a phone call.
better think twice about calling them when it is 110 degrees outside
this place is out of business.
went december 24 and doors are locked with for lease sign.
another fatality of the economy.
the owner is rude.
staff was rude.
only had smoking rooms.
tried to add on extra for parking.
not a good place.
if you are british and/or black, don't spend your money there, they hate us.
as much as we frequent this panda express it has taken a nose dive.
and her portions were not consistent.
my daughters food was missing the orange chicken.
not driving all the way back so they can make it right.
next time  we'll go somewhere else
have not had a problem with any department except for the vein surgery dept.
i find most of the people that work here are rude.
i am shocked as most global stores are pretty good.
not this one.
you could not even pay me to go back to this store.
i'm sticking with iwtp
i stood at the counter for 20 minutes being completely ignored.
i continued to be ignored.
i then left without gelato extremely frustrated.
what a waste.
i will never go back.
avoid this place at all costs they will try to take advantage of you!!!!!!
when i checked my bank account a few days later i was charged $59.
overall i would rate it utterly disgraceful out of 10.
they had a giant happy hour sign outside the door and in we went!
but that bait and switch sign outside didn't mention that.
bloody mary's and mimosas were the only hh things on sunday.
what the heck?
we drank and paid and bailed.
this place must have changed owners.
it used to be my favorite chinese place to order from!
now, it is 100% garbage.
we ordered food for four and they only got one order correct.
this is all not to mention that half our order was missing!
please do not eat here!!
i would hate for anyone to waste their money and risk food poisoning.
i have to say architecture is the star here ...
but why such high ceilings for the prices?
when it still wasn't working i scheduled a third appointment with them.
very unprofessional and did not get the job done.
would not recommend!
ordered:  pad thai & pad kee mao.
buppha thai is most authentic.
great location but terrible association.
their board is terribly aged with very little to do.
i'm not coming back to this panda express.
my son got his hair cut there tonight and the lady was a joke!
i rate this 4 middle fingers up..
this female really pissed me off!
thanks fredericos, i shit my pants for two weeks because of your carne!
:) just like taco bell did me a couple years ago.
ambience is nice, and staff is very friendly.
that's about all i can say positive about this place.
it's very pricey (one chicken breast is $5).
sales man was so rude!!
the rudest i've ever met, told me that i was dumb and stupid.
i'm not happy with it at all!
terrible arrogant service.
very nonapologetic about forgetting to place an order.
was not even a busy time
bad operational service...
they need to re-evaluate their processes and staff
their customer service is the worst.
if they were the last resource for travel, i'd stay home.
do not deal with this company if you want to avoid frustration!
staff unapologetic and really just slinging overpriced burgers.
got 3 burgers and 3 fries was about $35.
i will not be back.
never going back.
went on easter sunday at 11:00, restaurant was empty.
several hostess's, never said hi only said it's a 10min.
wait, no smile just rude.
he said no idea because they were ready.
very unhappy hostess's for this high priced restaurant.
waiters are always very nice.
honestly, this mall is pretty bad.
seemed really run down and empty, so many stores were closed down.
this place is disgusting.
burger king serves up a better hot dog than this dump.
and it smells like donald trump's toupee sweat inside.
very, very unacceptable service at the auto service part only.
currently, i'm in the process of complaining to the general manager.
i promise , its worse than jack in the box tacos.
they should be shami to sell thay mess.
pissed to know people eat that and or not warned about it.
their license should be revoked!!
the prices are expensive and they don't have gelato out of all the flavors.
going to baskin robbins from now on
waste of time and unacceptable.
what a disaster!
they planned for 10,000 and they had over 70,000 on sunday.
the place was mobbed everywhere.
such a fiesta you wouldn't believe
do not book with them!
so, i called flight network and they said the original ticket had sold out.
that's totally unacceptable and false advertisement.
i would never recommend them to anyone.
my son didn't want the egg on his sandwich so i ate it.
me and my son both ended up getting food poisoning.
i contacted the mcdonalds and they didn't show that they cared at all.
i made a reservation online for a pick up at cleveland airport.
i received an email confirmation regarding time, date, etc.
i would not use this company again.
went to buy a printer.
what really pissed me off was the service attitude.
none of the tags were correct for the printers.
customer service is the worst i have ever seen.
no one smiles.
will be taking my business to amazon.
hmmmm....looking at my reviews i noticed this was all wrong so here's my update.
i'm so sorry if i misled any patrons that ended up not happy.
i cannot speak to their repair work.
their est on a $1200 lens was $500.
they suggested i send it to the manufacturer and i did.
amazing that it turned out to be a free, under warranty repair.
i could never trust cris to provide an honest quote ever again.
i'd always feel as though i over paid.
so sad to have had a bad experience at pullman.
the welcome was chilly.
we brought a candle from a nearby table.
sad opener to a delightful stay in usually friendly montreal.
i have been renting from hertz for the last 10 years.
if all possible, use another agency.
they do not value their existing customers.
i'm never ever going to this place ever again.
what an overpriced shame of an establishment.
this has to be the biggest joke.
i drove around and the  store is completely empty.
this was easily one of the worst dining experiences of my life.
highlights include the following:  1.
slow, inattentive service with very few customers there.
inedible food, bearing little resemblance to anything of any quality from argentina.
the bottle of malbec was good, if that was any consolation.
easily amongst my five worst dining experiences.
make sure to check your receipt.
what a laugh!
once again it was a big joke!
$55 , that's wtf..
sorry we have bladders not sorry dude.
i'm very disappointed.
somewhere on the edge of p.e.i!?
then the foolishness about not taking tables more the four or seven - really!?
i will not bother ever trying to eat here again.
worst indian food i have ever had in life !!
no taste !!
it all about waste of money and time !!
we arrived in cleveland at about 10p and needed to ear.
we ordered margaritas.
time for sammy to retire.
i show up for the appointment and i'm told tim is off today.
this is similar to my complaint with the scottsdale location.
they have plenty of vehicles that they do not want to sell.
the food was so bad i couldn't eat much of my meal.
sauce of any kind would've been welcome for even a hint of moisture.
another off-putting aspect: the diet coke was un-drinkable.
once again, two sips then i was done.
disgusting place overall.
won't be back.
worst flower place i have ever dealed with.
husband sent me flowers on the 12th, never received them.
that really pisses me off.
they didn't offer anything or ever say sorry.
never going to order from this place again, wast of money.
server treated us poorly, the food was honestly cold and stale.
i felt awkward and uncomfortable the whole time.
we won't be back.
fish was over cooked and dry and over priced.
there were 3 of us eating.
2 of us got sick afew hours after.
i've never felt as violated or as victimized as i have here.
i've never felt as much like trash as i have since i've been here.
if i could post zero stars i would.
i have never seen such immaturity in a person while at work.
we were awed by the entire experience.
had an appt.
not a place for asian people who knows what japanese ramen taste is like.
one of the worst ramen ever in my life....
i want to leave 0 stars at this establishment.
it was for 2 large pizzas 2 liter soda and 2 cheesecakes.
i was pissed!
i bought it so you have to honor it.
they refused and he offered me 10% off my pruchase.
i wanted to deck him in the face.
upon sitting down and ordering, waited 45 minutes for food.
cold food, cheese was "melted" way before we got our table.
staff not friendly.
don't waste time.
beer was good.
i do not recommend.
i should have read all the reviews before making an appointment.
nothing was done.
their system said i had been called and i was  not.
i walked out with my hair still dump,very  mad and $300 lighter.
i will never go there again,what i rip off and dissapoitment!
zero star for me!
they are thieves.
they do not apply normal vegas rules.
dealers are shady and will purposely mis-deal to take your money.
i will never go back.
i would give zero stars but it's not an option.
poor food- i just had a $10 sandwich from rosso.
the chicken was cold, a pathetic lettuce leaf was draped over the top.
it was like a gas station sandwich.
save yourself $6 and buy a  sandwich from the esso around the corner.
the only thing our meals had in common was the beans.
i also reported it with the southern las vegas health board.
ew.& i'm not even going to waste my time talking about the service.
the girl working the register was super rude.
when i asked why it's this way the asian woman told me it's enough....
lol never again..
and they don't even have different varieties of sauces to choose from!
i even had to pay extra for avocado on a veg burrito!
we choose them based on the 5 star rating which is obviously not reliable.
felt horribly  deceived!
i would never use or recommend.
i have the pick 3 with catfish and double oysters.
and it came with two sides.
which didn't come out until 10 mins after the fish and oysters?.?.
it had blue cheese and cooked red peppers which is not normal.
and when i let my waitress know that i didn't like the salad.
she did nothing.
i will never come back.
service was cold not a welcoming atmosphere.
here now for our mothers 83rd birthday party.
guess they don't want our hundreds of dollars in business.
my mother-in-law's assets were very compact.
many friends and family learned hard, informative lessons through this.
the very situation we paid to avoid turned into a nightmare at  $10k !
please do yourself a huge favor,  get someone you know and trust.
at least do your own research before signing up.
a very stressful year after losing someone we all love.
please run away, far far away!
horrible customer service wait time is way to long.
they need better employees running this place.
will take the extra time to go to home depot or lowes.
what do you mean?
this particular harris teeter must have the worst management team ever.
ever since they opened they have been a disappointment.
i think i'll drive a little further and spend my money somewhere else.
chicken was dry.
over cooked and the honey mustard wasn't honey mustard like us southerners expect.
and well the prices are big 28 for a burger and strips combo.
that my fly in connecticut but it def won't here.
so props on good service and management but and f for cost and quality
enjoyed guy's show immensely, unfortunately this place was less than stellar.
menu was limited.
the food was extremely over salted.
the vegas nachos had salty blue cheese with salty wing sauce.
i also ordered the wings which tastes the same so it was salt overload.
this was the absolute worst menu i have ever seen.
cesar salad was drenched i'm dressing and my lettuce was soggy.
this guy started to get to personal about religion.
don't tell me about your religion and question mine fool.
completely cold shwarma with brittle and dry pita bread.
hole in the wall establishments are my all time fave, this place however....
beans were reheated and you could taste it.
chilaquiles were salty.
soda was flat.
yelp disappointed me with this one.
well for my first time here i was way less than impressed.
i guess bloomfield bridge tavern or mrs.
t's is still my go to place.
and plus this place is way out of my way to be treated poorly.
i wouldn't go back
it keeps the kids occupied in various age ranges.
however, angelica ruined that experience.
she was rude, not only to me, but the children i was watching.
i'm currently a member at revolution mma.
they keep on charging your credit card with no way to cancel.
how's that for scam!
i was unable to install it myself.
so he went and got them.
guess what, i am now charged $60 for an installation fee.
i'm calling my credit card company now and stopping all service.
went to see angela derosa a few years back in the scottsdale office.
i do not personally recommend this woman.
never go to this gym!
they kick people out!
i had a bad experience here.
the head "massage" was so rough, i had tears coming down.
the actual blowout was ok at best.
overall, was not pleased at all.
well long story short, it burnt the amp 2 months after!
never again will i go there for any car audio system items!
what did they do to the inside?
the remodel completely disappointed me.
they gave me a plate of nachos with some toppings and eggs.
very very disappointed.
don't waste your time.
i had dinner yesterday, good service but the food is awful.
i got lobster ravioli..
very thick ravioli, the flavor of the zafron was just too much.
i will not recommend it if u want to taste a good lobster ravioli
bad hard seats!
over priced, mediocre coffee!
this place - not for me
then i sit at the bar and felt completely invisible.
i walked out and nothing was said to me.
simply disrespectful staff.
tottaly fail .....
the make and the put a few chips and guess what else ....
btw i ask for ni frijokes ...
to hard of a tasks.....
they changed their original menu, and not good.
can't imagine they will last another year now!
time to find a new favorite place!
won't ever go back.
never seen a company vehicle cut so many people off before.
disaster-had to just leave.
we just decided to leave.
morning crew was 50% nice and 50% just rude.
service is still rude and incompetent.
they gave me a green tea???
plenty of other nice and friendly coffee shops in the area!
i was very fooled by the pictures i order pad see ew..
totally not worth it by far the worst subway ever, can you say ghetto!!!
went in today to get a star wars balloon for my sons birthday.
it was taller than your average balloon.
grand total for one balloon $30.
i won't be coming back here.
awful experience last night with a server who had a major attitude problem.
the restaurant's food isn't even that good to have a stupid policy like this.
this is by far the worst run medical practice in the state of nevada.
go somewhere else.
this place is not at all what they say it will be!
they say it's free but i knew that wouldn't be the case.
i lost my weight but never got my money back.
naan was the only good thing..
and for which we had to wait so long...
not much options in the buffet...
don't choose this place.
it was very ridiculous.
i wish i could upload the video on this incident.
i'm disappointed with the wait time and quality of food.
waited over 15 mins for my sandwitch.
i've ordered take-out for a soy hot chocolate and egg salad sandwitch.
the sandwitch was overpowered by pepper.
the hot chocolate has a large lump of chocolate at the bottom.
if i'm paying $6 more then it would cost me @starbuck/second ...
they could at least stir it fully for the chocolate to melt.
no repeat customer from my end.
i ordered through ubereats and was extremely disappointed.
they pride themselves on the quality but nothing i ordered was good.
this place is extremely over-priced for the horrible food it produces.
do not order from here!
i only review when things go really good or things go really bad.
unfortunately, with gps city things are really bad.
if you want to return an item, restocking fees are through the roof.
they range from 20% to 50% of the product.
i will not be buying anything from them again.
because it was a tuesday afternoon and he was alone without his own gun.
the worse full set i have ever got!!!!!!
just had them done 10 minutes ago.
it was $60!
you'll be sorry if you have this lady do your nails.
bleh...the girl cooking the crepes was not good.
like other reviews the strawberry crepe came out doughy and raw tasting.
no crispness at all.
i ordered a banana nutella, wasn't even warm.
banana was cold and no "melty" nutella.
this place will go down vv the tubes auper quick.
they need a true crepe chef or else.
food was so so, but service was dishonest.
the house special tofu was not made with fresh ingredients.
the meat was brown, old and a bit tough.
we will not be back and would not recommend this place.
my wife and i and two small kids.
it's like they cared more about the dine-in customers more than the to-go orders.
i took my camry in to scott clark toyota for a state inspection.
two hours later i again asked for a manager to call me.
four hours and no response.
food is ok...
but the service.....
either they are very blunt...
either they don't speak french....
and they answer your in another language then yours....
or it is soooo cold in the restaurant....
a big disappointment after visiting this place.
green tea ice cream taste horrible.
hope they can improve it.
i ordered a cake as i have every year at this time.
quality has gone way down.
other years the decoration and presentation was great.
this year it was bland.
definitely not worth $70.00.
they must have had a change in artists and bakers.
the food is amazing but the service is sooooooo bad !!!!!!
the owner has got to hire more staff omg!!!!
it is to busy and they can't fill the orders.
you just sit and sit and sit.
please fix this the food is so good.
these guys are not right.
how they keep getting away with their crooked ways are a mystery.
i love the look of this place but nothing else really.
i ordered 1 scoop of strawberry ice cream and it barely tasted like strawberries.
also it was close to $7 for one measly scoop in a waffle cone.
i would never come back here again.
the extra star is for customer service.
the guy who helped us was very friendly.
front desk receptionist shirley cost me money!
my hair appointment was for 11:00.
i was early because of a client meeting before noon.
didn't make my video-conference meeting because of traffic and lost a substantial consultant billing.
whoever owns this place ought to take a survey!
this bar is great for smokers.
this is a typical bar with a few games built into the bar.
nothing exciting here!
and it's not just this location.
we were in town for a bachelorette party.
the maid of honor made a reservation two months in advance for 16 girls.
instead of being apologetic they argued why it wasn't ready.
it was terrible experience and it ruined our dining for the bride.
i was reschedule two more times.
let me leave unhappy and without a care.
to be fair, this particular review is specifically about their grilled cheese sandwich.
first of all, apparently if you don't specify,  they use american cheese...
maybe i'm just spoiled....
the cookie that came with it was good.
quicken loans are crooks.
pulling credit reports without authorization.
will never be back, didn't even go back to get them fixed by them.
but they've basically just let this place go to shit.
what a dump.
i took one bite of the grape leaves and spit them out.
the rice was gooey and slimy.
it was beyond gross.
customer service here is very judgmental.
i walked right out.
otherwise, expect to be shunned.
my first and last visit to this place!!!
we were looking for feeder mice for our arizona native ground snake.
i walked out of that store mid conversation.
that worker was rude and very disrespectful.
after eating at plenty of great places around vegas, this place was absolutely disappointing.
- service was horrible.
water was warm, server was inattentive, sour cream was liquid.
wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.
do yourself a favor and keep walking.
no better luck.
customer service just killed any chance of me ordering from here.
no rental available even though reservation was made a week in advance.
no email, no text notifying.
after waiting 45 minutes we ubered.
spend the extra 10 bucks a day and go with a reputable company.
dooooo not go here.
they will literally take your money.
finally, my total came to $8.20.
she came back and gave everyone else their cards and walked away!
she still owed me $2 and she just took them!
never going back!
this is the 3rd time this has happened and this is unacceptable.
i would like some sort of refund from your business for these problems.
i would never recommend this dealership.
i had a horrible experience with a salesman named frenchy.
he was very unprofessional and at times rude.
i would never recommend this dealership to anyone, namely the salesman named frenchy.
i would not recommend anyone to this insurance company!!
dismissed us and when back to his office.
we didn't even receive an apology.
since again, this man is a regular customer and will be back.
oh this month is a guaranteed win it's tax month.
wish i could give this place zero stars.
horrible customer service, nobody at the front.
yes that's right, a pizza with no sauce......and breadsticks instead of cheese sticks!!!
went to address listed here, nothing there but empty suites.
i love their food but the service is pretty bad.
waited for 30mins for a crepe and a side.
when i checked with other staff they told me she was in fact lying.
so pretty disappointed with the staff but love their food.
will probably try somewhere else next time
worst dining experience ever.
i am attaching the bill here for you to have a look!
a long wait but they were very nice about it.
they don't use sterilized instruments and the paraffin tub was gross.
it was 70 for a pedi and a shellac manicure.
my shellac started chipping that same day.
the next day two more chipped.
hands down the worst shellac manicure i have ever received.
they had to remake it..
this place is the worst..
not coming back here anymore..
the gravy wasn't hot enough to melt the curds.
you can get better poutine at swiss chalet even....
take your time and give your client something amazing.
i wish all these shops would go out of business.
wake the hell up and know what true quality is.
i honestly wish we could give this business 0 stars.
they are a joke.
she then proceeded to tell me the technician could "maybe be there at 1:30".
what a joke.
pathetic excuse for a business i would never use them
tried this with my boyfriend after he recommended it.
i got biscuits and gravy and i was vastly disappointed.
they should tell you it's deconstructed biscuits and gravy.
so a puddle of gravy with a heavy biscuit and eggs on top.
served with a dirty looking wilted carrot and piece of broccoli like why?
he got the steak and eggs and he wasn't impressed.
probably won't return because the food just isn't anything special.
the lady that answered the phone when i called was horrible!
i will never go to this nationwide again!
they don't even deserve 1 star!
there is no "advantage" in renting a car from advantage.
worst decision ever!
i would have gladly paid that to get going with my vacation.
the shuttle service to the mccarran rent-a-car center is  top notch...
there is always a shuttle waiting in the lane, and never any waits.
i wish advantage would take a page from their book on efficiency.
this place is a joke.
its not the lab techs that are slow its the front desk.
3 hrs later simple blood work was done.
thats not acceptable.
front desk staff is very rude will not answer your questions.
if the front desk staff would get their crap together, it would help.
way too many people waiting hours to be seen.
worst lab corp i have ever been to.
if i could give a 0 star i would.
this place sucks!!!!
the atmosphere was sketchy and the food not quality.
seriously this dude needs to be fired...
my wife and i frequent this bar on regular basis.
we never had the (mis)pleasure of meeting the "owner".
unfortunately, we had the misfortune of meeting him last weekend.
we came in and mistakenly sat to close to his seat.
he proceeded to berate us and make a big production about where we sat.
this place will not get one more dime from me.
it's a shame because the bartenders there are very cool, i will miss them.
maybe he should drink at home, instead of driving his customers away.
i wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone.
don't waste your money by going here.
i was promised great value and tasty dim sum by several of my colleagues.
too many good dim sum places in toronto.
i can say the place is cleaning,that's about it.
food cold as the pop.
the manager yelling.
i'll head the other way to poppeyes, on loraine road.
came in at 1pm on monday  (today).
waited forever to be served.
waited 45 mins for cold stale fries, gross soup and tater tots.
and they were slow!
also had attitude coming off of staff.
disappointed i wasted time here.
also i am watching a lady try to find someone so she can pay.
plenty of slacking staff and not busy...
would give zero stars if possible.
these children couldn't have been older then mine.
the reviews for this place are horrible and there is definitely a reason why.
steer clear of this overpriced dump if you care for your children.
the dough on my calzone was raw.
the cheese not being melted should have been a sign.
i asked for a slice instead, and that dough was raw too.
i didn't think to much of it, just thought maybe it was undercooked.
couldn't finish either and starting throwing up right after eating.
why i give 1 star.
so i won't be ordering or trying anything from here ever.
poor customer service is a killer.
the hubby and i came here after seeing a movie.
i ordered a burger with a red ale, nothing fancy, just simple.
i got sick from my meal.
thanks a lot, lazy dog!
i would give zero stars if i could.
i was followed around the store, and wasn't even asked for help.
the employees are rude, and for their prices, i would shop anywhere else.
don't get the boba here, i beg of you.
it is awful and you will regret wasting your hard-earned cash on it.
go to asiatown and get one at koko bakery.
you will thank me).
food is also not good.
a chinese restaurant can't mess up lo mein, right???
well, this place's lo mein wasn't good.
flavorless and ugh.
csu students deserve better chinese food options.
deserve zero stars.
guy was very rude.
and no ridiculous "hold" on my funds.
payless rental car = worthless rental car
awful experience here tonight.
long wait for mediocre food at best.
the tea tasted like dishwater.
i've been to other chili's locations and had excellent service and food.
my husband ordered ribs which are an up charge and was given 4 ribs.
my fajitas were burnt and bland.
save your money and eat elsewhere!
i wish i'd read the reviews first ....
i agree there should be a 0 star rating option.
i had already placed my order at this point.
both tables' food came out together.
my turkey bacon was freezer burned & terrible.
1/2 my home fries were hard & burnt.
if you are a smoker, you will love this place.
all others, stay away!!!!
this is one of the restaurants in nevada that ignores the clean air act.
the waitresses wear nothing but their underwear, so this place is not for kids.
who serves coors, blue moon and cider at a mexican taco festival?
no mexican beer?
what the hell?
$6 for a crap beer and you have to eat standing up!
don't waste your time.
the lines were feeding the wrong way.
the guy said they didn't do this.
they charged me $90.
you don't have privacy.
your in a room full of people.
the "vip" room is a stupid little room.
would never go back.
i didnt want to leave a tip.
not worth it even if it is a cheaper flight.
worst flying experience of my life.
flight delayed hours and issues at takeoff.
he found it - listed by todd crockett.
on the market for greater than 400 days.
well - it's no wonder why.
the home is not a $1m.
it's a modest 1400 sqft ranch in a sweet little neighborhood in parma/seven hills.
apparently not enough digits in it for him to pay attention to.
he is not helping the howard hanna brand - that's for sure.
i've given this place three tries and now i'm done.
burgers came out barely warm all three times.
will not be returning.
then, without going into details, dr vesna violated patient confidentiality.
so we left and are now seeing another doctor we trust.
service was poor and food was worse.
portions were lean.
interior decorating was high end but layout was labyrinthal.
this is an honest review of my experience.
i hate this walgreens pharmacy!!!
slow, rude pharmacy techs!
and there's always a long "a" line.
im thinking of calling my refills to the other one waaaaay across town.
cause i really don't like this one.
corner of happy and healthy my ass!
overpriced crooks; being charged for unauthorized work.
it took more than 2 hours to get my food delivered to the palazzo.
the sour soup tasted very fishy and bland while the shrimp was burnt.
i would not recommend this place.
after $9000 paid i was told my son needed braces again.
they accused him of not wearing his retainer which he always did.
and, then they said he needed braces for another $3k.
well, let me see, it wasn't my son making the payments.
closed down sometime in the recent past...
was super excited to try this place after reading all the rave reviews online.
peeked inside, and sure enough, the dining room looked like it's being taken apart.
pretty disappointing - shame it went out so soon when it looked so promising.
my speaker in the door wasn't hooked back up.
i don't recommend anyone to bring the vehicle here.
first time eating at this location.
when we took a couple of bites we knew the food was not fresh.
the food was cold, the chicken was saggy and soaked in oil.
never coming back again.
this place runs line a car dealership.
the salesman has to go back to his manager to wheel and deal.
it's a scam.
and the quality is very poor.
i'd shop else where.
i had a great experience with this company until this morning.
the technician gin was kind and polite.
he performed an amazing job.
my price was fair comparing with other companies.
everything was working fine when he left.
not worthy of even 1 star!
i drop it and proceeded to order my simply small coffee, still puzzled.
unfortunately, the staff (non-instructors) here are severely incompetent, in particular the sales manager.
the manager said verbatim, "mam, i can't build you a bigger room.
their employee told me the room was larger and with a king bed.
that's two employees from the hotel that gave me wrong information.
i guess reservations mean nothing.
i'd give them a zero star, but it's not an option.
poor customer service.
i requested no carrots and no celery in my dish.
i won't be back.
seeing dr. paige was an extremely disappointing experience.
it wasn't until then that dr. paige finally came into the room.
not a call, text...nothing.
horrible customer service.
everything is about 8 times harder than it needs to be.
have to call multiple times to have order changed.
delivery company they use is awful.
honestly the worst shopping experience i have ever had
i should have checked the box before i got home.
i ordered for pickup.
i literally counted 10 fries.
i was so hungry and too pissed to go back when i got home.
extremely disappointed with the sky pointe location.
not very friendly not very helpful.
yes they did answer my questions and they do have some great products.
sorry folks i can't give you a good rating on this one.
i would rate in the negative range if i could.
even though we'd called ahead.
it felt like an interrogation,  rather then a fun family outing.
the popsicles seemed freezer burned, and not a lot of flavor.
was pretty excited about this place, such a bummer.
maybe we were there on a bad day.
i don't think they will be in business for very long.
so now the director of operations emails me to email her about my review.
it's ok director!
personal service is the way to earn business when it comes to this industry.
you'll be closed soon...
up until tonight we ate here weekly.
maybe 1 star was too high a rating come to think of it.
nail services felt very rushed, and not relaxing at all.
not going back.
instead they tried to use the fundraiser to run their marketing campaign.
talk about giving your corporation a horrible image.
the estimated loss of charity donations from this is over $5k.
good job la fitness, keep up the selfish greedy business practices.
this location is always short staffed so thomas steps in to cashier.
he is clearly miserable in doing so and makes everyone aware!
save your money !!!
just terrible never coming back
if you don't like your job go mow a lawn or clean a house!!!!!!!!!!!
i am by far very disappointed from this place.
i waited for a couple months.
i deserve a call back.
yes we can do this for your or no we cannot.
not just silence.
that is not how you treat people.
it would be a zero star if it was just for me !
i went back tonight with an appointment.
just the worst customer service ever.
they disgusted me so much there that i'm reconnecting my old samsung galaxy !
don't go there!!!!
this was our first visit to rumfish grill and it will be our last.
despite being very uncrowded (on mothers day!) service was incredibly slow.
when the food finally arrived an hour after arriving, it was lukewarm and tasteless.
requests for condiments were ignored.
good luck guy !
unacceptable customer service from their online representative.
was told i could pick up my shoes the same day in store.
very frustrating to be told everything is good to go and then it's not!
i like supporting local canadian chains however this specific location sucks.
every single time i come here the wait time is ridiculous.
i will never ever be back.
very poor customer service.
i left messages 4 days in a row..
good luck to get them to honor their warranty..
nobody ever calls back from the warranty department..
finally a nice lady in the appliance area helped us out.
bad customer service.
do not go here!!!
i don't think that she knew what she was doing.
she didn't even look at my tongue.
i have had a lot of acupuncture.
what kind of customer service is this?
i ordered a shrimp dinner through grubhub for delivery.
i placed the order at 4:12 pm.
the estimated delivery time was 5:05pm- 5::15 pm.
the order arrived at 6:12 pm.
avoid at all costs!!!
burgers were dry and flavorless.
pulled pork tasted off and very old.
will not return.
i got steak and egg and my husband got the salmon and clam bowel.
all of our food were extremely salty.
almost not eatable!
we won't be back
extremely unprofessional i called for a rx 330 that they had for sale.
wasted my time and energy for nothing.
seems like a incompetent dealership to me.
we just walked out of this place after waiting 40 minutes for our food.
they offered me coffee a couple of times but not my wife.
i'm guessing this is because she had a specialty iced coffee.
my shipment is currently missing.
it's ten days late.
finally, i saw that it said "delivered." i got home to no package.
no accountability, no guarantees, no way to ensure your package will be delivered.
portions were small for the price, and food was bland.
however, when asked to clarify, the bread costs additional.
there are better indian places, avoid this one.
the goal is to open doors, not close them.
machines constantly getting stuck, ball returns don't return.
won't cover plumbing problems.
calls everything 'pre-existing issues'.
won't cover if new policy, even if paid for the year.
i might as well have flushed that money right down the toilet.
it seems the other companies are just as bad.
at least you get competitive rates.
stay away from this company!
the staff isnt trained very well on how to do their job..
will be going to another store from now on.
if your hungry don't come here.
when i got here i waited another 30 minutes.
it wasn't even that busy.
this place used to be customer friendly and the food pretty tasty.
the people who work here should all be drawing unemployment; generalizing????
and finally, it is filthy....no more wasting my time with einstein's here.
worst place ever to rent.
from the outside it's nice but once you move in it's like hell.
once one crawled on me....
talk about nightmares...the staff isn't helpful they charge you for everything.
it was such a hassle.
finally we left and we got a final notice with all these absurd charges.
do not live there!!
decided to try kfc again after years for those $5 meal deals.
don't waste your time you can get better cool other places.
smells terrible inside, we should have turned around and walked right out.
food was not good at all.
my husband and i had some type of food poisoning from there.
will never recommend this place to anyone.
i would never go back there again.
this place is absolutely awful.
after multiple shootings, car break ins, and  terrible trash service.
if you are a young professional or professional at all do not live here.
worst hotel ever.
no ac, my kids are crying, it's disgusting.
stay anywhere but here.
i ordered the falafel platter to go.
my biggest restaurant annoyance is stale rice.
as an added 'bonus', the staff shortchanged me.
we went up to location and ordered to go.
the food was soggy and wet when we got home gross.
the chicken underneath the soggy fried stuff was hard .
you have to do it your self.
i won't be eating there again!
have ordered many times, usually very good.
the cost for two pizzas was 70$.
anyway, cassie b is right, the two fat guys are rude, nasty and ignorant.
the real fat guy that helped me was on his fb page alot.
i got a bottle water, and that was it.
just keep driving past.
i'm sorry to say but bob bradley passed away and this business is closed
the line moves slower than a turtle but faster than a snail.
a few of the instructors were good at teaching a class.
but for the most part this school is a waste of time.
i will give it a zero point if it exists.
bad food, below the average.
we ordered two dishes and they tasted exactly the same!!
food is not fresh either.
don't go, seriously!
the bathroom was really dirty, dusty, and it didn't even have soap.
you toil wonder how their employees wash their hands after going to the restroom.
we ordered one meal and a burger and it came out to $23 dollars.
it was very pricy but my burger was not good.
the meat tasted dry and weird.
i was very disappointed since i was told that this place was good.
i hate paying for overpriced bad food with unsanitary practice.
sandwiches might have been a good idea, but not from canter's!
don't come here.
you should go somewhere else - subway is even better.
very disappointed, now i have to find someone else on short notice.
i don't even get my money back, just living social credit?!
too bad you can't leave zero stars!
seriously, only reason we ate anything past the appetizer was bc we were hungry.
to start, there's no denying beans were straight from a can- nasty!
rice was bland and tasted old.
tacos all together were no good.
seafood tacos: flavors just did not go together at all!
i would've had a better chance at taco bell.
horrible customer service, horrible claims system/department, horrible international service.
use dhl for international shipping, way better, reliable, and less expensive.
that is not true.
we had the vegetarian.
it was terrible.
the best pert was when we added hot sauce to it.
i've been here nearly 10 times.
it's gotten worse and worse.
this last time (4 days ago) i got callus remover as i always do.
the lady that did my feet scraped them until they were raw.
my heels are dark pink.
i used to like this place.
i still recommend the green chili burro.
i ordered an arizona burro that was mostly potatoes and little meat.
the meat was very bland.
i also bit into a piece of bone in the meat.
i will not go back.
called twice to mention that and they didn't even apologize.
actually, they hung up on me the last time.
just terrible service and below average seafood.
we will never return.
front office never sent not one notice.
i experienced the exact same situation at macy c.
when it came to threatening legal action.
( prices much higher than other salons)!
this means you are required to buy 2 drinks and get food.
$8 for mediocre cocktails?
c'mon owners, you can do better than this.
i was at a slot machine.
i got the service button to use freeplay.
i just had knee surgery!
ive been waiting 35 minutes for a drink as well.
as a gold member i would expect better service.
this is ridiculous.
definitely will think twice before coming to the venetian!
the concept is cute, but this place is terrible.
he constantly referred to the kitchen staff as "his mexicans".
there were three of us already served when two more joined our table.
got a dirty, poorly-maintained, small car at an exorbitant rate.
dirty dirty dirty and more dirty!
they should be ashamed at how dirty most of the store has become.
thank god for heinens!
skip this giant eagle if you can!
the cake had red flowers!!!
when i picked it it, the employee said there were no managers.
i've been trying to reach a manager and have had no luck.
it is now 3 weeks and no call back.
worst customer service ever!
save your money and go elsewhere.
sushi arrived and still no tea, no wasabi.
zero tip and zero rating and zero coming back.
not trustworthy, why bother when there are other legitimate places nearby.
whatever you do do not eat here!!
if i could give this place zero stars i would.
beware of this place!!
this place is gross.
very dirty and nasty.
smells bad and is just overall very poor quality.
sorry jambo but i hope you get replaced with a higher quality place.
but the food's horrible...
the table was so busy with paper menus and business cards under glass top.
that i didn't even notice the specials menu tented on top of the table.
i was very excited with my initial consultation, which was a year ago, 2012.
just waited 10 minutes for a table.
we chose to give them additional time to get it together.
don't use them i know there is no other untalented but don't use them!!!!!
the bus driver from pitt  to new york is a horrible person!
i will call the health department and make sure they have a good certificate.
the service was terrible.
there was almost no customers and i waited forever for my food.
the staff all seemed unenthusiastic as well as pretty hungover.
when we got our food and smoothies, it all tasted like rubbish.
this store definitely needs some help!
"c" rating from the health dept.
hanging on the wall....not cool
i have tried his food couple of times..he always disappoints big time.
save yourself the trouble of going to him.
don't waste your time seeing dr. nahkle.
he might be knowledgeable but i never saw it.
his bedside manner is deplorable.
i waited 2 weeks for nothing.
worst experience with a doctor.
i hate that this information is not updated.
yelp, can you be taking businesses down that are not around any more?
worst customer service experience of my life.
you cannot speak to customers that way.
not just "a" name.
the staff were saying terrible things about customers in front of all the customers.
service is really deplorable.
customer service sucked at the bar.
employees didn't seem happy at all.
heard them bitching and complaining by the computer.
over this place.
do not order delivery hour and a half had to cancel
i've had a number of very poor customer service experiences with alaska.
customer service was incredibly rude and unhelpful.
it was insane and illogical.
poor customer service from store all the way to corporate.
will be letting my neighborhood about this awful experience we have had.
the whole experience was a nightmare.
avoid this dump at all costs.
office staff extremely unprofessional.
so i'm sorry if you've ever been stuck behind me because of it.
we were ignored for 20 minutes after arriving at our table.
no one ever came to refill any of our drinks.
i'll get my noodles somewhere else.
food so bad i had to throw it away!
greasy, overcooked, and disgusting textures.
no resemblance to the delicious chinese food i am used to.
don't say i didn't warn you .
i brought my scion in for a recall check on my drivers window.
never had a problem with it since new.
the cost to fix the window that never had an issue.
crooks, thieves, scumbags.
do not trust!
the wait at this office is the worst.
i waited over 1.5 hours to get in and i had an appt.
one star for location only..
in fairness, i did not complain..
did not want to make others feel badly over their suggesting we go there...
afterwards others admitted their fish was mushy as well...
will not go there again...
i had high expectations of this restaurant and was very disappointed.
the tiramusu was good.
i would not return to this restaurant or recommend it.
food quality somewhere between a texas roadhouse/western sizzlin and an outback.
the service was slow, steaks heavily seasoned, and presentation was poor.
horrible experience today and i will not be back.
in addition to the food and service the dining area was filthy.
absolutely disgusting place.
they don't even deserve to get any stars!!
unfortunately this place has changed for the worse!
looked so gross in the styrofoam bowl.
i dared to taste it and regretted it immediately!
it had way too much oregano (who puts oregano in broccoli soup?
pitched it in the garbage and went to tim horton's in the bow building.
worst strip club ever!!!!
woman look very old, like a bunch of grandma's!!!!
will never go back ever again!
discrimination against african americans!
if i could give this place a zero star i would !
ever since dr bill left this place is a joke!
now that dr lisa left it's ever a bigger joke!
i've changed vets and this place won't get another penny of my money!
yes because i changed vets!
well i guess i need to change flea and tick meds too now!
we ordered take out on a busy saturday night.
staff was pleasant and order was ready fast.
worst general cho's chicken we've ever had.
the chicken was spongy and chewy.
super rude to african americans.
i asked to speak with a manager she came and didnt make it better.
bar waitresses made me feel really disrespected.
please don't go here
delivered and improperly assembled a dining room table.
we have called ashley several times to get this table replaced.
been getting the run around for over a month now
we didn't but he mentioned it so i asked if we could get it.
he said not without the coupon with an attitude.
any other place will give you the coupon if they mention they have one.
either that or just give it to everyone.
this place used to be good- last time i went was the last time.
super salty pho not at all flavorful.
by far the worst service we've had in a while.
our service had zero priorities, zero multitask skills, and lacked organization.
we ordered something fast and easy ..simple soup and salad unlimited.
stop half a$%ing your job.
spoiled beer, rude service, and bad location.
wouldn't recommend to my worst enemy.
trust me, steer clear of this dump.
saw a huge roach 10/29/2016 run across the counter next to food.
another diner saw it too, and he informed the cook.
wish i took a picture.
a total waste of time and money.this event had huge lines to get in!!
huge lines to get to tacos!!!
no place to wash your hands!!!
no place to sit down!!!
not to mention most of the tacos were microscopic for the $2 tacos!!
the staff was friendly, i can't complain about that.
how is that even possible?
won't be back since it can't even wash a car, what's the point?
had very bad experience.
girl who did my simple haircut even didn't have proper scissors!
when instructor asked her why she uses unappropriated tool she said hers were stolen.
ok, i understand that happened but my hair shouldn't suffer!
i had to trim it at home myself.
oh well, tough luck.
sadly i had bad experience, no more risking.
probably go to supercuts next time.
great food...but they throw whipped cream in your face if anyone requests it.
no birthday necessary....sorry...not professional..
not a good atmosphere to take the family for dinner.
on top of that the food was not very good....
good place for drinking but that's about it.
i'll go to the supermarket, thanks.
playing at the bar, no drinks comped...really??
mlb playoffs in..no sound???
i asked bartender..
nothing they can do??
all they want is your money.
pretty sad toby...step it up a little...
i wish there was an option to leave zero stars.
but that's not even the worst...
did they not wash the sheets???
so i switched rooms and left with 5 bug bites.
i would never stay here or any extended stay after this experience.
you could not pay me enough $ to stay here.
i am in total disgust .
i got gel and literally the next day it started falling off.
they also cut me and left it they cut me multiple times.
i did not bother to tip them because it was all just bad.
the worker was very rough and kept throwing my hands around.
this place was a absolute waste of money.
not saying that small children wouldn't enjoy it , but it stops there.
save your money and go somewhere else.
womp , womp , wommmmp!!!
i am usually skeptical of hotel food.
this place didn't disappoint.
we stopped here before a show at heinz hall.
thought it was the perfect place because it is right across the street.
it was basically two small tenderloins.
needless to say, we will never eat there again.
the worst service ever!
the sales staff is horribly undertrained, if trained at all.
the managers don't seem to know what's going on.
service is so slow i just want my food!!!!!!!!!!!!
have been waiting for about 45 mins.
pizza was unimpressive and my slice was cold.
but we were hungry so we just chose to sit outside.
we are not planning on returning to this establishment anytime soon.
would never go back again as it's not cheap either.
i need to go to the doctor to get the pus drained out!
they wanted $350 just to get into my engine and give me an estimate.
i went across the street to mr tire and got a free estimate.
horrible is all i can say about this place.
i could not recommend this company less.
the food at in n out burgers are all the same....
the only thing that i can rate is the service.
this location has the highest number of my orders messed up.
whoever is in charge isnt doing a great job.
everytime i come here it seems it's a for sure messup.
from now on im going to avoid this in and out.
i'll probably go eat at other restaurants from now on.
currently still waiting on mail !!!!
never experienced this its people sitting outside waiting  for their mail to come!
this is not the regular person in route
$60 for takeout and i've had better food from the #1 chinahouse.
$4 for mushroom flambe that consisted of 8 sliced up pieces(total rip off).
i would expect more from a so-called 5 star japanese steakhouse.
save your time and money and just go to ichiban.
unkempt and malnourished roses.
as a rosarian i was not impressed.
i don't recommend this to anyone.
worst experience ever.
the service at this restaurant was so terrible!!!
the food was cold and horrible for the prices that they charge.
all around bad experience!
only good thing about this place is they open late.
bad customer service (just servers) especially the guyl.
i been there 5 times cuz there no place to go at night time..
food is below standard..
and they brought out wrong order and was rude .
tuesday lunch closed?
how about updating yelp's hours?
walked 3 blocks to get here.
yelp says open right now.
the worst pizza i've ever eaten!
we were starving and ordered the viva las vegas.
i believe the sopressata was rancid and picked it off.
the crust was gooey and nasty.
my bf loves meats and ate my pieces.
i had much less discomfort which was 12 delay in the resulting surprise.
worse than chuck e cheese!
the cheap beer is the only thing that should be ordered here!
under new management that no longer delivers to our neighborhood.
customer obviously lost, we will never eat here again.
got one filling fixed at the new place for 150 bucks.
do not recommend.
and if you have kids, don't even think about it.
i am not a member of this insurance company.
i am at a total loss and their company has not a moral bone.
this is the worst experience i have ever had.
the food isnt that good, would advice anyone to not come to this place.
she kept leaving during my massage.
we paid for a 70 minute massage and it was less than an hour.
then when we were leaving the lady told me to tip her more.
what a joke.
do not go to this sleezy place.
so many other reflexology joints that are worth it.
and three days later...
i guess they don't need my business!
jenni and elaine sold the business along with the name.
i've been here twice after the fact.
service is nothing like it used to be.
i was there yesterday.
my nails are lumpy and rhinestones and 3-d art falls off.
i've made up my mind, i will never go back.
oh jenni how i miss you!!!!
i wish i could give them a rate 0 over 5.
that is what they deserve.
don't recommandthem to anyone and call them never ever
i arrived at dos gringos for taco tuesday about 9:50 pm.
our party is only five people.
the entire restaurant probably only had 30 people.
the service was absolutely terrible.
none of the members of our party plan to return.
called and asked if an appointment was necessary and was told no.
bad service, guy working drive thru looked like he was in hell.
no communication no thank you whatsoever.
i grew up in cali and did 15 in phoenix.
lived on mexican food.
crab cakes blew!
i suppose if you can't say anything good, don't say anything at all.
margarita was tasty.
big zero, not going back.
walked into a bit ago and got a seat at the bar.
i would love to stay for bbq...
but i'll drink my drink and wander elsewhere!!!
not worth me spending my money and i don't they even care honestly.
talk to tina who's skills match her cake making skills, dry, bland and ugly.
you will be in unqualified hands with her!
steer clear of this place!
the owner is horrible and unprofessional, their cakes are sh*t.
is there no one there smart enough to be certified?
i won't say where i want bank of america to go.
my advice - go elsewhere.
also a big splash of tomato sauce on my salad plate .
this salad was insaulting and disrespectal to anyone .
this truley was one of the worst meals i ever tried to eat .
really clean and pretty salon.
and just have her solid color fingernails.
they were just being lazy and didn't want to do what she asked.
very tiny and kinda unkempt place in a  working class neighborhood.
lots of poor birds cooped up in miserable cages on the patio.
servers nice enough, food fine but really an hour?
not worth the wait, over rated big time.
the wait time will be the reason i won't return.
edited: it's now going on 40 minutes
this may not be a fair review, because i did not stay to eat.
not even the baked goods were different from paradise.
same cookies, etc.
i'm sorry, but are we sheep?
slap a new name on the items?
i don't care for paradise bakery as it was.
panera used to be much better, imo.
i truly hope it's just because they just opened.
my wife and i  came here for a quick lunch and were disappointed.
the breakfast burrito was bland and the mushroom burger was made with canned mushrooms.
it tastes like beef patties drowned in a nacho cheese sauce.
i could barely discern the flavor of the vegies,bun or ketchup or mayo.
it was so rich and greasy that i felt sick after eating it.
the drive through service was quick and courteous as usual.
"fast food" i say not.
slowest service i have ever seen.
and no coffee at 10am.
had to wait so they could make it.
if i could give zero stars, i would.
had reservations, was seated immediately however no one waited on us.
after 15 minutes we left.
3 servers looked at us and nothing.
smiles by hanna is not cheap, but i was happy with their work initially.
the staff are all friendly which makes an office visit much more pleasant.
i was then charged a "discount" to replace the veneers that kept falling out.
i will not return to even try to have them fix it.
better to cut and run.
wish i had been a yelp user before i went there.
i would rate this buffet a zero stars.
i went on a saturday night, the buffet was nearly empty.
the crab legs were either not fresh or had a bit of freezer burn.
the same with the lobster, it was very hard, even when dipped in butter.
the lobster is also miniature.
also, other hotels serve king crab, however, this place did not.
i would strongly avoid dining here, it is a waste.
i don't give bad reviews very often but this place was terrible!
i orderd the beef brisket sandwich and 90% of the meat was fat.
i called the waitress over and she agreed it was not even edible.
she brought me a new sandwich and it had about 50% fat.
i tried my wife's chicken pasta and the food was bland.
you are better off going to the food court and getting something cheaper!
we will be trying out the mcdowell location next!
i placed an order an order and asked for delivery.
the extensions were a dark brown and i went in with already lightened hair.
paid 46 dollars plus tax 53 dollars and got out of there.
i hate to say this but i cannot recommend this place.
i got the worst manicure and pedicure i've ever had there.
the gel started peeling off the very next day and looks awful.
but get this ...
everyones food was incorrectly prepared !!
items were missing , or not the right order ..
omg what a circus !
this was my first time here ..
and what an experience  never again !!
do not buy directly from lorex unless you don't value customer service.
clearly they don't value customer goodwill.
bottom line:  i would never recommend lorex to anyone else.
simply dreadful, dreadful customer service, assuming you can even get in touch with them.
don't use this dry cleaner!!
i took in 6 garments for cleaning.
4 ties, a pair of pants and a sports jacket.
of the six garments only one was cleaned satisfactorily.
one tie had spots that were not removed.
two ties came back wrinkled.
the pants had a double crease and the sports jacket was wrinkled.
the young clerk was totally uncooperative.
i wouldn't take my dirty socks to this place.
dr. vazquez was so, so rude.
wish i could do more than just write a bad review.
avoid this place.
too bad because for that price it should be fresh.
beyond aggravated right now.
buyer beware - your membership is not what it seems to be.
so much for convenience & not paying for more than you need.
the building and the view is incredible.
we were staying at the hotel and went in for breakfast.
we finally just decided to sit down at a table.
the waitress finally came over and brought us coffee.
our visit lasted exactly 5 minutes.
food was ....
i'm sticking to viet noodle though it's always nice to try other places.
hire new security!
he was a complete clown.
even the police told me to call and complain.
called them out after an ac fan failed.
not impressed, draw your own conclusions.
it does not surprise me one bit they went out of business.
they were super nice when i bought a gun from them.
i called them and they straight blew me off.
i had to call the manufacturer - who told me to call them.
all in all the manufacturer fixed it but that was some b.s. ...
they told me to take it to a gun smith....
after i just bought it???
like i said, doesn't surprise me.
they don't have much food to start with...
i will not stay here again...
pretzel dog was soggy and gross.
cream cheese frosting for cinnamon sugar sticks was weird.
other stuff we tried was soggy as well.
probably would love if drunk.
don't ever go to this restaurant!!
bbq is dry.
food is sub-standard.
this is the worst bbq place we ever have!
highly avoid this place!
the service is ok,sometimes horrible.
only $20 ayce korean bbq and so much better than woonam jung
worst service ever.
car hop service is a joke.
workers are more interested in phone than providing good service.
parking can be difficult depending on the time you arrive.
i wish i can rate 0!
worst service and sound!!
 30%   ktv ......
the place looks like it needs to be cleaned.
the fish was old, you could tell because of the smell after eating it.
the fries where okay at best.
please ask gordon ramsay to visit this place, to clean it up.
this is a place of business...not some gathering of the boys in the hood
super rude employees!
i've never had so many dirty looks for arriving a minute before closing.
it's not like i was asking them to cook me a meal.
i was out in 2 minutes and they gave me a hard time.
i'll never return.
to add to the disgrace, the lack of a pleasant employee!
clogged sink and bath tub.
the bed is not made for a good night sleep!!
in general the place is not good.
but i don't recommend staying there!
the service was absolute crap!
instead of taking the dish away she argued with us.
she then proceeded to point us out to the cook.
he looked directly at us and shook his head.
unprofessional is not a strong enough adjective to describe the staff.
be prepared for small dinner plate portions.
if you're on an ethiopian diet then this is the place for you!
the food was edible, but not amazing......
we will not be returning!
the only highlight was that there was no long line to get in.
one of the cheapest buffets at $22 pp on the strip.
the food selection varies from dried and overcooked to tasteless.
would definitely not recommend unless you in the hotel, starving and on a budget.
if you love mimosas, don't go here!
it's 7$ for a shot glass worth of champagne.
not worth it!
wow the managers at this store is hod awful.
they have no clue how to run a store and bad attitudes.
bad customer service.
they won't even help this poor employee who is trying to help customers out.
they are playing rap music in the back ground.
is this a bar or parts store.
steer clear out of this store.
the worst auto zone store ran by bad managers.
bought the tacos and wish i didn't.
tried the shrimp and the carne asada and will never go back.
cheap ingredients in tortillas that fell apart at first touch.
tacos were $4 a piece.
store looks more like a warehouse than a pet store.
employees were rude and unprofessional.
i felt completely uncomfortable the entire time i was in the store.
will never be going back there again.
don't do it!!!!!
can i give zero stars??!!
get ready to be treated like a transaction rather than a patient.
it's like they're all robots.
no one cares if there is an issue outside of their daily standard procedures.
it's as if they will do whatever to charge a patient extra money.
guess they really don't care about their customers.
won't be going here again
when i signed up i said i just wanted to do one month.
the sad thing is after reading reviews this has happened a lot.
obviously they don't care about their customers and would rather just have our money.
well i won't be going back next year.
bad customer service.
their server, rachel, was so rude!!
she kept giving us attitude.
she should learn what is a  great customer service!
the food was great though
there is such a lack of employees here.
flat out rude!
(keep in mind nobody was in line) what!!
hire some more friendly, willing to assist employees.
definitely won't return to this location.
no words could explain how rude several employees were.
i walk in, smile and say hi.
lady at the front ignores me and walks away.
too many better options out there.
infested with millions of roaches!
and the office does nothing about them!
the neighbors are friendly but everything else about these apartments are terrible!
overall stay away from these apartments!!
very bad apartments and probably dangerous for your health with all these roaches..
dewey is not a man of his word.
i would not use this company ever again.
do yourself a favor and use someone else.
over priced and not impressed.
my wife and i both ordered a fillet.
both were over cooked and tasteless.
portions were very small and  just not worth the time or money.
this place was awful!
the water pressure in the shower was bad!
also, my boyfriend left his phone in the room.
we called it and it rang and rang.
we went there to vacation and lost a phone and got injured.
the phone was "found" in some linens and turned on again suddenly.
haven't even tried the food yet.
i'll update when i finally get my food.
made a delivery order through yelp today.
i have to say i'm honestly disappointed.
i chose this place because it had 4 stars.
definitely a lie!
for one, the delivery took forever.
the salad i ordered came soggy.
the pizza was cold.
the only thing that came out right was the soda pop.
.i would not consider going there based on his attitude.
the service department is the worse.
i can stand in front of the counter for 20 minutes.
the staff shuffles papers, moves keys and no one acknowledges me.
i receive the invisible man treatment.
during an oil change, fluids are supposed to be checked and replenished.
for anyone who uses them good luck.
you either have a death wish or are optimistic.
i have tried to complain to management.
no one calls or responds to email.
dissatisfied ordered general tao - it was orange chicken with 3 pieces of broccoli.
the hot and sour soup looked right but did not taste right at all!
just got off the phone with them.
not very nice.
based on his demeanor i will go to bernies.
injured in a car accident.
lost means of transportation.
so long as they have a form, which they won't provide.
what a fucking joke.
not impressed, my pedi was bad.
first time here.
went with wife and kids.
ordered chicago fries, onion rings, western pizza and taco pizza.
the taco pizza had cold sause on the top.
went this am...never again!
well hashbrowns not cooked barely browned and a ton of raw onions!!
and white toast.
they would not even adjust bill....the omelet was luke warm butter wouldnt even melt!!
i would have really like to give this place a higher rating.
the food is good but not worth the terrible service.
they really need to figure out how to get it together here.
next time, i will gladly spend my money at nami instead.
sorry jewels, i won't be back.
i have zero bad things to say about any of the drivers.
they made me feel like an idiot and that is terrible customer service.
i'm very disappointed with the customer service at yellow cab.
by the star i gave it you can see its the latter.
we looked at each other and gave it a visit the trash.
spare yourself, your children, your friends and your wallet from this place.
i dont think so!!!!
why would anyone do that?
please avoid this company!
dont let yourself get in our situation.
this review is solely based on atmosphere and ummmm smell.
bummer that the review is solely based on the service.
totally understand that it is hard to find staff, but wow.
placed the order in the drive thru and the reply was "4 minute wait".
um, well, ok.
i can wait.
total bummer.and after all that....my order was wrong.
your reservation will be worthless.
they just turn you away and say that's what happens when it is busy.
horrible service, don't use or trust them.
well i spent my evening throwing up after i had dinner here.
i went to get groceries & decided  to try their food; bad mistake!!
the staff is rude and very unwelcoming.
this place is cheap and has horrible employees working there!!
if i could i would give this place zero stars!!
my friends who had chicken/steak bowls also felt unwell after eating here for dinner.
wow, what a foul clerk.
started the second shampoo name, another harsh nope.
then she curtly stated they don't carry name-brand products.
i was standing right next to a huge display of matrix biolage products.
matrix sleek was one of the products i was seeking.
i've got no problem with their not having what i wanted.
i've got a problem with the harsh, curt, cold attitude.
what a cheap place, new administration sucks, 3x1 in well drinks is a scam!!!
this kind of bad behavoir is why your place is always empty.
i brought this to the attention of management but he did not care.
me and my family was trespassed from the property.
wtfnegative 5 stars.
lady on her cell phone, fing & gangster attitude.
then she turned her cell phone fing rapping music on.
when order was wrong, she told me it was right.
loli will never go to any mcdonalds again in that type of neighborhood.
needed to be seasoned more.
must be more flavorful.
sorry, i can't recommend.
we had meatballs, sausage rigatoni and tomato soup.
i scheduled a cleaning for a specific time.
they came anyway.
of course it was a mess, i was still working on it.
what a waste.
steer clear of this company.
we had a limo bus with 18 of us in it.
they were 30 minutes late to pick us up then couldn't find us.
disgusting tourist trap.
i would never use this company again.
car wash doesn't even have vacuums.
i've been to this resturant couple times and they did fair job.
today, cobb salad came out with a dead fly.
not happy the experience will not return.
6 of the pumps are not working.
old lady cashier is on her phone and no customer service at all.
won't even try to assist the customer.
their webste evn advertises lower than emergency tom costs.
i went twice with my sin and paid 160.00 more than i planned.
do not go here to save $$$$$
i ordered wings for delivery.
nothing beats biting in to a wing and finding pink/raw meat.
decided to take my family for breakfast.
upon arrival encountered oughty looks from patrons initially and subsequently our waiter.
needless to say, we never ate.
beware of their no retun policy!!!
will neverbe back and make a point to tell others not to either.
i stayed for a week at the hard rock and went here 7-10 times.
there was never once they did.
it screw up an order.
i'm talking serious incompetence.
nearly another 40mins later i finally cancelled my order.
i will never try and order from here again....delivery orders beware!
if i could've given no stars...i would've...
absolutely terrible customer service!
fire her and you'll be a lot better off!
customer service is easy.
smile and do your job ;)
i wish i could give them zero stars.
we are being forced to rent our graduation gowns from them.
this is absolutely the worst company to deal with, hands down.
a terrible, unprofessional business.
no school should contract through them.
front office seems to do almost anythn to keep u from seeing the dr.
i'm havn a hard time findn somethn else, but trust me, i will.
horribly disorganized place, don't even bother!
not realy indian food.
the idea is pretty, the interior is pretty...
the wait staff is nice...
but the food is awful...
the mango lasse and the chai were really bad.
all of the curries were so liquidy...
i got biryani king to cater for a party i had.
so i'll explain what happened below.
was their food good ?
in sum, i wouldn't recommend  biryani kings catering for big events or parties.
don't buy from them!
2.5mnths and we still don't have a green slip.
carlos dodges all calls and is full of lies.
they clear codes out of the cars and hide all warning lights.
if i could i would give them zero stars.
i love supporting beauty schools and cosmetology students and the services are pretty cheap.
don't you guys realize you are the first person everyone sees?
they didn't make a great impression and it'll definitely be the last!
maybe it was what we ordered, but i would not eat here again.
at least the food is better.
non existent customer service on helpline.
if you rent from them be ready for your trip to be ruined.
also watch out for their sneaky contract.
the lack of professionalism is beyond baffling.
any further honda purchases or honda servicing will be done at a different location.
thanks for making my free airbag recall request a very very expensive one.
watch out for this place!!!!!!!!
they told me i needed work done that i didn't!!
the guy was smiling as he told me i needed $900 worth of repairs!!
the repairs i needed done were less than $150!
it's places like this that give shops bad reputations!!!!!!!!!
i really don't reccomend this restaurant.
first of all the service was terrible.
the food was mediocre.
the chicken in my 'pollo rico' tasted just like boiled chicken with no flavor.
i'm pretty sure the beans are canned and they tasted like glue.
the rice is not authentic mexican rice, but was better than the beans.
i can't believe we wasted $45 on this meal, we will not be back.
for biryani i recommend pastries n chaat.
got the boneless chicken biriyani recently.
if you are out of the proper kind of meat then say it.
do not cheat you customers.
so please be careful with this kind of business
worst airline i've ever had the displeasure of flying.
seats are uncomfortable, flight crew showed up 45 minutes after we had already boarded.
worst customer service.
but that opinion was shattered last night.
instead, after verbally assaulting us they complained to gail.
gail then lectured us about how we 1.
were not as important as her other customers 2.
shouldn't speak freely in public.
went friday at 1130am to find it closed....wtf.
you're supposed to be open at 10am or so goes yelp and your website.
lost a local customer.
call ahead before you go i guess even though it says their open.
horrid service, iffy foodny style, pepperoni pizza - bleh.
salad was actually pretty good.
teeniest chicken wings i've ever seen.
delivery only brought part of the order.
took another two hours to get the wings.
then it turned out they charged us 6 times on our card - $150!!!
went to their place twice, called multi[ple times.
still trying to get our money back.
spent $20 for a sandwich, a bag of chips, and water.
but i have to say i was surprised on how fresh it was!
oh my god i got sick every time i ate ate this place.
tasty gyros that made me sick 3 times.
along with our plates and silverware.
if anything they were very rude even.
lotus of siam is sooo!!!
much better but chada thai is open late.
so many other good and clean thai places in the valley...
one of my friends ordered  a wonton soup and general tso's chicken..
bad service, and messed up orders.
not even worth the trouble.
i love mexican food.
this place serves a decent meal and the price seems right.
never will go here again.
do you know what's slower and more inefficient than calgary laboratory services?
if i could leave less than one star i would.
and to finish a still mooing steak on not plate but two.
i will not be back here.
closest to my house but never go there.
wish i can give them negative stars.
i had offered to pay for the rest of the meal.
i am so disappointed, i tried to contact the manager of the palms.
hopefully he will read this.
ordered two bacon egg and cheese biscuits.
seemed like a great deal but they never delivered.
20'minutes later still sitting out front in spot number two they never came out.
what a joke
when i made the appointment i asked for terry specifically.
this is not how haircutting works.
there is trust.
you should know who exactly is going to cut your hair.
if there was only a 0 star out of 5...
the food was mediocre.
the service was scary bad.
guess what he did...
my friends and i are never returning to rifca again.
this is by far the worst car renting experience i have ever had.
took us over an hour to get out of the parking garage.
my daughter was a passenger in a car that was rear-ended.
her cell phone was damaged and could not be repaired.
i give them the next document then usaa denies the claim.
again, i call the supervisor and on and on it goes.
with all of the insurance companies out there, find another company besides usaa.
pretty terrible food!
save your calories for another place...
it was like it wasnt the same doctor.
edit- they tried to fix the situation with a free massage.
i have yet to receive that massage.
ordered the chicken cesar sandwich and man oh man was it a disappointment!
i have never seen such a measly overpriced "sandwich" like this before.
save yourself the $7.50 and go to brick street.
at least there you get your money's worth.
the staff is rude.
you are simply a number.
revenue for them.
a walking dollar sign.
the owners are dismissive on a good day and berating on most visits.
my son was timid and scared of being in a class without mom.
thanks, but no thanks.
rudest people on the planet are all here everybody!
bad food, bad employees, bad decor..
with flies and dirty utensils.
i came across these puppies at the petland in pittsburgh mills mall.
these 3 puppies were there, clearly sick.
eating their own waste, then instantly defecating again.
just google it and read the report.
i cannot believe the horrible customer service of this place.
then when they brought me the food it was something completely different.
all because they didn't deliver the right food to us.
i have never seen customer service so poor!!!
i would never recommend this restaurant to anyone!
customer service is so important.
i agree with a few others who wrote that the drinks are watered down.
if i wanted a cup of ice i would ask for it.
we are not coming back  once you loose a couple you loose them forever.
great idea, poor execution, poor customer service, useless product.
the guy at security was extremely rude and impolite, my recommendation - change him.
won't be going back there, ever.
there are enough better burger restaurants in the vicinity.
never coming back, bad servers, waited for an hour for our food..
when the brought it they didn't give us silverware..
on top of that, everything was expensive
i paid $40.00 per person for the worst buffet in las vegas.
i don't recommend bellagio buffet guaranteed you will be disappointed!
i called my doctor to refer me somewhere else, never this place again.
worst customer service!
we just walked out.
it was square, expensive and completely tasteless.
i can't believe i wasted so much money on this crap.
don't go here, ever.
above and beyond all of this, the tables were nasty and dirty.
i have recently found out about the infractions alberta health has found at jimmys.
rotten tomatoes, unsanitary washrooms and that is just a few.
had dinner with family in town.
had an altercation with chris the manager that turned out to be totally racial.
never been disrespected in that manner from someone that i was paying.
my family spent over 200 dollars.
won't go to that location again.
food is bland.
customer service is awful.
selection is poor.
prices are extremely high for dim sum.
poor customer service!
they put ads in magazines about discounts and then do not honor them.
most importantly they cheat their consignors.
this was so upsetting that i didn't shop there for 2 years.
she was rude and disrespectful.
they are rude and don't care about the patient needs/requests...
it's all business.
give a little!
i go there all the time.
yesterday my van slipped off tracks and was severely damaged.
dented,scratched,and paint chipped.
they said it's not there responsibility.
never go here again they don't know customer service.
i am super disappointed in this place.
we also got the wings, very soggy as well.
if you live in he mesa area stick to bella's!
this place is nothing like the canters in la; don't expect to find that.
red velvet cupcakes: not kosher, lol.
walked in and employee was eating never washed her hands to wait on us.
went to use the restroom it's filthy.
so filthy and grossed out to even use it!
tacos are $2 and comes with hardly any meat!
i will never use this nail salon again!!!!
also, he did not remove all of the dry skin on my feet.
360, yeah you really got it twisted with the name.
the place is 360 and nothing about it is gourmet, more like 360 garbage.
roberto's needs to open a place in this airport and fast.
had parked the car in front of me, parked me.
this took forever.
i spent 4 bucks and waited fifteen minutes.
got an expired coupon for waiting.
so , we came on the bikes on a sat nite .
we ordered pizza and wings combo.
pizza was ok .
it was terrible for delivery.
it was the only thing i was waiting for.
wow they just try to upsale me i was annoyed so i left.
never again real thai on.
the hong kong garden is far was much better.
so why are they using this as a method to diagnose the problem?
they showed up 2 hours late.
one guy went home sick in the middle of the move.
what should have taken them 1.5 hours to load, they spent 4.5 hours.
a lot of our furniture is dinged up.
would not recommend.
they treat their employees horribly and management does not seem to care.
i would rather go somewhere that treats their employees with dignity.
ordered the carne asada fries....
what a huge mistake!
what a waste of $9!!!!
been to way better places that are cheaper and taste way better!
update-i am still trying to resolve incorrect billing issues from 8 months ago.
very disappointed, we will never go back.
i've waited 30 minutes for drive thru assistance multiple times now.
i'm not sure if they are understaffed or just incompetent.
won't be visiting this location any more either way.
perhaps the owners got drunk on their own success.
the ingredients used to make the fish balls have clearly changed for the worse.
service has also taken a dive.
as formerly regular cuatomers we were shocked.
waste of money.
pizza was cold.
wouldn't order from here again.
this saturday morning the earliest available appointment is tuesday at noon.
we were told all appointments are ten minutes...and they just replace units...not actually repair.
i witnessed it again today, and saw it even bring this worker to tears.
so unprofessional, so much lack of care, and so embarrassing for this worker.
i am approaching hr and will not shop at this store.
do not deserve any stars.
food is absurd and disgusting and way too overpriced for the poor quality.
i ordered the dynamite thai chicken.
no wonder pf changs are almost out of business.
don't waste your time going here.
go to teriyaki madness.
i hate cox!
my second broken dvr this year (nothing i did to either of them).
they are racist and will profile you when you walk in.
moments later, same with me.
detained for no reason.
pretty ridiculous that's the only form of payment they take.
won't be signing up again.
the prices are nice.
the food is average, nothing special.
the staff seems overworked but friendly.
too many gnats and flies.
i won't be back.
i went there and it was not open.
i am ill and leaving the house is very, very difficult for me.
for my first review i'm happy to see the place is closed.
i was heading to smash burger next door and noticed the for lease sign.
i hope something new comes in soon.
booooo bed bugs everywhere.
do not live here.
staff here lies and not helpful.
this place is terrible .
i work on the same industry i never seen an  unorganized health facility .
3.- last time i was there, seven people were talking just one doctor working.
we ordered a pizza to our hotel at 634.
no idea what happened!
honest question = extremely sarcastic, unfair, unreasonable, idiotic answer.
if you hate your job so much, leave it!
i ordered the chicken chow mein lunch special recently.
i was actually shocked to find what looked like "chicken soup!"...
patrons be warned!
i don't think they actually have any customer service.
we call them offtrac now.
ontrac was to deliver groceries from two different companies.
over 8 orders ontrac delivered 2 successfully on the day promised.
the rest ranged from 2 to 3 days late.
wouldn't that damage have occurred beforehand and not after the package was already late?
one star is too many for a company with a 25% success rate.
i am only giving one star because i can't give zero stars.
i did not put the iv in my arm!
not worth the money, even with a living social.
food tasted frozen and canned.
better off at olive garden.
in desperate need of a visit from robert irvine and restaurant impossible!
this place is literal bullshit.
i come here at 11 in the morning and ask for a chicken burrito.
first off it doesn't take 30 minutes to cook fucking chicken.
if i could give a zero star review believe me i would.
this restaurant just changed its name to thai thai and raised it prices.
i was a loyal take-out and sit-in customer.
do they think they are on the strip?
the food quality is good, but not at these prices!
i'll be looking for a better priced thai place.
i wish them well!
save your money and go else where!!
poor customer service.
not my thing.
ordered trash can nachos to be safe, but tasted so wrong to me!
pretty sure halloween candy was a major ingredient.
was bummed 'cause i love the dude but it kind of fit him.
loved vibe and location, so will be back to try a burger or something!
the tuna pieces also had a very stinky fish taste.
i had to go to the restroom to spit it out.
horrible and disgusting place.
nothing but a bunch of drunk men swearing and acting like children.
the most disgusting wings i've ever eaten in my life.
oh ya, way over priced!
small portions for high cost.
fatty meat, hard fries, no bread service and expensive.
tired this place for the first time today, and today will be my last.
their food has absolutely no flavor!
they should be embarrassed serving food like this!
save yourself the money and eat somewhere else!!
we ordered the dresses through the website with a rush delivery.
no one ever did.
even after it said that it was ready for pickup.
super unprofessional and rude.
beware if you're getting dresses from here, don't expect great customer service.
i honestly am so disgusted with this place.
the staff is unprofessional.
don't waste any money there.
i used to go here every morning for breakfast but no more.
if you like psychodrama and tension in the morning, this is the place.
the product was pretty useless.
sub par at best.
the customer service was probably the worst i have ever experienced.
45 minute/1 hour hold times, then they transfer you to hold another hour.
then they tell you they cant help you.
gross, gross, gross.
from now on, i will walk the 2 extra blocks to metro.
just called to order a pizza to try something new even after mixed reviews.
had a appointment to get my winter tires changed.
i was near the location and called for directions.
no thanks i will look else where.
we were very loyal customers to this place.
started going many years ago and told people in our neighborhood.
but never ever again.
we always ordered wings, pizza, subs, and canoli's.
pick up and delivery.
no call back or anything when they had my number from the order.
live in the neighborhood and liked this place never ever again.
such a big disappointment.
their service department is a joke.
rude with sub par food = please close soon!
hope the city of phoenix enjoys the $316 they illegally took from me.
worst panera bread ever!!!
coming from a florida resident fresh off the plane and very hungry.
was very excited to see that this location had a drive thru.
can you say refund?
sheeesh get it together
i didn't feel comfortable and i don't trust the guy behind the counter.
go at your own risk
i will say that their drink service is top notch.
i haven't found my glass empty yet.
so that's a plus.
the pics looked good online but the reality was not good at all.
it seemed like it was rushed.
maybe another 3-5 minutes in the oven could have saved it.
bad bad bad bad badi only ate here because it was close by.
the food, bleh.
were all not ripe.
the only thing i remember that was good was the mashed potatoes.
and yay for cotton candy.
i'd have to say our waiter was really attentive and nice though.
they over charged my debit card by $1.75.
watch your statements.
i used to love this place and never checked my receipts.
guess i was to trusting.
you suck culvers!
super slow service.
food came out barely warm and mediocre.
it is vegetarian and vegan friendly but skip it if you have other options.
the food is sooooooo bad.
my boyfriend almost barfed eating the watery crab legs.
please don't waste your money or time.
you will be disappointed.
i recommend going to a nice restaurant for that kind of money.
at least your food will be tasty and fresh!
don't even waste your time with this place !
ordered the chicken parmesan .
literally a pile of frozen chicken with uncooked pasta !
didn't even take a bite threw it straight in the trash!
unfortunately, there is not another place in town to get supplies.
everyone there treats their clients like crap.
they are entitled assholes.
i have never been treated like an equal.
save the trip and your money.
go someplace else.
not taking this airlines again.
this was known days ahead, but notification not provided  until after check in.
it would have been nice to have been advised before then...
as the delay (construction at sf) was/has already been going on.
so in summary..
she said it is cushing's disease.
and the blood test shows no cushing's disease.
the vet bill is $300.
now her tummy is all red and inflamed after the grooming.
there is no reason for my dog to suffer like this.
i will never, never use her again.
overpriced food for small portions.
the good is ok not worth the money.
the ham and cheese is good.
after we left we were hungry that we went to carl's junior.
terrible never again.
this macy's seriously lacks in quality customer service.
they were gossiping, sitting on counters, and texting on their phones.
if only they had such a standard...
be prepared to wait!
2 girls at receptionist desk were just chatting away completely ignoring me.
i just walked out.
my time is important too!
if you are dark complexion i would not recommend this place.
the only good part about this shitty ass chili's was the waitress.
will i ever eat at this chili's again?
no, would i recommend this chili's?
hell to the fucking no.
this is a god awful chili's.
windows dirty, shoulda been my first clue.
also, beef was cold, and returned.
guy asks me if i want something else.
uh, thanks for telling me you dont want my business.
not classy, but neithr is burrito express at hayden.
chuy's is loud, crowded with less than mediocre food.
not a good restaurant for the south park area with its tacky decor.
you can find much better mexican food anywhere in this area.
it's cheap food and i guess that's the draw.
zink the former upscale restaurant at that location allowed dogs on the patio.
this cheap, tacky restaurant doesn't allow dogs.
do not use this company.
the guy arnie is a con artist.
look up his records.
he should be in jail not in business.
horrible customer service.
tried shipping an item for a return and wants to charge for tape.
just two weeks ago went to another ups they did it no problem.
i pay enough for insurance a year.
they are to strict
greeted to a half hour late, cold, disgusting pizza that tasted like rotten vegetables.
i didn't know it was possible to make bad pizza.
i hate little caesar's but they are gourmet pizza compared to this place!
this is simply the worst and most pretentious club ever.
absolutely terrible music, no real dance floor, and very pricey overall.
the dance mist actually smells like sulphur, and is rather disconcerting.
this was a terrible choice for anyone looking for a decent night life venue.
bar none the worst falafel in town.
avoid at all costs.
they overcharge for shipping...
i got charged 25.00 for an item that costs 13.95 at the post office.
bowling with the family.
the people there were completely nuts!!
nobody cared about the bowling alley or anyone else who was there.
the employees did absolutely nothing.
i been to many bowling alleys and understand some people act like this.
this time it was 90% of the people and the lanes were full.
could not concentrate to just have fun and try to get a strike.
wish i could give zero stars!
well that is where the fun begins..
this place is a joke.
maybe stains they left behind.
have you seen this place?
the diner stinks like old grease and dirty dish rag.
it's more of a slimy, seedy underbelly.
i need to go take another shower.
what kind of starbucks only offers one kind of bagel?
girl at counter tells me that, ignores me and waits on the next customer.
this place is by far the worst starbucks i have ever stepped foot in.
i will never return!
staff was incredibly rude.
listen, the gelato is amazing, but the customer service is terrible.
the guy helping us hates his job and stated it freely.
it's a shame because this place has so much potential.
remember you have to hire for character, you can teach skills.
in this case you can't teach personality.
review coming from a black man.
as a result, my package has been delayed for one day thus far.
i called last min.
i made the situation very uncomfortable.
i don't think that i would call or purchase from them again.
why the he'll even go there if you can't sit in an open seat.
drinks are mediocre and service is horrible i hope this place gets shut down.
also ordered a sandwhich the meat was rainbow colored which is usually bacteria.
don't go here it sucks !
make that minus one star.
even worse than the food is the lame manager.
hopefully this will be called to their attention,sooner rather than later.
lady that owns this place is rude as well.
waited over an hour and a half with 4 people in front of me.
receptionist was nice but that's all.
no urgency with my 103 degree fever and chills.
very disappointed in the "new" concept.
no buffet, but pre-cooked food, think school cafeteria.
all the downside of a buffet, with none of the upside.
none of the good fried stuff.
no cucumbers or vegetables or chutneys.
the serving was mostly sauce and over cooked.
styrofoam plates and cups.
we would go a few times a year to this place before the change.
will not be back.
still tipped 20% because that is me.
but really bad service.
who puts a clean spoon directly on a table?!
very sub par food.
grits dry, breakfast potatoes just frozen out of a bag.
very disappointed especially since we are huge fans of sister concept josh and nosh.
save time and go there.
packhouse should pack it up.
a public park in excruciatingly correct urbana, il.
it charges a fee, for "safety." silly, off-putting.
don't go !!
terrible service and cutting skills!
i told the lady one side of my hair was longer then the other.
she's says honey everyone has that problem?!?
they make you wait while they take their time.
don't even greet or say thanks after i gave them a tip.
i would never go back.
omg, i thought harrah southern california had a bad buffet, this place was nasty.
never again all 4 of us agreed
the servers and bartenders are wasted.
will never go back again.
thanks but no thanks.
you are giving all of us a bad name.
love panda, but they are never prepared.
they don't have enough chow mein or other entrees ready.
then you have a 5-10 min wait.
it's 12noon, they should have tons of extras ready.
cheap and no quality service at all.
it's a rip off.
cheap prices are not worth your hassle.
this stuff is terrible.
i tried their blueberry and strawberry yogurt parfait and the blueberries had gone bad.
the pizza sauce is straight up flavorless crushed tomatoes without any seasoning?
after sitting and waiting for 20 minutes we ended up leaving the restaurant.
too bad because the restaurant has a really nice  ambiance and food looked good.
i booked an appointment with jessica after seeing all the positive reviews.
what a mistake!
she proceeded to cut of maybe a year's worth of hair off.
i think she was having fun at my expense.
never again, boulevard salon.
i don't even know what mystery meat was in my chicken club sub.
poor communication and  unprofessional.
i hired the company to manage my property.
for 2 weeks, people  came and saw the house and left comments.
conrad klein never once called me with feedback.
received one email out of 7 feedback on there portal.
they definitely don't care once they have you onboard.
they don't even deserve one star.
i do not understand how they're still in business.
this is the third time i've dealt with them through my insurance company.
they finally show up and the driver is rude!!
second time i waited three hours and they did not show up at all.
the company location has literally been 11-15 minutes from me each time.
large selection, small quality.
go to the wynn if you want food cooked by chefs.
if you want food cooked by cooks, go to the bellagio.
average quality for way too much money.
unproffesional and in terrible taste.
the only plus was the real maple syrup with the breakfast buffet.
bottom line, they are nowhere near worth the money.
this store needs an attitude adjustment.
i proceeded to ask about pricing.
i will now shop amazon and costco they care about their customers.
if something is wrong they can't do enough to make it right.
hi all - let me preface this with i'm a pretty reasonable customer.
i'm okay with waiting, but this was ridiculous.
worst service that you'll get your life.
i will never ever return back here again.
plus soda machines were out and still got charged for my disgusting drink!!!
if you love burgers, hit up  fat burger 3 miles down the road.
not good...terrible food, and even worse service..
felt ignored the whole time after telling server about the papaya salad...
pretty bold to tip yourself after a dining experience like that!
not the healthiest option.
just like some other customers, i was "reminded" to tip them...
for what i do not know.
the greeter people are rude and see no value of customer retention.
the tables were only less than 1/3 full at 6 pm.
l found most of the food to be warm and no flavor.
good and bad i guess.
fried chicken was cooked just right (crispy) with a no flavor.
brussel sprouts had no bacon as advertised.
also no bacon bits for the salad.
i liked the decor, the soup was good, the food was below average.
but the owner was a creep.
he made us feel uncomfortable and i couldn't wait to leave.
i will never eat there again.
walked into jason's with my kids and shocked at filthy dining area.
i think u get the point.
horrible horrible communication.
first i heard of it so i was alil irritated.
i like to support local biz, but this guy didn't have a clue.
returned home and purchased an instrument from amazon.
terrible customer service!
we close on our home and can not have personal property left on site.
customer service just laughed and said the day has been terrible- sorry!
so far your service has been anything but great.
i would not recommend this company or service that they provide.
horrible customer service.
this place used to be great, but all the good employees are gone.
staff is lazy.
they use scoopers now and they barely fill them when makingthe sandwiches.
i advise you to do the same.
don't come to this place without reading the reviews!
i have never been such a restaurant with this bad service!
how come they are still open after so many 1 star reviews?
currently have been waiting 30 minutes for two shakes.
we've asked twice where they are.
will never be back, this is insane!
then they finally gave them to us completely melted.
then they remade them...incorrectly.
we were offered nothing for our time, barely an apology.
total time was 50 mins for 2 shakes.
less than welcoming hostess.
inattentive wait staff.
we waited 5 minutes for someone to acknowledge us at the door.
we waited 15 minutes for our waitress to stop by the table.
we walked out after over 30 minutes of just sitting and twiddling our thumbs.
i will never go back.
thing are still awful.
road bike shoes that retail list for $128.95.
this is probably the worst rental car establishment on the planet.
we ordered a salad that says it has watermelon in it.
once i looked closer at the description it said watermelon radish.
not what i wanted at all.
i won't come back.
so, if you want rude people feeding you expired food, this is your spot.
budget rent a car location was horrible.
scheduled a cut with rod because of his good reviews on yelp.
my hair looked horrible and resembled an 80s mullet.
so much for growing it out..
i decided to write a personal check in the amount of $59.53.
mind you i had enough money in my account to cover that amount.
to my surprise i got declined.
the cashier asked her supervisor who was nearby.
i was totally shocked what his answer was to me.
he said i got declined because i don't shop at best buy often enough.
do you think i plan to go back to this store?
i made a reservation on carrentals.com, $160 for 3 days for a standard car.
the  guy talks me into an upgrade for a "great price".
it's ok until he tried to get me to sign the $489 agreement.
he tries to tell me that is arizona's high tax rate on rental cars.
claimed my daughter had cavities upon a 2nd review proved she did not.
we will never go back there again.
if i could give this place zero stars, i would.
if you want to close at 9:15 then change your hours.
p.s. turn off your open sign as well.
horrible horrible service.
then i looked up the ingredients, it said 50g of sugar.
2 fraps for 15$, threw them right in the trash.
starbucks should be embarrassed
we had lunch for the first time at sky asian bistro.
beware of the all you can eat menu.
i can understand about not wasting food but a bun
i immediately had to call my bank and cancel my card.
just a heads up for customers going there.
really poor quality.
the food was some sort of weird ersatz mexican.
it was poorly prepared and poorly served.
the decor is colorful dreary.
not conducive to even having an appetite.
the service was sullen.
even though it is not expensive, it is not worth the little you pay!
avoid at all costs.
it might work better in a less demanding area?
even the buttery goodness of their crust wasn't worth the wait.
do not go here!!!
horrible customer service!!
racist employees and managers!!
the bills of my peers.
i would not recommend this company.
sorry but i'm about done with goodwills in the greater charlotte area.
that definitely applied to this location.
this is rediculous place.
the price of the food is like a tourist price.
their waffle is $5.75 thats only a simple waffle.
if you go to denny's you can have a complete breakfast  for that price.
this is a no no no place to go.
i will not recommend this place to anybody.
this place had the worst food i've had on my entire vacation.
it's basically an applebee's for 3 times the price.
service was crap, its loud, and the water has soap in it.
i feel very terrible that someone yelled at me on the phone.
customer service is below 0.
the driver was very nice and professional his name is oliver.
mcnulty's, as of september 2008, is under new management.
no more table service, limited (crappy) menu, price hike on beer...
what's worse, this used t o be my favorite little neighborhood pub.
what a shame.
food has taken a large step back.
buns are horrible.
bun fell apart before i took my first bite.
i gave one start bc our waitress was atleast very good.
this location constantly gets my order incorrect.
what i got was a side cup of ice.
and a half filled cup of coffee.
i didnt pay for half a cup of coffee.
wouldn't recommend this location
they forgot the dressing to my chicken cesar salad.
the manager was totally rude and told me "it wasnt her problem.
the pizza was disgusting.
i will never order from here again.
no matter how many massages you leave, no matter what option you chose......
they just don't give a xxxxgood luck to you.
four things constituted this poor review of living spaces.
went to the store and it was not the correct color.
(website explained fabric as "dark grey" store display was a variegated taupe.
i purchased a grande flat white, and it was half way full.
i meant really?
i paid five dollars for a half cup of grande size.
fucking savages switched the song while some people were singing.
not even like they had a song on queue...
just let these poor folk sing into the silence..
the food here is really good.
it there is just zero sense of urgency.
literally every time i'm here i'm always waiting on the staff.
what you'd think is a nail salon is really a butcher shop.
myself, girlfriend and mother all went for pedis and they also got manicures.
myself not included in the manicure session because my fingernails are amazing as is.
i am very sad to report that our service was poor for sunday brunch.
the restaurant was fairly empty, so crowds were not the issue that affected service.
12/28/13.....love popeyes, but will never go back to this one.
this is one of the filthiest popeyes i have ever seen.
the tables, pop dispensing area, and the floor was filthy.
it made for a very uncomfrotable dining experience.
such mismanaged place .
got take out tonight.
wow this place is the worst chinese food i have ever had!
also asked for extra spicy orange chicken which was very runny and all breading.
i don't recommend this place to anyone.
ordered delivery told 40 min (ok) arrived in 20 min ???
i know this is a gimmick by companies to thwart the negative reviews.
i was so furious i almost left right then without eating my food.
i will eat there again but this young lady is awful!!!!!
this club was not like the other two that we visited while in vegas.
this was the last stop on our club party bus crawl.
the music sucked, the crowd was dead.
overall, awful, terrible, no good time was had by anyone in my party.
i will not come back.
never ever will my family and eat here again!
just walked out after waiting for over a  hour for my food.
horrible customer service and such a disappointment.
we ate here late last night because of the poor food at another restaurant.
we decided to try a chain to make sure we would get food food.
well we were disappointed again.
the scrambled eggs were sweet and the turkey sausage was salty.
not very good at all.
i won't even endeavor to describe what i think was supposed to be coleslaw.
the restaurant itself was filthy to boot!
you could not pay me to eat there again.
the upshot to this review was that the wait staff were terrific.
this place is a joke!
go over west of it, on the north side to soupersalad.
people walking out by the groves!
if this was $35 a night..kool..
but at $60??!!
insane this is one of the worst motels.
yelp doesn't allow zero stars.
i don't know why
was turned away because supposedly the cook has left already.
we love bld for the people that build the business
these people could learn a little about customer service.
this lady was so rude.
this was disappointing!
great atmosphere, nice people, poor service, cold food.
very very disappointed.
waitress took a long time to seat us.
we decided to leave.
i order pad see ew .
there's not much noodle , you can barely see.
i didn't expect a carrot in pad see ew!
you don't carrots in pad see ew, lol.
i'm just disappointed because here's little noodle :( .
it's too pricey for what i order .
came here a while ago but to get my nails done for prom.
i said okay cool i'll be back at 6.
by that time it's 7:30 and she doesn't even start my nails until 8.
i asked for a simple matte black, coffin nails with silver nail polish.
then she charged me $60 for them when she originally said $35.
i'll never come here again.
i ordered delivery and waited over an hour and a half for my food...
called them twice...
never got it.
maybe better to not go for the delivery option.
came on an "event night" so the menu was limited...very limited.
food was decent and the server was very sweet.
terrible customer service and unprofessional business practices.
i will never return.
needless to say i went somewhere else.
i addressed it with the manager and this video was taken after that.
clearly my concerns were not hers.
his name was jake.
worst experience ever.
charged my 1300 dollars for 5 day rental.
i disputed charge and have never been contacted by the company.
avoid at all cost.
extremely poor service.
no apology just seemed very confused.
first of all, the line arrangement may seem professional but it's not.
why complicate things?
just have 1 person check out orders instead of 1 person per certain meats?
secondly, customer service is inefficient and unprofessional.
lost appetite and won't come back.
you get better service for street tacos instead.
they will rob you blind.
don't move here.
didn't care just kinda blew everyone off,food got cold real fast .
great local bar with excellent drinks and food .
their sunday 2 for 1 steak special is awesome .
absolutely unacceptable and will not go back there again .
they arbitrarily took it in their own hands to jeopardize my son health .
the gm expressed his concern and the waitress comped the other meals .
nice gesture but cannot take a chance on them again .
it's a shame as we have been going there since the grand opening .
i hesitate to write negative reviews unless i feel i need to warn people.
i came here for a haircut on two separate occasions.
the first time, my neck was cut with a straight razor.
everyone makes mistakes.
i gave the place another shot, albeit with a different barber.
i will not be returning.
but the employees ruin everything.
then maybe customers will get the correct order and some freakin' respect!
if i didn't work near this dunkin' i wouldn't never come here again.
if there was a way to give zero stars, i would.
went to bowl a 500 club tournament there.
i was done.
worst tournament i have ever bowled in.
will never bowl there again.
prism tv and centurylink are absolutely the worst.
technical support is a joke.
they will quote you anything and totally lie about how much it costs.
if i could give 0 stars, i would.
will not be returning.
this office is not honest.
i went there for a routine eye check up.
i showed my id and insurance card.
just told me after the service is done.
i could have gone somewhere where i'm covered.
they just wanted my money.
it doesn't matter if i signed a financial responsibility.
worse pharmacy in belmont.
customer service = nonexistent.
i highly recommend the walgreens right across the street.
if i could give it a zero i would!!!
my mom would renew her policy & extra charges would be added.
i wish i could give a zero!!!
worst customer service ever.
i got the car plus $10 per day for collision insurance.
needless to say i went somewhere else!!
bad place, awful experience and they are very rude!
i wish expedia would drop this company off their website.
always out of certain donuts after 1 pm.
we were the only customers.
bought a box of assorted and they were oily.
you could taste the same oil in all the donuts.
still like dunkin better.
the customer service is terrible which makes a huge difference.
indeed you will wait a very long time to speak to a representative.
it would have taken him/her a minute.
but obviously this was too much trouble.
driver probably was just too tired and decided to call it a day.
if not, there will be hell to pay.
way to make amazon look bad ontrac.
they only have pink and white powder, no colors.
don't ask for an ombr...
didn't even let them finish, they did 3 nails and i walked out.
worst service ever!
we waited forever to get somebody to take orders from us.
and that's right after we told them that we are ready to order!
wrong drinks served as well.
the waitress is just not in the mood of working!
this was "the" worst breakfast we have ever had.
the breakfast special was terrible.
pancakes and hash browns were like the frozen stuff out of a box.
please avoid at all cost!!!
if i could it would be zero stars.
this is plain crazy.
the pharmacist is trying very hard to help the customers.
the customer service of the front staff is horrible.
phone lines are busy, no one is answering and prescriptions aren't being filled.
sorry but find another pharmacy.
if you don't care, i don't want you working on my home.
this dentist is a crook!
glad to see his office has closed!
i had only had one my entire life!
i moved out of gilbert and just went to a new dentist.
crazy enough he didn't find a single cavity!!!
i will never again go to a dentist that doesn't do the sane thing!
worst cheesecake every been to, food is gross, service is poor.
horrible chef horrible uncooked food
almost four years ago, i went to purchase a car for the first time.
someone needs to step up and take responsibility for this unsafe vehicle.
came here for thanksgiving dinner with my family.
my dad who lives in vegas made the reservations.
this place is great...if you are looking for food poisoning!
my older son and i were the only one's that didn't get sick.
that was because my son ordered the chicken and i had crab legs.
thanks bob for ruining our vacation!
i  would not recommend this place at all.
the comments from the management is interesting.
i just got a regular manicure.
not sure what sns or whatever it is the manager is saying.
we will never set foot in this place again!
charging seniors $4 for parking?
why gouge and double dip against seniors on pension?
dr.armagon is two faced and an insensitive person.
the manager alice needs an attitude adjustment.
we despise your success to the dismay of seniors hoping for compassion and care.
avoid at all costs.
was seated and waited 20 minutes, no one ever came and acknowledged us.
decent food, great location and absolutely horrible service.
we went two different times.
same poor service.
we will not return.
plenty of other places to visit.
waited over an hour for some cold, soggy eggs benedict with bland potatoes.
i'm normally pleased with the service at topgolf but today was horrible.
still paid full price for everything.
this week i had a totally different experience.
mr. rooter diagnosed the plumbing problem and gave me a repair estimate of $720.
they wouldn't document the estimate when i refused to approve the job.
i called another plumber.
the repair was the replacement of a two foot hose and cost me $168.
this company does not deliver on what it says.
stay away from them.
but im telling u by first hand dont ever go here ...
cause all your gonna is your money taken from you ...
pizza was big, but for from great.
not even close.
even though their commercials say call and order.
the food here is not good, and the service wasn't very good either.
sorry pepe's tacos, i will not be eating here again.
i walked in to try to give this place another try.
right away i was driven off by a horrible smell...
our server refused to accept my minnesota driver's license.
my experience at kelly's was quite upsetting.
avoid if you have an out-of-state or international id--they only trust pennsylvania driver's licenses!
i've never received such bad service from anyone like i experienced from this store.
i went in and order two smoothies plus a soda, and wraps..
making faces and giving attitude.
i got a refund and left the store.
i will not be returning to this store again.
called to ask about a price on a bike.
they told me the msrp which i already knew.
so i asked for the total price after taxes and fees.
he said he would need to calculate it and call me later.
i said i didn't mind being on hold while he calculated.
waited over 15 minutes on the line before i decided to hang  up.
definitely not a good look for them.
will not rent from avis again
we waited 1 hour to receive our entree that was wrong.
it's a total waste of time.
nice people horrible food!
just go for drinks!
i will never go back!
first and last time in this establishment!
very unprofessional, should be listed as rent a wreck!
couldn't safely see at night, returned car second day.
they cleaned it with gasoline inside - couldn't get in vehicle because of odor.
just so bad.
stay away - run!
apparently someone loaded my car in the wash machine and "was not paying attention".
i did not even get an apology.
all o got was a free spray wax by evan.
i posted pictures to see results
wish i could give them 1/2 star.
rudest sales people i have ever met!!
it bothers me that i even have to give it one star.
i don't know what happened over the last year.
food lacks taste, flavor or consistency.
almost like refrozen dehydrated pop in the fryer cheap ingredients.
more so now i think they just don't care.
we all got sick with diarrhea and vomiting.
came here during macaron day where they advertised a free macaron.
the macarons itself were pretty standard, not bad but not amazing.
gggrrrrr wal mart!
can i get away with never ever visiting another walmart in my life please?
gggrrrrr - that's it!
their food taste horrible and the smallest portions ever.
waste of money and waste of time.
think twice before storing an rv here.
ours was broken into and vandalized along with several other trailers.
they told us to file a police report.
i definitely relate to jessica's experience.
owner is deceitful & unreliable.
she may have forgotten the fiasco but i certainly have not.
most stressful shopping experience of my life.
this restaurant is filthy.
restrooms are dirty.
floors are filthy.
wait staff is not attentive.
sent glass back with floaty things in it.
food lost its appeal.
steak nachos - steak was tough.
i did'nt care for them because of that.
gave the meat to my dogs.
they enjoyed it!
the venetian is already beginning to show its age.
the staff is snooty and often makes promises they can't deliver on.
be prepared to wait at least 30 minutes for anything.
the food in the casino area is overpriced and greasy.
but the treatment of buying anything behind the gun counter is terrible!
i won't return to buy anything from there!
i will never go again!
totally avoid this place.
the food at flavor lacked flavor completely.
it must take some effort to make simple dishes taste so bad!
been there twice and won't be back unless its just for drinks.
the food is greasy and of poor quality.
meals arrive cold....servers are super busy and harried.
much better places in the neighbourhood.
yup, there's no other way to say it.
waiter: "the special today is a bison steak".
me: "rare please." the bill "$68+ tax".
(ended up being more expensive than anything else on the menu!).
lost a customer for life.
no offense, worst hair cut of my life.
my barber was the japanese guy.
just cut my hair and doesn't know how to fade.
made circles and patches where the fading should be.
nice guy but bad haircut.
ordered eggs benedict.
sauce had no kick to it.
it was mainly buttery/cheesy taste.
don't waste your time.
workers stole stuff out of house (food/drinks).
however, they did replace the food and drink they stole.
they broke numerous items as well.
lack of follow up has been an issue.
when they specifically said they would but nothing!!!
on 4/10/17 i went in after two years of membership to cancel my membership.
tell me how this is convenient for the customer.
are you serious.
all i can say is you're welcome i kept the lights on for you.
one star is generous.
never fly this airline.
you're not saving any money and the service is terrible.
see you in court.
my wife went here to get an outfit for my sister's henna night.
i am convinced her instagram posts about her clients are entirely about her friends.
i also recommend reading the 'not suggested' reviews below for more insight.
she could've make it as manual transaction until their system is back to normal.
i used to work at retail store and that's what they're supposed to do.
all i need is a light bulb for my headlight.
so, bad customer service, didn't even try to help.
looks like the new management let go the old staff.
quality is not as good, staff a little rude.
i am going to miss this place!
orange chicken type dishes should not ever be made into quesadillas.
i would like to give them a 5 for the food.
it is great!
but lately they have been forgetting orders.
today i ordered chicken souvlaki dinner with a large lentil soup.
are you kidding me?
i drove all the way back to get the food i paid for!
joe if you're reading this you need new staff that are competent and empathetic!!!!
i tried this place out b/c it's close to my house.
the massage was alright, not enough pressure for my liking but not terrible.
the reason for one star?
mind you, these weren't tips based on percentages, just flat rates for all services.
$7 was nearly 20%.
i was horrified that she would even ask such a thing.
i stated $7 was enough and left and i will never return!
oh my god!
don't even bother...the worst food ever.
nothing thai tasting, the noodles are just soy sauce and some vegetable.
the spicy chicken, meh!
the spring roll is a joke.
waste of money.
try to avoid this place like the plague!
the big issue is understaffing and poor customer service.
the management is apparently too greedy to hire adequate staff to answer the phone.
there is often a long line, both in the store and at the drive-thru.
will not be going back.
a terrible lunch that ended in physical pain.
second time around they didnt have much more cheese than before.
wings did not taste very good.
i only ate half.
i will not be returning.
if you want to feel unwelcomed this is the place to go.
will not ever be back.
great location, and absolutely lovely area.
a new company took over and things went down hill from there.
maintenance never really fixes anything they just do ghetto patch work.
rent is reasonable but you get what you pay for.
there's an older lady that works in the office that was very rude.
this restaurant was better then than it is now!
that's most definitely a different story now!
i am giving one star because i have to, otherwise they'd get zero.
they take advantage of people and are practically stealing.
i asked my gal to get us a table as i used the restroom.
15 minutes to get seated when the dinning room looked mostly vacant.
note to management...
if half your restaurant is empty try filling the seats.
i expect more from sprouts
very disappointed in the dentist and staff at affordable dentures.
i had my mother go there because of the high ratings in yelp.
my mother explained she couldn't t eat with bottom dentures.
they sent her home with no teeth.
elderly people need extra patience.
very very unhappy with this company.
do not call these people.
they are a rip off.
they take a shop vac and blow dust everywhere and charge 200 bucks!
warning stay away!!!!
stale chips and $7 burrito???!!
no thank you.
i'd rather have food from the roach coach
crab legs are always cold and stale.what's the deal?
lobster isn't good.longhorn and outback have better lobster than them...
similar to reviewer above.
too much socializing, singing loudly in store.
damaged my present phone while transferring phones.
denies it, but it worked before they touched it.
management is awful!
most of the staff are just rude kids.
i would not recommend this location at all.
worst place to use ever.
they never told us we couldn't use a debit card.
and couldn't use more than 400 miles on the car.
ridiculous experience never use them.
only put a star because negative stars isn't a thing on here.
do not let her wax you.
so now you have committed fraud.
beware the surprise, deceptive, nowhere listed on the menu "rocks service" charge.
disappointed in this place.
the food was pretty good, but the waiter (o****) forgot the appetizer and waters.
the rest of the tables looked like they were having a great time though.
over priced for organic.
this guy gave me a rate of 223 per hour and 8 hour min.
i understand it's a sunday and i'm cool with the double time.
this guy is not about customer service.
don't ever use this company.
i don't think he done his research on the market.
just out to rip people off.
don't ever use.
i won't be coming back here.
i was excited that this opened near my work, only to be greatly disappointed.
i have given this location 3 chances.
first time i sat in drive thru , and sat, and sat.
this place is ridiculous.
they had an hour before closing.
he wasn't very friendly either.
fyi, we left.
never will come here again.
please manager, teach your servers etiquette.
updated version from my prior review.
the staff were very pleasant at this location.
the work was not good unfortunately the gel mani lasted one day only.
by day three i had not one nail intact.
my cuticles were trimmed so closer that it was just painful for a week.
i walked up to the counter and both attendants are on the phone.
just stand there waiting feeling "who is the customer here?".
then i say who is the customer and she starts arguing with me.
then she said she would call security on me !
neither i nor anyone needs this from a restaurant !
i just walked away.
i ordered shrimp with lobster sauce and crab rangoons.
nothing about this place felt or tasted remotely authentic.
the quality, variety, and service trump this place hands down.
if i could give these guys a -10 i totally would.
horrible service, horrible experience.
after 9pm they do not allow men to wear flip flops.
don't go here.
while the work looks good, the service was horrible.
we came here to try their brisket...it was awful.
no smokey flavor, no crust, bland and tasteless really.
if it weren't for their sauces we wouldn't have been able to finish.
fries were good.
check them out!
my beer was flat.
and on top of that the service was lackluster.
really bad experience.
don't go here, move on to the next place.
i could have made better at home.
2 whole shrimp!
over cooked at that.
the chicken was dry and there was no sauce or heat to speak of.
obviously, this was the last time we'll be going here.
there's so much better thai in the city, don't waste your time going here.
my husband and i had dinner there last night.
he ordered chicken nachos and i ordered salmon.
it took almost an hour to get our food.
last time i checked, it didn't take that long for nachos and salmon.
more than half way through our wait, they brought us chips and salsa.
this was some piss poor customer service.
it was our first and last time.
we'll stick to cactus moon.
don't even bother.
idk how this place gets 4 stars but i was very disappointed.
the people behind the counter were rude.
there was a very limited selection, and i was honestly concerned about food poisoning.
it was just tired old, blah food.
and the bathroom was disgusting.
go to caesars palace buffett instead!!!
great if you like waiting for 35 minutes, after calling half hour ago.
annoying as hell.
i wish i had taken a picture.
it was really quite crap.
the server, though, was very nice.
bad place to going dr goodman is not a good obgyn!!
who i had already locked up per his request!
it was a complete and total waste of my time.
which the idiot didn't even know till i told him!
if i had said boxer would you have left my house?!
the food was very heavy.
we felt like we just gained 20pounds.
we r full in a bad way.
the food looked appetizing.
menu looked appealing but food did not taste good.
smoky, smoky, smoky!!!!
they were not enclosed or sectioned off in their own room.
beers were $6 and hey had plenty of staff running around.
if you enjoy gambling and an enjoyable atmosphere hen this is not your place.
i love smoke's poutine but do not visit this location!
the help is more interested in looking at their phones.
waited for 5 minutes for help.
ran right back to behind the counter.
to the manager- train your people!
worst customer service!!
total scam company from top to bottom.
they will lure you in with promotions and discounts and then not honor them.
do not trust them, better yet, do not do business with them.
zero stars--probably the worst company all around that i have ever dealt with.
hopefully a decent company will run them out of business soon!
i can't even....
david is the worst captain we have ever had.........
hate this because i used to love this place......
they don't care because they have already got there money.
bad service at this taco bell
they trap you in a year long contract and won't let you cancel.
not worth the money.
too bad you don't want my business........
came here today 9/1 to pick up some donuts and they were completely rude.
didn't even get a hello entering and was basically ignored.
the blond kid behind the register had no clue on how to use it.
talk about complete bullshit.
don't go there.
nothing fancy, just a basic furnished 2 br/2ba place away from the strip.
several staff members, including lou, were knowledgeable and courteous.
she didn't respond to emails in a timely fashion and never returned calls.
had the worst experience with safeway this week.
it's now 3:30 and i've heard nothing from anyone.
finally got a table then waited another 20 minutes before we could get water.
then another 10 before anyone took our order.
not sure about the food yet because we may never get it.
day shift guy keep it up your good.
food was not authentic tasting.
the yams tasted canned.
the cook was sweating and the food was cold.
perhaps just a bad day.
never going back there
silka was really rude and ruined the experience.
food was great but horrible customer service.
she didn't seem to know were things where and she borrowed other people's supplies.
which by law they are supposed to all have there license on display.
has the tranquility of a doctors office, my facial experience wasn't good at all...
and third i didn't see his license on the wall?
i don't recommend it at all.
we love cpk and frequent the desert ridge location in north phoenix.
i'm sticking with desert ridge from now on..
why did i waste my time here?
i did think the hamburger was good.
the shake tasted good.
but the service and lack of organization was bad.
they dont do takeout orders!
which is detrimental to  late shift workers on the vegas strip.
poor service to refuse.
i'm just in the paris garage...
i'll find something else!
i think they just put coffee in a cup.
will never go back to that place again.
may just go to the golden arches (yuck) for an espresso.
can't be any worse.
and you too can have all this for an 18% gratuity that is mandatory.
we have made it a tradition to go here for birthday dinners.
i doubt we'll be going back.
this place has the worst employees ever!!
no one wants to work and they are all very rude!!
i am done giving them my business!!
i love earls but the service at the ceasars location is the worst.
after waiting for 15 min.
obviously some else had picked up our order because we still had our beeper.
i would never go back or tell anyone to rush there.
all three of us had a stomach upset and stomach pain.
i couldn't go to work for 2 days straight.
and i still have the stomach upset and diarrhea.
bad food don't eat from there.
i was extremely disappointed.
multi tasking is not this staffs strong point.
carl's jr. across the street perhaps.
online the price was advertised as lower than what the in store price was.
they refused to honour the advertised price.
"deep dish" is just double crust.
this place is horrible.
they always get your your order wrong.
they have a "don't care" attitude.
this place should be shut down.
where is the health department???
they give you coffee lids that are dirty and filled with bacteria.
fyi-do not use their bathroom.
had to walk out due to them disrespectfully talking with me and my bf.
the service was slow.
i ordered two tacos and found a hair on one of them.
i will not return to this establishment.
first time i took our dog she came home sick.
took her back a few times after that she did well.
i paid for lessons.
that was a waste of money.
do not recommend will never go back.
but dr. kuty seemed to be concerned with your treatment plan.
and not their kids
christmas buffet very bad!!!
charging 20$ for fast pass!
taking advantage of the christmas season!
don't go here!
decent but wouldn't be in business in the midwest.
i guess az really has no competition in the bbq space.
the sides are ridiculously horrible.
just amazed at all the hype.
i was quoted almost triple $378.53 for 2000 cards at 14pt.
showed up for a massage that i booked.
i have filled out numerous pregnancy waivers and received massages.
today they refused to see me because they have no prenatal certified therapists..
come to find out my last therapist wasn't even prenatal certified.
extremely disappointed in this location.
subway at the airport, awes.....
whoa, $10.99 for my favorite turkey footlong?
i don't think so.
i'll pass thanks.
so i stopped by for a slice.
i choose an all dressed pizza.
i freak out.
i kindly walk away disgusted and in disbelief.
i will never, ever eat there again.
save yourself the trauma and go somewhere else for you slice of pizza.
unfortunately we forgot about that and chose it anyway.
very poor food with amateur level service.
they can not survive for long this way.
this is the first and only time i will shop on-line with nordstrom.
my dog was in great need of a nice grooming, and a nail trimming.
however, to much of my surprise, my experience was horrible!
my dog didn't even look like she had been cleaned!!
10/10 would not recommend and will never go back again.
we went in there looking for a car for our son!
to say the least keffer stinks!!!
i attempted to make an appointment online.
it stated someone would call me to confirm my appointment.
guess i'll take my money elsewhere.
the restaurant was nice over all..
you can smell in the scent from the different stores around.
definitely do not recommend this place.
save your money and stay somewhere else.
robin hood mentality and bait and switch.
dismal and dirty office, horrible customer service and antiquated equipment.
was charged 4 times the amount quoted on phone.
trying to speak to a supervisor has not been successful.
avoid these scam artists at all costs.
***update***another long wait at this horrible place.
this place does not know the meaning of customer service**workers obviously hate their jobs.
went in for an oil change and to get a headlight bulb changed out.
was quoted $1200 because apparently so many other things were wrong with the car.
we took it elsewhere and got everything we required done for $34
i was bothered by it the entire time.
and he should.
hopefully the owner reads this and takes note.
i usually dont bad mouth a restaurant, but this place i have to!
the food was awfull, and not to mention the service sucked!
their sushi tasted like paper and cardboard, not fish.
a total rip off!!!
were looking for chainsaw chain.
could not found any for regular canadian tire yardworks product!!!
half chains missing, not even at the back of the store in warehouse!
do not recommend , if you look for something specific go other store.
they may not have it in stock what you looking for.
not busy and service is super slow!
the employees need to be trained all over again it seems.
which isn't what i wanted.
and she basically said sorry shrugged and didn't offer to fix the mistake.
won't be going back to this location.
robin hood mentality and bait and switch.
dismal and dirty office, horrible customer service and antiquated equipment.
was charged 4 times the amount quoted on phone.
trying to speak to a supervisor has not been successful.
avoid these scam artists at all costs.
dirty rooms and no coffee pot.
no cable or direct tv.
bad area with shady people.
don't go here!
if i could give zero stars i would.
every time i walk in the store they try to increase my monthly bill.
check your paperwork carefully because promises are worthless to these people.
if you need real help, find a youtube video or change service providers.
bring a book.
i got the jerk chicken wrap as i read somewhere it was good.
i have never had a more tasteless sandwich in my life.
i also got carrot juice which tasted really odd......
kinda like the real thing but not really.
i tasted a hint of potato and pumpkin, and perhaps sugar....?
needless to say, i will not be going there anymore.
ordered the chicken pesto pizza, which was solidly in the "atrocious" category.
largely bland, astonishingly greasy, and left me feeling both unfulfilled and mildly ill.
***watch out***my fiance and i recently adopted a 2 month old lab/mix puppy.
3 days after having her we found more ticks...
one being less than an inch away from her surgical area.
i find it disgusting how this facility keeps their pets.
we took her to our vet and she now has kennel cough.
worst restaurant experience i've ever had.
horrible service, the entire staff was rude, inattentive every single order was wrong.
all the checks were wrong.
the guacamole took 20 minutes.
we weren't even greeted for 15 minutes.
the manager ended up taking over and still was getting everything wrong!!!!!
and they weren't even busy.
if you want an enjoyable restaurant experience, do not come here.
very rude, and takes a very long time do anything, very poor service.
stick to your posted hours you twats.
been here several times looking for a neighborhood bar.
this is not it.
very cliqueish gamers who are not very welcoming.
kinda like high school except with 60 year olds.
the food makes me sick and uncomfortable after i return the room.
i thought some of the food is not clean.
the tuna i think was off, not impressed with this place.
the sushi rice, was just sticky rice without any seasoning.
the poke itself wasn't anything special.
with raw fish it has to be as fresh as possible.
also the person taking cash wasn't the friendliest.
i'm wishing there were less stars because one star is too many!
um..not so much..its bad when you ask an employee for assistance...
but no can do...
employee bradley attempted to assist me..
his response to my question regarding isle location.
just a moment i don't know, i need to get my cheat sheet..
ok. so he advised me what isle.
well...it must have been a very old cheat sheet.
because he told me the wrong isle....
very disappointed with the service.
my first time at that location...nope....
i used to die to come to this buffet.
the food was amazing: great selection, hot and fresh and just plain delicious.
i'm not sure what happened....
the food now is awful!
i will not be back to this buffet that was once my must have.
unfortunately, over the last year the service has declined significantly.
we have had 4 very bad experiences in the last year at various locations.
today's experience was negative from start to finish.
bad, disorganized, slow, and inconsistent service ruined our celebratory graduation dinner.
ordered a burger cooked medium well.
burger came medium if it was cooked that much.
made server aware of it but said we didn't want another one.
burger had no taste.
manager came over to see if there was anything he could do for us.
explained what we told waiter and showed him picture of undercooked burger.
didn't comp anything off of bill.
not going there again.
i fucking think not.
and you,  reader, should go elsewhere too.
my wife and i met up with friends at harumi sushi.
we were excited considering the high reviews.
the waitress who picked up the order denied ever having taken it.
i wouldn't recommend stoping here.
there are likely better sushi establishments in the area with far better customer service.
manager refused to return item that my wife and i bought.
i was informed that they are now discontinued and unabled to be resold.
how are the customer to know if an item is being discontinued.
the official pizza of the diamondbacks is papa johns pizza.
good old papa johns.
skip breakfast lunch and dinner and just order a papa johns pizza right now.
land lord called rainforest out because of a smell coming from my pipes.
ricky showed up and went to the bathroom and walked back out.
siad i smell something.
asked me how long i lived here.
then said he has to call his mgr.
first we ordered calamari, i definitely had better ones.
then some dim sum, i didn't like them.
that was for sure my first and last visit there
everything was really really salty!!
this place is nasty.
their pizza is shit.
it sits out all day and is very dry.
i bet some of those pizzas are a few days old.
nothing there is fresh.
i will never be back.
i rather go to nypd pizza.
hell even dominos and pizza hut has better pizzas than this shit hole.
i asked the other girl to help and she did ok job after words.
it was ok but still  not enough for$55 i paid.
they placed another service request with bob tusky to follow up.
it is now wednesday.
use another company if you want your issue resolved.
i have been to tuffy's twice and have had zero done to my vehicle.
today, i thought i would give them a shot for a basic nc inspection.
i would have to think he saw my registration in hand.
i just fried some hot sausage.....bland.
the same time i bought the sausages i also purchased meatballs.
both use to taste like my mother's and grandmother's.
i will make my own.
the most over priced low quality crap on earth they serve at panera bread.
if you go to panera bread.
start saving your money and get better value elsewhere.
instead of billing healthnet, our insurance, they 'forgot' and billed us instead.
it was covered all along.
why would the do it this way?
we paid nothing.
bigger profit always drives business practices.
just another reason we need single payer in usa.
we only came because a friend raved about the food.
okay 30 min later, food was cold.
not room temperature but ice cold just came out of the fridge chilly.
the cheese wasn't even close to being melted.
what the hell!?
don't go if it's busy.
the bar is only packed because of their gimmicks.
my experience with red carpet vip was pretty bad.
downstairs in the nightclub)i wouldn't recommend them b/c i don't trust them anymore.
not authentic mexican food at all.
i didn't like it one bit.
to each her own though.
danielle was way too pushy.
she refused to listen and kept bugging us to run a credit check.
we walked out.
don't buy from here.
both of us said we would never be back.
mediocre at best.
called back the next day and owner didn't even offer apology.
actually wouldn't accept that there was a problem.
arrogance to say the least.
will never go back here nor recommend anyone waste their money.
don't buy into this time share, ponzi scheme.
save your time and your money.
when we got back we where denied enterance do to 1 small neck tattoo..
at that point they were filling up...discrimination....
do you have it?
poop ass service!
like come on youre on strip.
been eating there at least once a month for well over a year.
don't hink i can eat there again.
everything was stale tonight too.
i ask 3 times ..
no cheese ...
why is it so difficult?
i don't know if they did it on purpose or they just stupid...
this is the worst parking service that exists.
very unorganized as to how the shuttles pick up and drop off.
i waited for 18 minutes until a shuttle showed up.
thank god my flight was delayed!
i would not recommend this service and will definitely not park here again!
most useless customer service blonde chubster girl at the front desk today.
never had someone so lazy to walk over and just play something.
she should work somewhere where she doesnt have to talk to customers.
maybe as the gym janitor?
avoid these guys at all costs.
supposed to be same price with all authorized apple suppliers.
they just lost my business for good.
do not work with francesca gilbert from this company!!!
she is past unprofessional to the buyers of the home as well!
she is not timely, self-absorbed and phony.
i wish i could not give a star at all!!!
i should have read the reviews before i started.
the informed us that they wanted us to pay through their website instead.
i decided that i didn't want to continue because the service was so inconsistent!
they refused to give me my money back!
horrible customer service!!!!
use to love this place and visit at least twice per week...
it's severely declined downhill and the quality of service and food shows it.
but it gets so humid.
i see servers standing and chatting while using menus to fan themselves looking unhappy.
and a happy staff equals happy customers...
oh, and poker nights?
the girl with eyeglasses need to learn at least to greet.
she's rushing people to order.
will not visit this restaurant again.
they should hire more people or schedule more people when it's busy
we were ever hopeful about sampling great tacos!
got there around  2:30pm and the line was gigantic to get in.
maneje casi 1 hora para venir hasta este casino que lastima
the worst pedicure i have ever received.
i filed nails, polish on skin, rough heels...waste of cash
i don't like frys because of there employees being unprofessional.
managers who just are very inappropriate with other employees.
no boundaries sad!
i used this cleaner for about 3 years all was great until.
i received my clothes and it looked like they weren't washed, just ironed.
the armpits had deep wrinkles and smelled of my deodorant.
the cashier said let me give you a refund.
$2 bucks for so much trouble, a ruined $75 silk shirt.
the "who cares" attitude will keep me away forever.
it was a good cleaner until the first time i had a problem.
terrible service time in takeout.
would not recommend getting a cake from here.
not worth the wait.
never have i had to wait for a dessert that long.
the server also did not show interest when we ordered.
absolutely disgusted on how slow the service is.
1 star for now until they start to serve their customers with respect.
i cannot recommend this business in all good consciousness.
boarded at 9:15 am, plane was scheduled to leave at 10:00 am.
i have been sitting on this plane for over an hour!
not to mention the seats dont recline and its filthy in here.
at 10:20am we finally started moving.
drove around in circles on the runway till 10:33 am until taking off.
is this real life?
the waiter was nice, when he was around, which he wasn't very often.
there are really no redeeming qualities to this place, forgettable and overpriced.
can't see them being in business for very long.
yet nothing is said to the lady.
seriously this is a health code violation!
i will not be back.
eventually needed a root canal.
on the way home, i pulled over 3 times to throw up blood/bleach.
i had a bloody nose from all of this too.
this was the worst experience ever.
terrible pool  horrible pool hours closes at 4:00!
the one at is open is a glorified foundation!
food is average in quality and  way over priced for the portion.
the drinks are over priced as well.
2 beers, 2 shots and 2 tiny appetizers cost $51.00 plus tip.
not worth the money.
should have gone to wild wings instead.
this place has really gone downhill.
from the trendy place it used to be to a morgue.
the food is the same, basically okay.
huge turnover, sullen employees have lost me.
never again and i gave them several chances.
service was friendly and fast.
food was pretty terrible and overpriced.
disappointing to say the least.
terrible customer service.
i've been here before, an it's the last time.
i won't be back.
i would not recommend this gym to anyone.
the sales person dave b.
was possibly the rudest person i have ever met.
not at this joint.
customer service is not a priority in this establishment!
waste of $15 the mozzarella sticks were ok.
my nephew wanted milk so my sister went to get it.
worst customer service ever!
and i've worked in customer service most of my life!!!
this place is a joke.
this place sucks ass.
nope 4 days in a row i got frozen eggs on my breakfast sandwich.
never go here again.
we heard great things about this place so we thought we'd try it.
maybe it was a bad night....but we had terrible service and food.
her response was, "would you like to take it to-go"?
um....no, didn't you just hear we said it was terrible?
this place isn't good.
most people can make better italian at home.
basic pasta plates.
i took duck confit which was disappointing.
you know a restaurant is bad when you can make better dishes at home.
decor is bad too.
service is acceptable.
the only positive are the wine portions which are generous.
super sketchy part of town.
they do not do reflexology, just a basic rub..the manager never shuts his mouth.
they hang outside smoking which blows back into the shop.
this could be the worst restaurant i have been to in a long time.
service was beyond bad.
we asked to see the manager who never came out.
save yourself the trouble and go els
chicken wings are not cooked and still had some feathers on them..
very gross, still recovering from food poison from this place.
their customer service is crap.
when i got there i wasn't greeted and i waited for awhile.
he had such a bad attitude.
i decided to not get my photo taken there.
never going back.
went in to buy a matcha iced tea and matcha smoothie for take out.
are you serious?
their ramen is mediocre at best as well.
do yourself a favour and go to kinton ramen down the road.
this place is a train wreck!
the lines they have you stand in are a joke.
wait in one line, then another, then another and even another.
waited in line for no reason.
this dump gets a big fat zero from me.
it's old, it's antiquated & it's staffed by what looks like crack junkies!!
what a bunch of low end poor quality business losers!!
it seems there is either new management or ownership.
the customer service is not good.
two times in a row, they forgot to make one of my pizzas.
i won't be going back.
recently they have changed the coffee, this was not a sound decision.
somebody has fucked this up badly, i am really disappointed in this place.
of all of the things a breakfast should be good for .....coffee.
just walk away.
there is significant extra fees this company tries to get you on.
unlimited miles is 20 a day but it's advertised online to include the miles.
one thing after another they wanted $670 for three days.
nope nope and nope
will not come back
my husband ordered a breakfast sandwich without cheese.
thanks for the lack of customer service!
i read and reread crazy sushi reviews for at least 2 months.
the biggest disappointment of a piece of sushi in my entire life.
the sushi had no taste at all.
please look at other restaurants for good/excellent/fresh sushi!!
sushi was indistinguishable from the rice.
do not go to this hotel .
this hotel really really sucks and their manager cedric is very rude .
we arrived at 12am and was advised to park on the side street.
they didn't even give a damn as to what happened .
they don't care .
they will not compensate us for anything at all !!
they claim it's not their responsibility .
their manager cedric is very condescending !!
this is strictly a review on their lunch sandwiches, which are mediocre.
coffee is coffee, gets the job done here.
go to subway or stick to coffee, just not good at all, for sandwiches.
most importantly, not even tasty, basic, basic sandwich.
last time a visit here.
way too much food, very slow.
staff seemed confused, lost.
what a let down.
unbelievably horrible service!!
there were six of us and it took forever to get our drinks!
plus the kitchen forgot to make one of the dinners!
by the time it came every one else was finished eating!
won't go back!!
i didn't have high hopes to begin with but bushes was still a disappointment.
canes is a much better choice.
husband had the guys original burger.
hey guy,  where's the beef ??
i couldn't be more disappointed with my stay at this disaster of a hotel.
i stayed here for a weekend in late february.
pass on this place, there's plenty more in the area.
wow - really awful.
took fifteen minutes to get three tacos.
and they were not worth the wait.
terrible carwash here.
i got the basic yesterday, and my car came out gritty with dirt streaks.
incredible that it could be so bad.
i read the review about kierra and thought sound she sounded just fine.
in qualified hands my cut is relatively easy.
i completely agree with the other comments about it being a nightmare to leave.
that's where they got us.
i am not sure how she did not notice because it was prerty bad.
went somewhere else to have it fixed.
do not go here.
total rip off.
don't do work you pay for.
bought tires here.
lasted a year.
poor quality product.
supposed to do wheel alignment, didn't.
if i could give this grocery store less than one star i would.
wait times to check out are ridiculous as there are never enough cashiers working.
this particular applebee's is ran very poorly.
we left in a hurry after that.
avoid at all costs
every time i come to this place i'm always disappointed.
i stopped here because i needed coffee stat.
i was the only person in the drive-through.
i placed my order.
one medium coffee with almond milk and one splenda.
i get to the window the lady asked me what my order was.
omg get with it guys.
this is a tourist trap store but don't fall for it!
the staff is rude and does not deserve your money.
find another store for your canada merchandise, i will not be returning tomorrow.
worst decision i ever made was get a membership to massage envy.
save your money and don't waste your time.
also if you cancel you will lose all your credits..
so use them before you cancel.
they are the shipping company for chef'd, a meal delivery service (like blue apron).
twice i tried ordering.
twice ontrac screwed it up and i ended up with no food.
today they posted that i had refused delivery because of a damaged package.
i wasn't home, no one refused anything.
they are appallingly bad.
this place is sexist!
only girls are allowed in the front.
they hide all the guys in the kitchen.
save yourself the money and aggravation and avoid pizza 17
change the damn hours on here, they're not open at 1145pm let alone 1.
yelp quit wasting my fucking time
i know there are wicked people in the world but i'm an honest one.
then melissa and matt the 2 managers wanted to side with security.
well they are unaware that i'm gonna call the corporate office on them.
phone number for barnes and noble corp office 2126333300.
tell them  wanna report matt and melissa the 2 managment staff.
for whiskey being in the name they have a horrible selection to choose from.
felt like our server didn't want to serve us or help us at all.
order took over 1 hour for our food.
they brought our dessert first before the meal.
it happens everytime we come here.
food was burnt and didnt taste good.
beware about leaving tips they will change the amount.
i am referring to the emerald suites located at paradise rd.
that man is a genius.
betty is a very rude employee bitching behind my back?
if you want betty bitching behind your back come to this kohl's.
crpes moyennes, les saveurs sont dcevantes par rapport  mes attentes..
paris crpes n'a rien avoir avec les crpes parisiennes.
les prix sont excessivement cher par rapport  la qualit de la crpe..
are their managers.
one of the worst breakfasts i've had.
waitress and "chef" had no idea what over medium  egg was.
what kind of breakfast place doesn't know how to do this???
not even a discount offered.
didn't offer to reheat the rest of my cold breakfast waiting for their eggs.
so much for even trying this place.
hear the food is lousy & service bad anyway.
we were very very dissatisfied.
back in the days it was great here.
buffet was really terrible and very expensive this saturday night.
seafood tasted old and seemed like it has been frozen for a long time.
prime rib was bloody and had to be grilled.
service was ok but not superb.
self serve on drinks.
i'm not sure if buffets are similar to other hotels.
he just sent me a sketch of a completely different flower.
bad customer service, bad design, bad attitude.
i don't recommend this place at all.
went into the store a week ago and there was only one person working.
the other person was on lunch.
i had to wait 15 minutes for service.
she would stop helping me and help them.
not a good first impression when you are signing up as a new customer.
shouldn't you have known this before.
worried i made the wrong decision here.
for the price it's not worth it.
just don't waste your time and money.
the food is average, you can get better with that price.
if i had an option to not even give them a star i would.....
cold food, dry meat,  partially cooked pasta, dry desserts.
i'm glad it was at least edible...
but having flys on my food is no bueno......
they put thinner in my nail polish so it would last like a day.
my manicure was overpriced and was definitely not worth the price.
never once did she say she was sorry or tried to make it right...
she obviously could care a less and was actually rude.
i will never go back!
big fat 0 stars.
2017 spring race is disappointing at best.
no on site store.
no propane sales.
an ice truck that has no attendants.
but let me guess...you want more money for your tickets!
shame on you...you don't deserve 2 races nor the ticket sales.
i think they wants to keep collecting interest i guess.
but i will never ever used this bank again.
please avoid this bank.
the venue is really cool!...and i really liked the place...until i got thirsty.
$6 for a water though?
this might be the nastiest place i've ever eaten at.
the salsa comes steaming hot for some reason.
beans were dryer than the nevada desert itself.
i just wanted a chicken chimichanga.
they use that warm stadium-grade nacho cheese that tastes like kraft singles.
we booked a 7 day vacation to the venetian.
they sent someone to file a claim.
i don't know his name but he works night time.
i felt so uncomfortable because my daughters heard them.
food arrived 1 hour and 45 mins late.
we called 2xlast call we made, they hung up.
they refused to refund and take the food back.
never buying from this place again.
been a loyal customer since 2012.
it's not the first time  this kind of bad service  happened.
for $17 club sandwich,  toast was burnt and way too much lettuce and tomatoes.
sorry to say but the rio is getting over on people at this place.
i purchased a groupon for two hours of moving services for $199.
that nearly doubles the cost.
what's the point of the groupon at this point?
what a scam.
warning: check your credit card statement!
they are con artists!
a friend and i had lunch here.
increasing the amount after we leave is simply deceptive.
the food is mediocre and, as other reviewers state, the service is poor.
i will certainly not be back.
i hope that bitchy pit boss has been fired by now.
perhaps her name was shirley?
she was just terrible.
i was on time and filled out same paper work i did two earlier.
sat in waiting for 45 min with no one saying anything.
normally i'm sure this place is great but today was horrible.
who wants to hear your vomiting and rabble while i'm getting a massage.
bottom line if you want a quality massage this isn't the place.
hit or miss for service, have had good service and poor.
just stay away from this place.
awful rendition of indian food.
horribly slow service and very rude staff.
please take it already".
the samosas and chicken biryani is just not eatable.
please don't spoil your vegas experience by visiting this place.
i even said no to a pap this year just in case!
i'm of trini decent.
caribbean people love their fried plantain.
i was told that this place bakes theirs, so i gave it a try.
i was given a box of charcoal.
people, go to one love vegetarian on bathurst north of bloor.
this store is horribly mismanaged.
the place was half full for lunch on a saturday.
umm, i have been here for less than 30 seconds.
we asked her to give us a minute.
twelve minutes later, i was watching her check people out, touch tables, etc.
yet still did not come back for our order.
we gave it another 2-3 minutes....bye!
this place is a roach motel.
they claim their apartments are remodeled, but they are simple horrible.
they look good from a distance.
very disappointed to have my family here this easter.
service was horrible.
the one star was for the sweet hostess
not the mark taylor residential experience i'm used to.
moved here recently and haven't had the best experience.
be prepared to be nickel and dimed.
went fo4 a blow dry.
there was only one employee.
i guess i had the wrong definition on liquidation.
i will not return to this "liquidation" store again.
apparently that was to difficult of a order.
they even added a extra ingredient, hair on one of the hot dogs.
last time i ever come here
everything started great.
the black dude was the bartender.
which was a dick from the moment i walked in.
i wouldn't recommend this place to anyone i know.
would never recommend phillys to anyone
this pharmacy is terrible!
it didn't work at all made me sick and now i'm pregnant.
he described them as two hispanic women who said i would be fine.
wish i could have 0 stars
frozen, fatty chicken breast.
threw it away after a couple bites.
this is now called blue sky nail salon.
i will not be going back.
they never bothered to call me, or offer me another stylist.
my wait would have been an hour and a half.
something similar to this happened a few months ago also.
the food is just plain bad.
the service was passable but the food was terrible.
understaffed , undertrained and billing office soooo confused.
to my surprise, jeffrey said after my haircut, the cost is $40 !
please be sure to confirm the price before you sit down in the chair.
we always come here and eat ...
very disappointed with new management ..
i've been back 3 times because of rude, uncaring employee encounters.
bill waited on me, and transaction was like working with a robot.
no information, no receipt, no sign of caring.
i won't go back.
if i didn't already have service here, i'd switch today.
strongly recommend you manage your account and orders online.
service is complete trash.
staff is so disorganized and inefficient.
i will never go back.
avoid at all costs.
there are many similar style places in charlotte that are wayyy better.
the agreement was that an estimate would follow the next day.
a few days later i called again, not having heard back.
this place is the worst place i have been to in a while.
and on top of the that they added an extra dollar charge inside.
so why do you guys still have the sign up?!
they have a outdated menu which they do not honor.
the customer service is horrible.
it's pretty much no service or the bare minimum to get the customers money.
i do no recommend coming to this place at all.
worst altitude restaurant every been, just don't go and get yourself mad.
food is just plain nothing special
worst wendy's i have ever had.
nothing was fresh.
individual tacos start at $3 ...
our waiter, while nice and pretty up on refilling drinks, was otherwise terrible.
after talking with the manager those excess charges were removed.
dinner here was a real comedy of errors.
this place has zero customer service skills.
i placed an order on may 21 and still have not received any thing.
today is june 27!
i called this office a few months back.
the vet never did call me back.
i was disappointed with this.
and they lost a potential client.
don't bother going to this car wash.
this guy would not give up and after being annoyed i went somewhere else.
if you like being annoyed by salesman then this is the place for you.
my experience with oak bank has been less than ideal.
the bank made a mistake on a mortgage and didn't transfer a property correctly.
i will not be recommending this bank to anyone again.
i've tried this place twice both times with mediocre results.
the pizza is at best below average.
the pizza was dry with poor quality ingredients.
don't waste your money or time.
inconsistent quality and service for the price.
$50 pedicure and $100 facials call for dependable services.
all my pedis here have been horrible.
you can imagine my discomfort.
i hope this is just a coincidence!
but it made me curious what they added into the food now.
dr webber is the worst....
we love dr.mendoza!
never again i will take my son elsewhere if it comes down to it.
please dr webber learn bedside manner!
we love seafood and last time we ate here we were so disappointed!
the freshness is gone.
this used to be the best seafood buffet but it is no longer!
the sushi was okay and shrimp dishes were okay but not worth the price!
this was the best deal for lobster but sadly we won't be back!
terrible customer service .
people park in the grass, on the curbs, everywhere because there is 0 spots.
i have spent $470 on parking tickets/tow expenses in 6 months.
might i add...
hvac doesn't work.
don't live here if you don't have to....
it is lousy service for mediocre food
the hotel and downtown scottsdale!
also good luck understanding them.
it's very difficult if you are older.
it's become like a meat factory herding people through.
it's really gone downhill!!!
i went to this dim sum with my colleagues.
at that time, not just me, everyone felt insulted at that time.
still, we managed to leave the tips on the table.
even the illegal workers.
me and my colleagues will not come to this place again!!
thank you, summit garden!
today, we ordered the mediterranean and paid $10 for it.
don't like your job?
get another one.
the miserable attitude carries out.
this place is crazy!!!
maybe it's because it summer time, but they need more staff.
terrible business practice to turn away customers before posted hours of business.
will be using amazon online ordering from now on.
if i could give negative ten i would.
there is spots that she assured us would go away.
they never did.
used to be a favorite place of mine, but not anymore.
the last three times i went, grill marks on steak are burnt.
they taste bitter.
they must have a great business when they can turn away a paying customer.
the sauce has no flavor except tomatoes....no spice nothing.
the sausage was tasteless and awful flavored.
the cheese tasted like a big glob of tasteless cheese.
two thumbs down
very poor value for price paid and when they write fresh fish everyday.
they might mean fresh frozen products as most of the dishes are tasteless.
please improve the dessert section too!!
you have much better option in vegas for $50 per person...
i have been here 3 times and each time was an unfriendly experience.
miserable, would describe her best, she should not work with the general public.
lawrenceville is a great community with some pretty awesome local businesses.
also, the cake is overpriced and really doesn't taste that good.
not here i got an evil look with attitude never again!
would not recommend ordering lunch to go.
greasy grilled cheese sandwich and tomato soup was just ok.
going in to the room we were overwhelmed with the awful smell of cleaner!!
a sweet disgusting smell of cleaner  not a felling clean kind!
off to the pool-no towels available-we asked 3 times-never to get any!
they were not in the wagon as we were told twice!
over all-terrible experience-dirty-gross and ill never be back!
i called 5 times and left 3 messages with my callback info and nothing!
the prices are absurdly high for the portions you get.
i had the beef tacos.
to be avoided
sad to say our experience had been bad!
can tell the difference of red stain and green mold..
do not go here!!
their topcoat is cheap and crappy.
after writing an amazing review last time we used the catering again.
boy that was a mistake.
second time was so so disappointing.
brisket  was so bland and fatty.
the beans came out of a can.
the potato salad was obviously old no one even ate it.
here i had bragged to my guests how good it was.
major  major poor quality.
the ribs were cold and meatless.
not going to have this again.
if you want to be treated fairly, don't come to this establishment.
and the wait has been crazy!
please do one of two things...
allow reservation or open a second day for lunch!
we were asked to show our receipt!!!
customer service should be first, unfortunately we did not get a good service.
we hope ncounter improve in that aspect.
a very stressful experience for the men in our wedding party.
would never use this place again.
don't stay here.
seriously, find another place to stay.
the staff doesn't care about your business or what type of room you booked.
make it your preference to choose a different hotel.
he is saying do what ever you want.
scorpions everywhere ...
i've killed 6 in my first month.
scorpion molting all over my patio ...
open gates all day and night.
worst decision to lease here ever.
they will bait and switch you.
document all your conversations and get names.
worst citibank ever.
avoid this branch or just citibank altogether.
after they closed my branch on jones the overall service level is just horrendous.
can i give negative stars??
the shittiest food i have ever had!!
don't go ever!
isn't that what yelp is for?
be wise when choosing a dentist!
another example of why we have happily switched dentists.
i'm  so fucking upset i've sobered up.
i'm so upset this is a fucking waste.
will never come here again.
the other people at my table are equally pissed.
never coming here again.
who does that?
"this what you order!
i no make wrong!
i wouldn't recommend this place or go here again.
our waitress was really great though!
we loved her.
everything else was quite subpar.
worst bank ever.
finally got it to work and put my money in and left to work.
worst service ever.
do not open up anything with them!!!
when i was just trying to get my dog food for my dog.
the employees are neither effective nor friendly.
have messed up my simple order every time i've been to this location.
half of the add-ins were empty and none of the fruit looked fresh.
won't make this mistake again because i won't be back.
it was so strong that it made me gag!
i immediately left and decided to cook at home.
i was shocked at the patrons eating that didn't find the smell a problem.
tonight was my last time that i will be going there.
new management changed the rules for happy hour.
horrible customer service!
food and service are both horrible.
drive the extra miles to the other one in henderson!
you have lost a customer there's other places
pretty awful service.
i waited 20 minutes for one mcchicken  sandwich!!!!!
that's supposed to be fast food?
it's an airport i know but you can get a good meal ......
just not at this place.
the chicken tacos are horrible, the fries i'm sure are form yesterday: service?
we had made a reservation @ los dos for 9 people including 2 children.
no apology was offered.
the app marked it was delivered and it never arrived!!
nobody answered the phone.
i am super disappointed and extremely hungry!
unhappy with the service and the delivery driver.
no, no, no and no.
no more cheap beer!!!!
we are waiting for the next ownership change before going back.
this was absolutely the worst burrito i've ever had ever!!
it was gross!!
i will say the rice was okay.
sandwich hadn't even been started but i was still pleasant no worries.
got my money back will not be going back.
the size of this store and they don't have one pot to cook in..
never coming back..
smiths and albertsons would have this..
should have broadcast a different recorded message if closed or out of business.
went to see a concert on aug 4th.
you will not enjoy the show because the environment is uncomfortable.
make sure you dont tumble down those stairs!!!
the stairs on the 2nd floor of the arena are rather steep.
it is hard to carry especially food and beverages down those steep stairs.
but you have a nice one too
this was terrible.
either way, i left hungry and didn't like it at all!
not good business at all.
sun was down....people waiting outside for a table...they had enough business....redic.
the owner knows how to make a pizza.
the rude kids who work their are useless.
very few options.
definitely not worth the money i paid...
the owner ruined my favorite shirt!
don't take anything here you aren't able to replace!!
also took forever for them to get us a warranty on the part.
all in all, awful experience.
one star is generous.
terrible customer service.
they don't explain the warranties or explain the repairs.
service reps are rude and not well trained.
because of this place i'll go with mercedes next.
this is after 3 bmw's.
i thought it was strange but went with it.
the lady who sat me said it'd be no longer than 15 mins.
another 10-15 mins goes by with no nail tech.
i give up, put on my shoes and leave.
would not recommend this place and the cleanliness was concerning.
it's a awful place ever, we went there five times, and four times closed.
how can a restaurant always closed????????????
i was not satisfied with the quality of service.
the staff did not adhere to the time schedule.
it was the worst experience i have ever encounter...
the next day, around 11:00 am, the delivery guy shows up with dead flowers.
love the name!
we have tried this place several times because we love the name.
unfortunately, the name is not enough.
the service is terrible.
the food is adequate not worth the bad service.
turn and run!!!!!
not to mention all the mold that is still there!!!!
amanda "the assistant manager" is the biggest witch you can come across!
i'm so glad to be done with them because they suck!
you're better off living in a box!
once again anyone thinking about this place, run for the hills!
they should rename this place yucky yucky!
nasty ass food, restaurant looks as if they live there.
you'll get better chinese at your kids school cafeteria.
got seated fairly quickly but waited an hour for food.
food was tasty if overpriced when it arrived.
i had expected higher quality food prep for the price.
did have cheque discounted and tipped our server well.
she earned it tonight!
super salty soup(no free rice served).
even the food court at the green land korean market is way much better!
plus it's tooo loud!
in a word, horrible.
everyone there seemed to care less about my pain.
they appear to be across the street from one another.
they're incompetent and make fun of the dying patients in the icu!
unless you have a death wish, stay far away!!!!
terrible experience at this hotel.
hotel bed was not even, with a huge indentation on one side.
really not impressed with this location at all.
we will take our business to the jareds on n rainbow instead.
hmmm where to start.
being positive, the food was good and the coffee was hot.
but my service, man it was horrible.
the female waitress wasn't friendly at all.
although the food was great, i won't return because of the bad service.
been to quite a few johnny rockets but never one like this.
it's like a fancy overpriced mcdonald's.
employees were yelling and carrying on in the kitchen.
will not be going here again.
the manager, kristan i believe horrible communication skills and customer service.
i'm not a complainer but everything went wrong trying to book the event.
i worked in resultant industry for years and really just disappointed.
won't be coming back.
limited desert station served only soft serve ice cream, chocolate mouse, and creme brulee.
this has to be the worst buffet i've ever eaten at.
i wouldn't eat here again even if the food was free.
i love pizza hut but i can't stand having to deal with this store.
so i guess i just can't order pizza hut anymore.
worst customer service ever!
if i could i wouldn't even give them one star.
this will be the last time i come eat here.
this is the worst so-called semi-private club ever!
nothing special being a member.
pro shop does not know how to manage the rotation of three nine holes.
no, marshall, no starter but at least a beverage cart.
would not recommend becoming a member.
i have never had so many issues trying to schedule an appointment.
very frustrating and bad business practices!
i bought a groupon and due to lack of response it's now expired.
ridiculously unprofessional, unreliable, and unable to handle even the simplest of billing transactions.
such a disgrace to las vegas, such a stereotype of sketchy vegas businesses.
to clean up?
no one is customer service oriented anymore!
wow this place is bad - even by airport standards.
i just walked away moments ago after sitting for 15 minutes.
ignored by two waitstaff.
waiting at the waitstaff station did zero good.
the worst breakfast wrap i've ever eaten.
the tortilla was rubbery, the eggs looked fake and the sausage was bland.
i can't believe i spent $11 on that sorry excuse for breakfast.
do not order the breakfast wrap unless you want to be disappointed.
tired pizza and tired owner.
by far better..
i was really disappointed because the service here was rhorrible.
the short hispanic girl has a nasty attitude and no customer service skills.
but the tall women was very nice.
the gucamole was disgusting because it was made with too much bad onions.
i've been sick ever since.
worst manager i have ever had the i pleasure of dealing with.
i called to ask how much a manicure and pedicure would be.
she explained that they don't do combo packages.
i told her what the manager, diana, had said about the price.
it was a very unprofessional experience from beginning to end.
i will not be going back...nor will i include any hashtags in this review.
would not recommend.
my dishwasher is stopping mid-cycle.
they sent the same guy out two times.
save yourself the headache and call the manufacturer directly.
these people don't care about your time either.
on second visit he stayed 25 minutes.
i have no plans to ever order from this establishment again
this by far is the worst home warranty company i have ever dealt with.
i initially picked them because they are a local company located in gilbert.
i would never recommend this company and have since cancelled my service with them.
apple butter burger was full of fat and tasted so gamey!
bun was way too big.
sauce was a regular bbq.
go check out hero burger or mushkaki instead.
you're even better off going to burger factory.
i have been twice and both times i had terrible service.
the first time i went in for happy hour with a group of 5.
i will not return to public school 702.
never coming back.
the service is the only good thing.
well good luck trying to find a seat.
i hate the assigned seating.
rude...i'd rather be told we're closed....
3 people in lobby.
1 hour wait.
they don't take appointments for x-rays.
here with a child, this will not go well.
receptionist called neighboring simonmed.
40 minute wait, why don't you go there.
forget that, 10 minute drive almost same time.
why is place understaffed?
why do they want to get rid of patients?
hate this place.
it's a big rip off
to bad there is not a less than one star.
the customer service is not there.
this is stupid.
you come out to a house that my company manages.
you fix the garage door and then it stops working again.
then you come out less than 30 days later and replace the garage remotes.
problem is still there.
once you fix the problem correctly i will make this is a 5 star.
absolutely terrible support.
didn't honor a coupon when they ran out bread bowls.
don't waste your time.
blame rosie the manager.
this is why i stopped eating here.
crap food, poor management.
been flying for over 30 years and this is the worst airline by far.
it is all bait and switch.
they will try to pick your pockets to pay for everything.
i won't be coming back here.
everything looks nice but the taste is not very good.
the meal just tasted fake.
got the sultana kebab.
perhaps it was not cooked or had gone bad not sure.
it tasted great going down though.
i think i have eaten here multiple times and not gotten sick.
i ordered online.
one is working and the other 2 are standing around.
i tell them i placed an online order.
they look stumped.
the start looking around for an order and find it on the printer.
one of them hop to it and start making my sandwich.
freaky fast my behind!
that has all changed.
my wife and i ordered breakfast, asking for crispy hash browns.
what once was the best breakfast spot in scottsdale is now a glorified dennys.
if i could give it a zero i would.
i have always loved arby's since i was a little girl.
this last experience at this arby's turned my stomach.
i got my usual arby's roast beef combo with poppers.
my husband called the manager and explained what had happen.
arby's has just gone down hill.
to bad, only fast food i ever ate.
sadly there was little enjoyment to this visit.
the wait was nearly ridiculous, the taco shells were stale.
they couldn't even get the sauces that they asked twice about correct.
it's almost like they do it on purpose.
i'm not usually in southern illinois, if you are i  would avoid this place.
the cleanliness may be questionable also.
bad service - refused to use any coupons even though they were still valid.
when i asked to speak to the manager he refused to come out.
the restaurant was dead and it was a saturday night.
not good customer service at all.
food lacks care - looks like it was thrown on a plate.
ate here once, the food was horrible, portions were microscopic.
try it if you don't believe.
this place has horrible customer service!
i will not return here.
tokyo express was the place to go in phoenix for teriyaki chicken years ago.
sad state that are in.
why and how can you ruin a place like this?
beware, in my opinion there are better places out there for japanese food.
this is the single worst japanese restaurant i've ever been to.
the salad and miso soup were inedible, extremely salty.
the teppaniyaki was just okay, not worth the price.
if i could give less that a star i would.
i ordered my food at 10:30am and it's 1:00 now.
there is absolutely no excuse for this.
management and ownership should be ashamed of the service they are putting out.
in short drive somewhere else!
because i just ate there and the pizza was bad.
but the guy next to me his looked really good.
the person that was working was his personal waitress thou.
if you try it go to the one on ray road,  it's better.
o what sauce ?
this place is awful.
it's only like 4 blocks away from where i live.
starbucks corp should do something.
do they really want to continue their negative rep?
i'm sad to even say i live so close.
little fillings and lots of rice!
ordered the baked sushi and it was burnt sticking to the aluminum foil!
not planning on returning!
i came here alone and got all you can eat sushi.
won't be coming here again.
there was never a smile in this woman's voice the entire time.
i almost felt like i was bothering her!
she quoted $55 for an hour of massage or facial.
not a good first impression folks.
when we decide on a spa day, we will be looking elsewhere.
worst set of acrylics i have ever had.
received a full set on sunday by wednesday my nails were already lifting horribly.
bad service, cheap products.
will not be returning, i should have checked yelp before ever coming here!
got a to good to be true flier in the mail.
be very careful
ordered filet mignon that came with a vegetable medley and skinny fries.
i just need extra vacuuming, not any pet friendly deodorizer or protectant.
i probably will not return to this car wash again unfortunately.
this is the worst malaysian food i ever ate in my life.
this place is ridiculous!!
long story short..
cold stone blows!!
very upset about having my event here.
however there was very little wiggle room to socialize.
the night manager was very rude accusing us of "stressing out" the waitress.
she was not open or receptive to any ideas.
server was nice but clearly hates her job.
elite bridal also sells on ebay.
what a liar
not happy drinks suck!!!
i couldnt even finish my bloody mary...
food just ok.
lv locations are sooooo much better.
you would think scottsdale would be better than this!!!
not going back.
it's pretty much leaf blower city.
it starts at 8.30am and seriously does not stop.
literally 6 days a week.
is there a rating less than one?
worst dentistry ever!!
they don't care about patients and they make the situation as tough as possible.
is that a joke??
receptionist is unprofessional and rude.
how long will it take the doctor to approve and release my xrays?
dont ever visit this place again!
they continue to escalate.
food was food nothing special.
deffintly would not eat again..
not worth the money..
many more places to eat in vegas if u wanna spend $50
won't come back again....
now i believe it with my own expericne.
this was the worst buffet i have ever been to in las vegas.
came at 12:15 for lunch.
my husband doesn't eat any of their meats except the steak.
we were told we could wait twenty minutes for them to make more.
we won't be back unless something seriously improves.
i thought the food was very subpar.
after that i spoke to the owner and he just ignored my comment/concern.
i will never go back again!
then, i got there.
it was terrible.
then, when you get there they are very rushed and rude.
and none of the cars were cleaned.
who wants to drive a dirty rental car?
my first experience was with jenni, it was fast but kind of incomplete.
you could tell she wasn't thrilled to do my nails.
i went back two weeks later to see a different nail tech, shelby.
my nails were done perfect!
such a cute salon turned into a sad over priced chop shop.
if i could give it zero stars i would.
horrible customer service.
they bend over backwards to charge you excessively.
the gym is always densely packed so you can forget getting a workout in...
also disgustingly dirty!
stay far away!
terrible, terrible service!!!!!
i do not recommend any travelers to eat here.
the only thing they really have going for them is the mac 'n cheese.
again i do not recommend this place to travelers.
i have not been so annoyed, irritated, and angry when leaving a food joint.
had victory bowl as it was recommended by the cash staff.
$16 w/ tax.
it's a shame, when the food is good but the service is lacking.
burger was dry and really not good.
have eaten at guys restaurant on carnival cruise lines and it was the best.
disappointed this time.
the staff is lazy and rude.
the 7th street and mcdowell location is the worst.
now that i think about it, the whole meal is dry and tasteless.
maybe i went at the wrong time.
guy only had 3 tables.
his greeting was, are you ready to order?
we asked for salad, dressing on the side.
salad then took forever.
food came slow and was cold.
this just affirmed my decision to stop eating out.
will be filing a claim with my credit card company for a refund.
my suggestion would be to go someplace more reputable to buy your furniture.
ok.  this place isn't exactly open to 12.
just went by and they actually stop serving at 11.30.
not sure why they don't just say that.
travelled quite a ways to be here so a bit disappointed.
unfortunately, we were disappointed with this flemings location due to the poor service.
we were not greeted or offered beverage service after sitting in the bar area.
a simple glass of water would have been great.
we left after 6 minutes of this lack of attention.
this restaurant is like a nightmare!
the service was so slow and there was almost nobody there!
it's not a chinese restaurant at all!
the strip mall they are in is a very bad place also
i wish i could give this place a zero!
waited 10 mins to order a drink.
had to ask for refills!
waited 45 mins for food and only got it after asking for it.
had to get our own silverware & napkins.
waiter had major attitude!
manager was accomadating but doesn't make up for poor service.
they are beyond slow and not one once of customer service
restaurant look disgusting smell weird .
chicken was uncooked rice was hard .
for sure i did not  going back again.
thought i'd give this place one last chance....
as my last two visits was a nightmare.
thought the drive through pulled in 5:50 pm no one in front.
speaker garbled words placed order after several repeats.
went to inside to get forgotten items......food was warm but not hot.
so i called back, and the girl doesn't even bother to apologize or anything.
they did have the car.
horrible customer service.
this place is shady.
i've never seen a business do such a shady thing.
save your money & find a more reputable business.
obviously the sales a hole gets a commission when he sells bundles.
stay away from this unethical company!!
food was awful.
place wasn't very clean.
do not come here.
the waitress was an angry, frowning person.
my house salad was warm, mushy and drenched in some kind of mayonnaise dressing.
don't even bother getting them.
i've only seen them at walmart.
they taste old, crumbly.
i do not recommend this place to anyone.
poor customer service, poor management, horrible pizza!!!
save your money and do yourself a favor by never eat at grazie!!!
bad news if you're a buyer:  he'd sell his own mother for a commission.
even clicked the call server button on their table tablets.
used to be a reliable fave when working here.
positively lousy the other day.
cold and tasteless.
time to close
shawn is a dishonest salesman.
all i can say is i am never going back to this location.
it's just a really sad situation bc shawn is a sales manager for them.
don't say i didn't warn you!
it's 5:30 am at the airport and they are not open for breakfast.
the deli next door is open and has a nice breakfast.
chick-fillet is open.
cinabun is open.
the smoothie place is open.
why not uptown?
it may be because it's a bar and can't open due to local laws.
maybe they cannot figure out keep the bar part closed while serving restaurant patrons?
hopefully the airport moves my flights out of this terminal while they renovate it.
maybe there will be a restaurant open at 5:30 for a standard breakfast.
service was poor.
not enough wait staff for number of patrons.
fries were frozen and fried with same texture as mcdonald's fries.
also they were soggy.
not worth the price and will not return.
put prices on your vehicles and maybe people will be interested.
stop trying to trick people and waste there time pulling them into your building.
ive been coming here since it opened and always had gpod service.
today, i was waiting so long my water was cold.
they took two others after me.
i loved the way tamy did my nails but they lost my business today.
currently at the drive thru.
the lady had me wait  almost 5 min to just order.
she said "she was by herself".
now i'm waiting behind only two cars and we aren't moving.
this is ridiculous and the management should be ashamed of themselves.
having only one work at lunch hour?????
drive thrus at fast food places should be super quick.
it shouldn't take a half hour to get a damn smoothie.
i would never use again.
this is the last time i get my prescriptions here.
i'm not buying it...
walgreen's seems like a much better option for me.
i would recommend not coming to this cvs!!!!
this place use to be my favorite boba spot...
i walked in and the menu is completely different!!!
i had to walk out.
this used to be a childhood memory.
and now i would not recommend this place to any one!
bmw las vegas sold a non-bmw vehicle at their tent sale.
supposed to get free oil changes for a year.
adam, the service manager, horrible person to work with.
eric the new general manager is horrible!!
go to another bmw dealership in the area.
they aren't good for nothing and are sleezy.
how could this be...
i dont get it and both times they dont seem very apologetic about..
oh well, we can give your $$ back, but that is not the point...
not worth the dissapointment.
i went yesterday and had gobi manchurian, mysore dosa.
the manchurian was bland and i could taste the flour in it.
dosa was equally tasteless.
i have been there before and it had pretty good dosa's.
dunno what happened.
i could have saved more money with pods then getting a rental truck.
i'm just glad its over and pissed i use my money for their services..
do not use them for a long distance move!
very upsetting and i will not return.
it's very hot in there  as well and the ac wasn't even on barely.
he had the doors open.
you have to pay for your own water which is a water bottle.
i wish them the best of luck
only gets one star because it's maybe the worst service i've had in awhile.
i have received some shoddy service from this store on more than one occasion.
i bought new nokian winter tires and rims.
i returned it and learned the rims were bent.
the technician installed bent rims.
on another occasion, the technician didn't return my lug nuts after a tire swap.
the "little"girl who works there has no manners...
her mamma obviously didn't teach her a thing.
public storage should reconsider on keeping her employed.
we had to wait while they obviously had to make the correct order .
no apologies or explanation of why we had to wait!!!!
i'd give negative stars if it was an option.
total wait 40 minutes.
we followed the address on yelp and it took us to a neighborhood.
did not find the food truck at all
on hold for over 50 minutes...
what a disappointment to how an actual business should be ran.
one of the worst customer service situations i've encountered...
and i've encounted some pretty terrible ones.
we had a burger and country steak, both where absolutely terrible.
and we barely finished then.
i am sure they get a kickback from the bank for the business.
i ordered butterfish sushi and it was hard and chewy!!
i had to spit it out over fear of getting sick.
all the other sushi tasted like the ingredients were old.
for the price they charge you are better off going somewhere else.
will not return!
we popped in on, saturday night, 9-14-18 at about 9:00pm.
we were wrong.
the cooks were already cleaning up the kitchen.
as far as the entrees go.....it was orange chicken or nothing.
basically out of everything.
they refused to cook anything further.
the gal who dished up for us looked embarrassed and apologized.
what a joke.
however whole experience was a nightmare coz of waitress who was utterly cold.
noticed one family left before even ordering.
we ordered chicken wings for snacks which apparently were cold.
so instead we requested to change with nachos.
i am going back to vegas in aug but never going back there
this place is terrible!
i made a purchase and the product was faulty.
their signature dish "chicken parm" tasted like it was frozen and reheated.
the sauce was disgusting.
the same items online, amazon and ebay are more than half the cost.
also if you are looking for friendly customer service, go elsewhere.
nice service but 30 minutes for fast food?
kind of disappointing...
the other chick fil a's are sooo much faster.
this happened to me twice already.
i'm definitely avoiding her next time!
i guess we don't f***ing learn.
they charged her for 4 mcmuffins and gave her only two.
down to one star.
i went to mme lee a couple of weeks ago for the first time.
she subsequently asked me for the $5 for cover.
we left and i won't be returning.
understaffed,service was awful,way overpriced!!
out of everything!!
don't spend a dime here
9 dollars for a torta!!!
and they only give you 3 slices of avocado!!
my take out order was missing items.
staff was inattentive.
management refused to help.
waited close to 40 minutes for the food to be ready.
when i got home there was no soup in the bag.
i was perfectly clear with chad the bartender that i wanted soup and tacos.
won't be coming back here again.
service was rushed and unfriendly.
first course was so salty it was unedible.
with so many good restaurants in vegas i would say skip this one!!!
came here on a double date for valentine's day.
and i really can't even tell you who our waiter actually was.
so thank you, staff at mr. chow las vegas, for ruining our valentine's dinner.
spend your money elsewhere....or at least wait until they get their act together.
i have gone back to try the food out again!!
this time the wings!!
the beer is good but wayyyyyy overpriced, never again!!!
the service always disappoints every single time.
as much as i enjoy the tacos, i'll never go back.
horrible drive thru customer service.
after waiting for 5 minutes, someone finally responds on the speaker.
the experience at the vegas location was not so memorable.
the service was horrible.
the food was unusual for us but tasty and very very expensive.
ridiculous it's been a month.
nobody calls me and when i call them they don't seem to care.
terrible terrible service avoid at all costs.
wish i could give no stars!
they were scheduled to come today between 2-4.
it is now 5:20 and still no call and no one has come.
glad i wasted my entire afternoon waiting for someone who never showed up.
guess i now know why they are cold calling looking for customers!
i'm gonna go with a no on this one...
i have been to dick's before and i get the gimmick...
but when the waiter walked across our table with his dirty a$$ shoes...
i get restaurant themes...
but i did come to eat.
you can't mess with that.
it sure wasn't like it used to be.
the service was horrible.
i was tempted to walk to wendy's to get drinks for my family.
i will never return.
our waiter was a man named "brian" who was pretty sharp and rude.
the food was mediocre.
anyway our friends had recommended this restaurant so highly that we were pretty disappointed.
very surprising from a business that seems to be soliciting yelp reviews.
never have i ever had good service here.
i'm not a needy customer, but i at least expect the bare minimum.
we ordered our food before 2 other tables and got our food last.
the food came out incorrectly.
so disappointed in red robin.
and she wouldn't even call the manager.
not even one employee asked if they could help us.
terrible customer service and extremely rude employees!
the groomer approached and pulled a dog back by the tail!!!!
he then lied about it and said he pulled the dog by the hips!!!!
a dog is to be moved by command or by the collar only.
do not trust your dog to this salon.
this search has taken me to local shops, which has been pretty cool.
unfortunately, this place was below the bar for my group.
nevermind the paper cups - it wasn't a huge deal.
nope, this review is entirely for the service.
the service was dismissive and rude.
it seemed like an inconvenience for her that she had customers to tend to.
this was the worst nail salon i've ever been to!!
it's way over priced for a crap nail job.
i will never go back there.
save your money
i would definitely not recommend core
veal sandwich was very weak!
this place should just close!!.
that dude owes me a lunch.
i recommend you give this place a pass!!
do not get a hair detox.
absolutely bad business and a waste of $250.
absolutely dissatisfied and will be letting people know of this.
could be better.
you could hear her cussing several aisles away.
glad i didn't have kids with me.
recently, i was there and they had a giant line.
one lady opened her lane so me and another lady went over there.
it was really unprofessional.
boycotting this one for a while.
my fries were cold!!
so disappointing, and my burger was good, but did not feel fresh.
i was planning on bringing customers to this place for lunch, but not anymore.
worst experience in vegas ever.
don't stay here if you want to have fun and be treated well.
they have gone down hill since they first opened.
pools all closed for maintenance, check in service is miserable.
follow up doesn't happen.
the sheets are itchy and scratchy.
how does a high end hotel have bad sheets ?
we got there a 2:00 am on a saturday.
save your selves the headache and don't bother going to this place.
was it because i was in target for 2 1/2 hours straight?
really annoying and uncomfortable.
it was the most awkward unpleasant shopping trip ever.
the man that works here is one of the worst manicurists.
he rubbed my skin raw and told me i was just being too sensitive.
he rushed through the whole process and burned through my nail a few times.
he kept glueing my skin to the nail.
he nicked me with the grinder countless times.
only redeeming factor was his wife did an ok job with the polish.
which was still thin enough to see through ...
very dirty and the staff was obviously sick.
he then wiped his nose on his sleeve, that's when i had enough!
the smell in the salon was horrible.
i understand people get sick, but call in sick please!
we were so not pleased with this experience.
first, the buns were so hard and dry i could hardly choke mine down.
i ordered the chicken sandwich with bleu cheese.
the chicken breast was tiny...smaller than the palm of my hand.
the bleu cheese was good, but how can you screw that up?
they wanted to charge extra for grilled onions but raw onions were free.
i'm not exactly sure how that makes sense but, whatever.
the renovations are now impacting the quality of my ymca membership.
there is no classes between 12:30 and 4 pm?
what a joke!!!!!!!!!
i'm about to cancel my membership.
this is garbage
this place is so unorganized and slow.
where is management?
one cashier who was new that was on the register.
one person blowing up balloons....on a weekend.
it didn't matter that you ordered online.
the line for online orders was a 30 minute wait.
no not eat here....food is nasty.
my dog would not even eat this food.
also the service sucks.
waitress was all over her boyfriend and didn't even notice me half the time.
do not support places that use cheap food and expect you to overpay!!!!
bartender christopher is seriously the worst bartender ever.
sooooo in-attentive and rude.
my husband and i tried to order through the drive-thru.
the employee said "is that it?" after each item and was increasingly obnoxious.
yet another completely dissatisfied customer.
any other company besides budget!!
their customer service reps on the phone were terrible as well.
budget used to be a great car rental company...
but at some point they changed their policies and now they are just terrible.
i wouldn't if i were you.
the food is absolutely horrible and expensive.
bland, soggy crab puffs, the shrimp tempura had more tempura than shrimp.
i'm not sure it even had a 1/4 of a shrimp.
no rice served with the curry.
the best part of the meal was thr fortune cookie.
avoid at all cost!
i'm still in the store writing this review....
if that doesn't show how annoyed i am i don't know what will.
the guest behind me left, that's how long it too.
but i guess he doesn't understand what customer service is.
hope he has a gooooooooood hike.
not sure why the owner has lost interest but clearly he has lost touch.
bought a groupon then drove 25 min.
the outside looks shady anyways, avoid at all costs.
so she doesn't take groupon despite the groupon still being sold.
i told groupon to remove her as a merchant but she's still listed.
luckily i got a refund.
and that's if they have what you want!
service is so bad i'll be back next week
the food was serve yourself and was a bread and spaghetti sauce.
it is how you are representing your restaurant.
i will not be going back here.
we went with high hopes.
i we ended up leaving without even being able to try it.
i was told they would be at my house between 8 and noon.
when i hadn't heard anything at noon, i left.
they called about 3:30 to say they were on their way.
i wasted my morning.
if you need an estimate, take the day off.
i wish your follow up had been this good in the beginning.
thanks for the effort.
please please please don't get sucked into this company.
the leasing office is extremely unhelpful and have poor follow-up/communication with tenants.
the maintenance crew is quick but not all problems can be resolved.
these are unacceptable living standards.
i absolutely do not recommend anyone to move into these apartments.
i went to get a style and decided to get a dusting.
what a mistake.
the stylist hacked my hair.
i wrote a letter to the salon manager and i never heard back.
i ordered traditional mushroom chicken noodle.
will never come back again.
horrible horrible horrible customer service!!!
do not purchase from liftchair.com or liftchairexperts.com!!!
found this place on yelp with great expectations i would get my money's worth.
cassandra was not sure how to cut a pixie cut.
after being there for over 1hr i left very disappointed and dissatisfied.
back to the drawing board to look for a hair stylist.
why is it so difficult to find???
this is the old west.
we got robbed by morton's!
ordered some wings and a salad.
i called back and talked to the manager.
he told me i'd get a refund in 3 to 5 days.
service was slow compared to all the staff that i saw walking around.
it took at least 10 minuets just to have someone take our drink order.
when we finally got our food there was a hair in my sandwich.
management comped the sandwich but i won't be coming back here again.
um not quite!
there are so many real italian restaurants in the area that blow og away!
everything is so bland, over-salted, and well....
just not good!
prices seem so high for the quality of food.
the wedding soup should be ashamed of itself!!!!
we have been clients of their pharmacy for almost 2 years.
this was a smack in the face.
we ordered the same rolls we allways get cruch roll and  champ roll.
they should have honored the mistake they made and replaced the roll.
we will not be going back.
will not ever go back to this overpriced shabby bowling alley again!!
disgustingly rude staff who yells and instigates aggressive confrontation with customers
what i got was a lunch tray full of french fries...
we waited a really long time for our food...
everything was mediocre at best...
warning: it looks bad but tastes good...but it's not good.
whole family suffered stomachaches from the food.
something wasn't made right.
forget  this  brunch  on a special day.
mother's day was a disaster.
seated  in a  back patio,  so could have been  anywhere.
no view,  no music.
had  to ask for extra umbrella 3  times.
the food was  more than forgettable.
too many  other places  to choose  from.
hey sears you want to remain open start staffing appropriately
i'll probably never come back here again.
i had the taco trios and shared it with my son.
we had two chicken and one barbacoa.
all the meats were so dry it was hard to swallow.
i don't know how they could be serving this to customers.
i was greatly disappointed.
tonight was terrible!!!
i ordered my steak rare and it came out medium!
i was so hungry at this point i ate it to my un satisfaction!
never again will i go there for steak night!
you get what you pay for!
half price half the service!!!!
i miss the ihops in california...
it seems like every time we come here there's a line.
they lie about the wait just to keep you there.
i worked here and only lasted six weeks.
my lead supervisor was cold, indifferent and unfriendly towards me.
this adgitated her and she got an attitude with me.
this was an overall very disappointing and somewhat humiliating experience.
this is the no-fun corner alley.
yesterday my dog was dropped for wash and nail clippings.
we got him back with injury to his left front foot.
our dog can't walk.
he is 15 years old.
dog wash owner didn't do anything about it.
didn't wanted to explain what happen to him.
please take your pet else where even if cost more.
he is a butcher
they have young kids working the cash register with no customer service experience.
if i could give them 0 stars i would.
what a joke.
i'd rather pay the same amount but for 1 at starbucks.
avoid it at all costs!
the worst mexican food i've ever had.
the beans are the worst that i've ever had (you can taste the lard!).
ice man games.
terrible value on trad ins and on purchases.
sales staff is uninterested and rude.
just shop on line better value more selection.
shame - will not be recommending or returning here.
this time they make it in 10 minutes & demanded we leave.
don't run these wack specials with wack stipulations.
they tend to overbook patients.
i had to wait about 40-60 minutes every single time i went there.
you will wait 10 mins first to see a nurse.
your actual time with a doctor is about 10mins.
no wonder every one has to wait a long time.
i don't like a place that seems to be very profit driven.
waste of money.
the maze takes 10-15 mins max!
the laser maze is beyond lame.
huge waste of time and money!
update: just got my lab bill.
roughly 4 months later.
this incompetent medical practice pulled $1000 worth of blood work.
they should change their name to slowmed.
uneven and ugly.
i liked my therapist, and i enjoyed the therapy process.
however, they screwed up my billing.
do not go here.
they have zero customer service skills.
christopher should stop hugging the cocktail servers.
overall obviously poor management.
they have no clue about preparing an irish coffee.
now go to the kitchen and get me my whip cream.
profood is ok.
i like the side dishes.
conspoor service.
we had two bites of our meal before throwing it back in the box.
the quality of food is disgusting, as is the service.
don't do it...
i got a 3rd degree burn and no resolution.
i had the sweetest gal yelena...but i kept telling her the wax was hot!
she assured me i would be fine.
be very careful!!
maybe try another locale not this one.
so sad because i get waxes every 3 mos.
love me some mcdonald's on the way home from las vegas.
made it over there this morning just in the time for breakfast.
food was ok for the price but what got me were the untrained servers.
they really need proper sanitation training here.
fly also will stop on your table when you not pay attention.
they are thieves and i can understand why they have a 1.5 rating.
i'd give them no stars if i could.
hope the $100 you took from me was helpful to your crappy company...
not good in the neighborhood at this place!
with the restaurant half empty , were told we had a 15 minute wait.
will not waste my time going there....they obviously did not want our business!
not a good first impression attempting to dine at the bar.
they approved my loan.
i e-mailed them and called them numerous times they didn't return my calls.
they gave me a higher interest rate;  3.5% more than any credit union around.
i stopped by their branch.
the loan woman had no interest in giving a loam.
she asked me if i wanted to cancel which i answered yes.
what a waste of a trip to their branch.
turns out i was full.
so now i have a bottle of coolant sitting around.
oil change seemed ok thought, but i don't support dishonesty.
i went back the other morning and ordered an iced white chocolate mocha.
i just threw it away and went to starbucks.
who the heck writes a review for a frigging tunnel?
like really, do you need a hobby or something?
do not go here!
read other reviews from actual patients.
total cattle call.
no follow up and you cannot get carmen on the phone.
used to love going here, but the cleanliness of the place has greatly diminished.
also, my last sandwich has a "dirty rag" sour smell about it.
i'm assuming from the dirty knife used to cut it, but who knows.
obviously won't be going back.
i cannot recommend and will not be back.
went back today to try the lobster buffet and it was a big disappointment.
the lobster was over cooked and rubbery.
we will never be going into a jared again.
i bought the wrong ammunition my mistake.
i called to ask about an exchange .
took 3 times for the transferred call to go through .
we played 21 questions about the bullets, not upset about my error.
iam upset that i felt like they were messing with me .
my friend and i both got food poisoning from the schnitzel here.
had to got to the hospital and miss two days of work.
for the most part the office employees were friendly.
i was at this office for two hours, i will not be going back.
i am really tired of dr's overbooking, assuming your time is not valuable.
i should have read the reviews before booking with this dr's office.
this should be zero stars.
well the food was good until...
now my wife and i are disgusted with the whole place.
what a bad day.
wont cost you a thing.
knew there had to be a catch.
never again trusting this company.
oh well, my search continues.
it took 3 separate crews to get it working again.
the coffee maker, ironing board and toasters in both room were broken.
i tried to express my issues at checkout but it fell on deaf ears.
we love coming to our timeshare every year but this time we were disappointed.
.its been over a week..no word from anyone..your batting a 1000 midas
awful customer service.
don't bother stopping here.
staff are incredibly rude.
latte was weak and tasteless.
last week i stopped by and drove through the drivethru.
long lines.....for everything and not enough staff!
will never go again.
taco festival at our house next year!
you just lost my business, vegas beauty supply.
the servers here are good, but the food is awful.
the only thing that was good were the ribs.
soggy onion rings, weird sauces, burnt wings.
not coming again.
lame is all i have to say.
went on a friday night and only 5 dancers.
don't waste your cash here at all.
the only plus about this place is the guys are nice to talk too.
the very first time i was there was so great.
we had beer and wings....perfect....
fast forward to staff drama and cross contamination....
saw one pair of gloves....and zero hands washed....
when i asked about it, i got way too much attitude....
staff battles we're very uncomfortable.......
it was fun when the sisters we're there....they take time off...horror!
they rip you off on tuesdays.
any sub is supposed to be $6.49 but charge for bacon.
the cashier was the old man with earrings was extremely rude.
***i updated my review after having the nails for 1 week and 1 day.
from not pushing the cuticles back and chopping the skin my skin started peeling.
it's been 2 weeks now and it hasn't stopped.
definitely would not recommend due to the lazy work.
are these people trained to be jerks?!
don't waste your time unless you have plenty of time to waste.
took 50 minutes to get a chicken parm sub and wasn't even busy
seconds turned in to 15 minutes to put in our drink order.
we ordered the chicago omelette and the breakfast changa.
fast forward to that same evening...my stomach is a mess.
just wanted to get air in my tires.
normally someone would greet incoming customers but i guess thats not the case here.
this office is so unorganized and unprofessional.
i am very disappointed with my experience .
they had no idea how to help me with my tooth pain .
i do not recommend his place.

the front desk lady complained about this fact to everyone she talked to.
i stopped here for a drink after work....
i asked for a vodka neat, she put it on the rocks....
she than strained it and gave it to me chilled...
she was rude to me when i tried to ask for another drink.
there were 6 ppl including me in the bar, the only female.
i waited 10 minutes for a drink.
very not welcoming and unprofessional.
clams on half shell were ok.
entrees took 45 minutes and came out cold or luke warm at best.
had no flavor and over cooked.
had them redo the bill and would never go back.
food was not good but the service was worse.
save your time and money and go elsewhere.
today was an unnessarily horrible experience.

no 1.99 mimosas...although has 1.99 sign.
ordered mimosa and a hot coffee w baileys..
for a $7 mimosa & coffee drink?
i ordered there special southern quinoa special.
i was not really good.
not like what they have here which is not good at all..
god damn their burgers are dry.
their hot dogs and fries were just bland.
there are way better burgers and fries elsewhere in montreal.
walk to five guys on the same street.
it belongs on crescent street with the rest of the tourist trap places.
so my daughter, who is recovering from surgery placed the order online.
i will never go there again.
at least i have never had a problem with online ordering with them.
foul mouth hispanic worker on the phone that should be working.
this is the kind of person that can and will ruin your business.
i'll avoid this store from now on.
good food terrible service.
one of our guests didn't even get her entree.
we didn't get an app we ordered.
waited almost half an hour for the check.
no manager checked on us.
just awful service and no apology, explanation or even a free appetizer.
no customer should ever have to sit there while everyone else eats without food.
the customer service given from employee gwen was exceptional.
the customer service from the assistant manager philip was very unprofessional.
he seemed annoyed that he had to deal with my order.
not sure i will go back to this location.
and even more when i take my daughter out for a lunch.
and no surprise, my 6 year old daughter loses her mind as well.
serve them fast, so that we can get on with our day.
this is the worst korean bbq in las vegas.
the staff are rude and very stupid!
do not go to this place!!
they do not treat their customers right!
easily the worst doctor i've ever been to.
she doesn't listen and only pushes birth control on you.
the staff rarely answers the phone.
i had an issue last year and she was sent for an ultrasound.
now less than 6 months later the issue has returned.
i would not recommend this place for anyone.
i will never set foot in the place again.
store is not disability friendly.
computer techs are rude.
maybe it was because we didn't look like we have money.
how do they get 5 stars?
my fianc was disappointed as well.
the funkiest looking pad thai ever.
i went in for an x-ray at this facility and that went fine.
there was a wait but whatever...the real pain came after my appt.
it has been a joke.
i pay 100$+ for internet every month.
and this company just fails in every single way possible.
bad connection, bad service, bad maintenance, lazy technicians, terrible phone assistance, horrible auto pay.
they are even bad at taking your money correctly or easily.
i hate cox with everything inside of me.
and they have a basic monopoly on internet in phoenix.
please go out of business and die.
might have been the worst decision of our life.
honestly i wish we had checked the reviews here before renting the car.
that was fine because of the good price.
overall please do not rent a car from them.
ate there thursday afternoon.
hot wings sauce was mild, the last 2 oysters were bad.
when mentioned to the waitress she just said "oh".
won't be back ever.
have no intention of ever staying here again.
the re-loadable wristbands are a disaster.
we will not be back.
i am saying this because i went somewhere else and it uncompareable.
today is now sept 11, 2017 and still no call back.
i'm assuming this company is not interested in my business.
i will not be calling this company in the future.
nasty kimchee rice..
i asked for chicken and they gave me beef.
btw i am allergic.
never going there again
i was just in your arena, to see the new kids on the block.
i waa really looking forward to purchasing a shirt, after the show, but couldn't.
we ordered drinks, but my daughter wanted a 7up which never came.
apps came out with the dinners and the soups were cold.
i just got the feeling nobody really cared.
never going back.
a company's character is generally revealed via it's customer service or lack there of.
this place makes no attempt to hide who they are.
rude beyond belief.
look elsewhere for your shipping needs.
when did bowling become sooo expensive!????
nearly $8 / game per person plus $5 for shoe rental  - ridiculous!
i wish i had read more reviews before booking.
four in my name, four in my spouses name.
same days, same departure airport, same arrival airport.
internet is horrible.
i signed up for the midrange package.
go direct tv/at&t
purchased a $50 coupon for this restaurant for $20.
worth of food!!!
we lost $20 but will never go back!
stay away from igoopon.com
i have been consigning with closets on and off for five years.
why i go here, i don't know.
they are so rude and act like they're doing me a favor.
no longer will i give them my business.
this is not an isolated incident either; they've been rude to me before.
i've also discussed this with friends and hear the same thing.
catch ya later closets.
you're not the only game in town!
went here for lunch with my partner.
and were told booths are only for 4 or more guests.
there were 8+ booths available at the time.
we were seated at the bar which was uncomfortable so we walked out.
lost a sale and further business for the dumbest reason.
went there for lunch.
at first my families were really impressed with their sweet & sour pork.
so disappointed with this place, will not recommended to anyone.
i strongly agree with those who said mike was arrogant and rude.
it was a crazy and unprofessional interaction.
the restrooms resemble circa 1960 high school p.e. bathrooms and showers.
extremely slow and unprofessional.
i have literally been parked here for 25 minutes.
if i didn't have a broken leg i would go inside.
this is horrible
showed up at 9am on a tuesday.
there seemed to be enough waitstaff, but none of them were actually working.
i recommend skipping this restaurant
if i could give this pts a negative star rating i would.
also we were never informed if this charge until the bill came.
10 shots for $100 is ridiculous.
bunch of con artists at this bar.
no bedside manners and extremely dissatisfied for life with the services rendered.
we've called security several times, but it never seems to help.
aesthetically this place looks great.
the gym is great too, but the construction is horrible.
chilis must be doing very well to ba able to turn away customers.
this place was not busy either.
it's a shame too, i like the chilis in the edmonton airport.
paid $20 for a car wash that includes no interior service.
they didn't even get the bugs off my windshield.
wouldn't go there and waste my money again!!
edit: the business leaves me a message to contact them via email.
i did and never received a response...
classy crappy customer service to go along with their crappy car wash.
this place is a joke.
after 3+ hours waiting to see the dr, i had to leave.
i had no choice i had to get back to work.
not like she was greeting the next cusotmer with a hello or anything.
zero stars for stephanie and 4 stars for items in stock.
i had basically been overcharged, but they wanted me out of their way.
so i insisted it was wrong and showed them on the receipt.
i put one of the dollars into the tip jar.
she should be fired.
i would have given them a zero if i could have.
they literally treated me like i was a circus freak.
they would both stop working to get a close up look.
every technician came up to look at them.
i am not a showcase.
keep all documents and take pictures before and after your lease.
they make faulty charges and staff are very unhelpful.
take your business elsewhere.
horrible horrible service !!
the ladies were old and mean .
they were not helpful at all, very grumpy.
i have to ask them to bring out some accessories.
i'm trying to figure out if i'm qualified to apply for a particular course.
however, emails after emails directing me to different person and website.
my questions are not answered and i'm still clueless.
i'm not sure if this is the kind of college that i'm looking for.
went  in for  a oil change yesterday   my car wasn't leaking!
came out with my oil gasket  leaking!
toilets few and long walks in between.
come with a bucket for your youngster tp go in.
you can empty it in one of the fountains.
better yet stay away especially if you don't have a pre paid parking pass.
it will cost you much more than the festival is worth
this is the worst dry cleaner i have used in vegas.
service here is consistent, consistantly ignored and neglected that is.
leaving my empty glass to go eat across the street!
doesn't even deserve one star!
terrible food that we couldn't even finish.
bad service and way over priced!
save your $$ and appetite for another place.
they got theirs and still waiting.
very slow service
so you found yourself at ewing bros towing.
through no fault of your own, your car was towed to this place.
well, we are in the same boat now aren't we.
nothing to say just trying to delete a previous review.
heard to many bad things about the owner.
my boyfriend ordered general tsos chicken, which was good and good portion.
all in all, i'll go somewhere else for chinese food.
this is the worst place to rent a car.
i had left the visa card that i used to pre pay at home.
the representative was surly and could careless about leaving in the garage at 1am.
payless is trying to keep my money on this rental too.
they should be avoided.
bait and switch, hire and fire kind of company.
don't expect to keep a job if you get one at this location.
yet another business looking to undercut in every way possible.
decent place for a cup of coffee if you want to sell your soul.
this place is horrible.
the wait in line is fucking ridiculous.
as soon as i walked in, there was a funny smell.
i was so grossed out.
we couldn't stay.
we decided to just go to hodori.
horrible customer service.
if i could give zero stars i would.
there is also no such policy listed on the website.
in what world do you pay for a service before it is rendored.
this place pretty much sucks...
the only thing i enjoyed was my queso.
yesterday i had the pollo benidno (sp) dish and the presentation was awful.
it was a small piece of chicken that only took three bites.
for 9.99 a fish...i don't think it's worth it.
go to el camino in aurora!
what a waste of our time.
you couldn't pay me to shop there.
what a f***ing nightmare.
thats my review.
come on guys, we recently received a deliver menu for this location.
we called to place a take out order.
many items are no longer offered, no greek fries,  etc.
why send out a flyer that is not correct.
we will not be going back!
stay clear of this place.
i placed the order and even decided to upgrade to a premium bouquet.
he shows what kind of person tracy is in  his response.
they don't to back what they sell.
the sign says park ford do not buy from park ford.
i started a claim with the federal trade commission on this matter.
the salesman lied to me about this cars problems.
yikes, they are high!
but, here is the positive.
i went home and researched making hummas, then ordered the what i needed online.
note: it will store in the freezer for 6 to 8 months.
the store and the employees are just fine!
it's the prices!!
was not satisfied with my ice cream.
it is very overpriced and definitely not worth the stop.
it was well stocked i suppose.
people usually drop bottles, start fights or have dance offs on the corner.
the music is tacky and the prices are terrible.
unless some one else is paying for the drinks, ladies, enjoy.
otherwise this is just another mill bar.
this ruined my entire vegas trip.
after saying no, they kept making offers.
it was beyond stressful.
not to mention they kept us there for five hours.
i felt like a hostage being force fed their bs.
this caused the salesman to back off but his boss wouldn't leave us alone!
i wanted out and they kept hounding us!
we went for lunch and with tip and tax the bill came to $200.
the food was quite good.
the cost of the hot water was $1.75
didn't ask how i wanted my sideburns or if the length was okay.
seemed rushed given the line of customers.
didn't use a straight razor to clean up the neckline or anything.
won't be going here again.
felt very weird in the last sitting and won't be going back.
glad i could provide for the stealing jerk.
i don't recommend anyone to go to this restaurant.
the food was cold and it smells like poisoned food.
do not eat here!
it is disgusting!!
now we both have stomachaches.
undercooked pork chop?
solution = slice up and re-cook?
service not so good.
food not so good.
bill really not so good.
one and done.
for $64 for two of us, i expected a better selection and better food.
my wife and i went for dinner and we both were very disappointed.
we will avoid this place in the future.
they didn't take the wax paper off my cheese before they melted it.
i ended up chewing it before i noticed.
pulled the other half of my sandwich apart to find more.
even after pulling it out it all tasted like wax.
i didn't even a "oops sorry." i just threw it out.
added yelp just to write this review.
they deliver and that is the extant of the good points.
total waste of money and taste buds.
will never order from them again.
ordered from amazon and was promised the order in a month.
a month came and went no update no information.
tried to call the seller but no answer and the voicemail was full.
try to call the shipper and no one called me back.
very poor customer service
worst food it think i have ever eaten!
everything tasted like it was out of the microwave.
i ordered the ribeye and it definitely wasn't ribeye.
that's how our rib-eyes taste and that's what we get delivered to us.
they need new management!
what a joke this place is.
i can say that the place has a great atmosphere, that's about it!
beware the owner is rude and tries to intimidate you!
what a horrible experience!!!
this is not only a massage parlor but they also offer sex work!!!!!!!!
cannot believe this place is even open
ordered 4 hours prior and the food was not ready.
it took an additional 30 minutes.
no apologies given.
the funny thing is i was going to order sashimi...
first: who closes for lunch at 2 anymore?
it sushi not fine dining.
third: why would you turn away paying customers?
also carpet in a sushi restaurant is disgusting.
wtf is that crap?
can i give them minus stars.
no....well this is a poor pizza company.
so do they deliver in the time they say...no they don't.
they refused to fix it.
what kind of terrible business practice is this.
you have been warned to stay away !!
so disappointed  the orange chicken was chewy and the beef with broccoli was questionable.
shrimp fried rice was completely undercooked and inedible.
the only good thing was the wonton soup....
just wondering if/how/when can i get a refund on my $40.
where to start....first off, the drinks are overpriced and the staff is very unfriendly.
besides the atmosphere, the larger issue is the sound.
it would be manageable to see shows there if the sound wasn't terribly setup.
it's always way too bassy so you can't hear any of the other instruments.
helpfully it's the latter.
requested a quote from mark hamilton.
this was his email back to me.
i'm sorry but i work the field and the office as well.
it was very badly smelled, staff was very rude.
i have waited for 45 minutes, and guess what food is still not ready.
i lost $25.
what a rip off!!!!
had to ask manager and other servers for stuff, refills, condiments, silverware, etc.
we ordered tea, steak, and fries with our meals.
server didn't bring sugar, steaksauce, or ketchup.
didn't use the pepper because the top was nasty as well.
go to yard house nearby!!
clean and friendly place, it never disappoints!!
two people working, no one in line and completely ignored.
whole place was almost completely deserted.
my sister, brother and i were waiting in line completely ignored for 10 minutes!
employee was blatantly ignoring us.
we just walked away.
people who come with younger patrons spend money too!
was hoping for the time of my life...
ended up being a waste of time.
purchased a book from them via amazon.
bait and switch.
don't order from them.
empty wine glass and forgotten entree.
this place is an embarrassment.
this place is a joke.
take your money elsewhere.
huge turnover in office and they never care or follow up with anything.
in my opinion this is the worst ulta in town!
why you might ask?
and i would say...
i dont think i will ever come back to this ulta...
its and utter disappointment!
had a bad experience with the food.
place is nice, ok customer service but the food deserves an f.
tortillas were cold and overall no flavor.
this place has potential because is located inside a busy shopping center.
the guacamole was dark instead of fresh and green.
see the picture.
i will never come here again.
do not go here.
don't rent from payless!!
they will trick you into buying the additional insurance!
i've never felt so manipulated.
terrible customer service and like everyone else said unprofessional.
i like the pizza only reason why we keep giving them a chance.
no apologies and continued to say it's only 20 mins late!
not that great food.
the sturgeon i had was just blah.
the papaya salad was average.
the price of the farm raised (which i confirmed) sturgeon was $42.
the price of papaya salad $12.
i think the food is overrated and way overpriced.
i accidentally discovered on google it was rated 4.5. trust the yelp reviews.
customer service gets negative 10 stars.
the answer would of been fine without the attitude
if i could give 1/2 star, i would.
i drive out of my way to go to a different one now.
not what you expect from a professional business!
i have to find a better place...
they came today and did an awful job spraying.
called to make apt.
fucking pissed customer!
do we really need to use gutter language in ads today?
it cheapens the company.
horrible experience tonight!
we waited over 40 minutes for our food and the place wasn't even busy.
according to our server, this happens every monday.
the kitchen just seems to fall apart she says.
this place is poorly managed!
we will never be back again!
25 minutes to get four sodas delivered to our table after ordering.
food arrived 30 minutes after ordering.
some of it hot, some not so much.
stopped in while in the area.
our server was efficient but gruff - so we were ok with it.
alas, no buzz whatsoever.
i happened to be a chicken topped salad aficionado, it's my go to entree.
that's all i'm going to say.
oh - wait - the boneless buffalo chicken wings - very good.
there were no more than 5 parties in the entire restaurant!
worst nightclub ever.
they ruined my boyfriends birthday.
don't ever order bottle service there.
we spent 10 minutes there arguing with the manager because they're idiots.
we left because it was so much trouble.
i would have given 0 stars if that was an option.
never going back there.
they are also insanely expensive.
although they have a great selection of different breeds.
i would not recommend this place to anyone.
but as of late, they can't get a single damn order right.
she entered the room and went right to work, which felt very uncomfortable.
so i'm giving her a star for her time.
this was my worst experience dining in vegas.
will not eat at denny's again!
they need to close this restaurant.
rarement vu des vendeurs aussi impolis et inefficaces.
ils se cachent dans les rayons pour en faire le moins possible.
service client dsastreux!
the food was nothing like the banquet meals we were served for the conference.
the food was bland, tough, and boring.
the announcements and music are in spanish.
it's got bread--a pillowy pita."  i was served a cheap tortilla.
yuck yuck and more yuck.
watch out for cleaner hes a pervert.
also 2 guys that hang in arcade.obviously they didn't want me.
but my man yes.
big fat african guy and latino guy kept looking in our booth.
complained to management about cleaner.
they didn't seem to care.
gave him another 7 days and went in to see how much longer.
what a waste of time.
beware of this place.
if you use amex, they will want to take an imprint of your card.
if they don't want to take amex then why don't they say so?
because it might violate the terms of their lease?
going across the street to at and t!
food was okay.
not amazing but pretty good.
i will never go back to eggslut.
its not worth spending  hour waiting.
will i rent from ace again!
this attorney is the reason we lost the case!
her office was nice but she did not know what she was doing!!!
i do not recommend anyone hire this person.
she over bills and has her associates work on cases and double bills!
how does she have a license to practice law?
don't go here.
we threw it away and vowed to never come back.
my boyfriend spat on the ground as we left .
do not go you will waste an hour of pay .
wouldn't give my own dog this locations food.
this place absolutely sucks.
finally had to go out and yell at the workers.
they really didn't seem to care.
never coming here again.
not worth the price...
it's not what it use to be.
the ambiance, food quality is declining.
was a customer since it opened 16 years ago.
it's beginning to feel like the low end buffets in vegas.
i thought the pizza would save it, buy even that sucked.
i will never go back and regret not going to the rio.
the absolute worst.
long wait for 2nd shuttle, still waiting in line (45 minutes) shady location.
every single person in line is pissed.
check in takes 15 minutes each or more.
no upside, none whatsoever
really mango tango????
will definitely never set foot on your establishment.
they have compensated me for my gas given vip cards and everything!
i purchased a groupon and scheduled an appointment online.
the appointment was confirmed and i arrived 15 minutes early.
luckily, groupon is awesome and refunded me.
i am 100% positive i did not lose this myself.
i left without an expensive prescription from a specialized doctor that i needed.
i will never stay here again.
avoid avoid avoid!
i didn't like this burger at all.
this is an italian restaurant for tourists on a budget.
gloppy sauce, limited menu, and the rubbery meatballs tasted like horse meat.
cluttered, dusty decor.skip this!
should not even get one star!!!
don't bother calling, i held to dispute my bill for over an hour.
one word of advice, it's switch and bate on their website.
you'll be sorry you used them thinking your saving a dollar!!!
crumbs were everywhere.
dd needs to stick with donuts and coffee.
i'd stay away from this particular location.
this is the worst family attorney i have encountered.
they overcharge for josh aronson and samantha mendzel according to the state bar.
stay away from this office.
where do i start?
theres a reason why theres no line up at all for this place.
that's besides the point.
the food is mediocre.
calamari is basically frozen squid hoops that are deep fried.
onion soup was far too salty and pastas lacked sauce and flavour.
i needed to add a **** load of parmesan cheese to flavour it myself.
i wrote a 10% tip on the merchant copy but they deducted 15% instead!
folks , pls check on your transactions cos this is such an dishonest act.
may their god bless their restaurant.
ok guys, i am an indian and consider myself a connoissuer.
almost everything tastewise was awful, i am sorry to say.
a part of the package of my stay was tickets to a certain event.
needless to say it was not there.
if they promise you tickets or any packages to book with them.
also the hotel room i booked was not what they sold to me.
shady business, i go to vegas every labor day with a large group.
i ordered an item (pizza oven) to be delivered dec.
24th as a gift and it finally showed up  jan.
we ordered merchandise from walgreens!
was shipped by on trac!
was supposed to be delivered 6/13/16, by end of the day!
it was not delivered on the 13th!
i emailed on trac, on the monday evening!
received no response!
when package was delivered, part of content was damaged!
isn't that inferred?
common sense...no one just gets a bacon and cheese on a croissant.
is there no quality checks?
this is not the first time this has happened at this location.
when i first walked in it didn't give me any professional vibes.
that's not until a police officer stopped me to question me about it.
it's was just irritating because who wants to go through that.
for a vegas eatery, this place is only slightly better than fast food.
service is a joke.
drinks served in dirty glasses.
i expected a lot more from a place that carries guy's name.
he either doesn't monitor the standards of his namesake, or he just doesn't care.
laser wash more like craptastic dirty sulfur wash.
false advertising at best.
dr. leroy kareus was my initial doctor, but sadly he passed away.
in my own opinion, he was the 'gentle soul' of that practice.
das is the worst company that i have ever used.
our cars were simply "forgotten" to be assigned.
this was confirmed by a das employee.
do not use this company.
small restaurant, loved the decor but hated the food.
horrible, rude service!
i couldn't believe it.
if this place is dead on a friday evening, what can you expect?
ordered a ceasar.
it was just tomato juice with a tinsy bit of alcohol.
booasked for a food menu, they dont have one.
that was it.
we left for south of temperance.
best decision of the night!
broken tvs.  loud music.
not enough classes.
not for females.
been there twice to learn about their xbox and games.
this last time today it affected an important meeting for me.
he then took it somewhere and set it down.
not going back.
this place was so gross!
the best thing we tasted from here is the sierra mist soda.
huge disappointment & waste of money!
giving one star was being generous!!!!
can't review the beverages or food, we left.
ok food just very expensive .
$100 plus tip gets you two drinks, brussels spouts appetizer, flatbread and octopus plate.
basically 3 appitizers.
good but not that good.
it's a shame cause the food is great.
i really wish i could leave a positive review for this establishment.
i entered the bookstore in search of a gift for my partner's nephew.
during this entire trajectory, he never once asked me if i needed any help.
from the look on his face, he was viewing me with suspicion.
needless to say i will never go there again.
i have been here multiple times, the food was very good.
recently the quality has gone very bad.
chicken was smelling in briyani.
probablement le pire resto du quartier latin..
no big deal we can wait.
the food here is always okay.
it's usually pretty tasty, if you can get seated.
i've been here a few times and it never fails - the service sucks.
this time we didn't even stay.
my last two orders were wrong.
no resolution was given.
if i could give negative stars i would.
painted curb hmmm maybe or maybe not.
thanks for ruining my day for the second time scottsdale.
we typically sit at the bar and get good service however jenn h.
doesn't seem to know what good service is.
any who won't be taking my business there any longer and you shouldn't either.
and in case anyone wonders.
the drink was in her hand.
someone "accidentally " bumped into her.
i can leave it short - won't go again.
the food is good.
but the ordering process takes forever.
i was wondering why it took so long.
the manager guy was completely unprofessional.
the delivery driver was scheduled at 6 and still was not there at 9:30.
he was very aggressive and scared me.
i would not recommend andrews furniture in tempe.
ordered 3 meals for myself and wife and daughter.
they had chicken bowls.
they enjoyed theirs but my steak burrito was full of fat and grissle.
i will dispute my portion of the meal on my credit card.
never again !
called them and never received a call back.
went with another tree service that did a great job trimming my mesquite tree.
they had good reviews so i thought i'd try them out.
70 minutes for delivery when i was told 25-30 minutes over the phone?
well, the driver showed up 20 minutes later.
you can't be that busy on a monday evening.
i doubt i'll order delivery again.
totally unorganized, and inexperienced managers.
then when i get home my order was made and still incorrect!
this place is terrible.
they didnt let me in because of my shoes...
the guy at the after hours spot was an idiot too.
unprofessional jon b.
i went to get a unicorn frap and they were out.
order enough to meet your customers demands.
what a terrible way to run a business.
i am sooo disappointed!
only wed/thurs nights!
well, the place was dead....
what a huge mistake!
we go regularly and take friends.
we will find somewhere else to go for crab legs and fun.
it's the end of an era for our family.
this restaurant is unbelievable garbage!
will never enter again!
some seafood is not fresh, soup is too salty.
and the delivery is way too slow.
and no refund!
came in for the second time to bowl.
first time was great.
this happened about 5 times.
waiting more for them to fix the lane more time then we actually bowled.
i plan on getting a refund and never coming back.
every single time i come here it's always so slow!
the service is horrible!
there's only one girl i love but i never see her anymore!
if there was a -negative star i would use it.
unhappy servers who looked like androids from that movie zombies retuning from the dead!
took a break from studying college math to get a root beer float.
had to drive back for refund.
no offer of making for free considering high gas prices and 2 trips.
whip cream was nasty and no choc in chocolate shakes.
two thumbs down no sonic for me!
make sure you separate your stuff.
horrible service and the food came in very late.
i spent 20 years in korea, returning to the usa a few years ago.
i was really disappointed in this restaurant.
the lunch menu was served on a plastic tray with compartments, not korean style.
no banchan, no traditional accompaniments.
the american rice had no flavor and was mushy and warm.
the fried mandu was not crisp, but limp and dripping in oil.
avoid this restaurant.
go to hodori at dobson and southern instead.
wings are not eatable.
the pizza did not taste good at all!
i won't return and am ticked off at my loss of $20.00.
the service however, was great!
they are very unprofessional and i would not recommend this place to anyone.
this is just about the worst sushi place i have ever been.
the sushi was mediocre at best but honestly that wasn't the worst part.
the service was terrible.
it was all downhill from there.
needless to say we'll never come back.
unfortunately the rumor boutique hotel did not meet up to my expectations.
the renovation that had been done on the hotel was quite flimsy.
the sanitation standards were alarming.
lastly the customer service from the staff was not welcoming.
zero star unfortunately there is no option for zero star.
worst experience ever.
surprised with their most stubborn nature towards customer...
not willing to go there anymore even employer don't know what customer service is...
this was a terrible experience.
if it was possible to rate a negative zero i would.
arrived with a group of seven for breakfast.
how hard is it to put what the customer paid for in the bag????
and they never seem phased by the fact that they forget items.
i'm sending in a corporate complaint after this.
very snippy and snotty woman on the phone.
told they would take an hour to deliver.
when i asked her if people were there to hear she said no.
so i guess these were ghosts that were making loud background noises?
first of all, every negative review has been on point.
one day later, the ac stopped working again.
they told me someone would contact me today, however that hasn't happened yet.
i now have to put my tenants in a hotel for the weekend.
service is the pits.
get ready to settle in.
the tom yum chicken soup was delicious, but everything else was just okay.
other places do it just as well, in a timely manner.
never had such bad food in there
why would you get dim sum here when chinatown is right there?
also, why would they charge me 1 dollar for water?
no one knows.
don't come here.
went to my first fatburger and my last!
food was way over priced for a burger and some grezzy fries was $13.50.
i could have done better staying at home and eating out of a can!
one of my team members had his shoulder dislocated exiting the tunnel.
overall, highly disappointed with the way the situation was handled.
rude and stuck up staff.
food, alone won't make people come back if the service isn't there.
and i can't the staff was overly friendly at all.
so bottom line 1st and last time they will get my business
i am also disappointed, i ordered dinuguan not hardly meat in it.
the dessert ginataan bilo-bilo and fresh lumpia wasn't good i mean it was sour.
i could not return them because i ordered them to go.
i live about 25 mins away.
i tried calling several times but it was an answering machine.
i ended up buying panda  express for dinner.
i'll never going back there again.
one thing was good was the server was nice.
really wish i had have read these reviews before going.
please please please do not go to this place.
go to a playground and take advantage of your tax dollars.
don't feed this corporate monstrosity any more than it has been already.
what a horrible experience.
really mad at myself for going.
i have enjoyed this place in the past.
unfortunately on sunday i had a miserable experience.
i was told i would be contacted and never was - very poor service.
the staff were unprofessional, rude and were no help at all.
the place is messy and totally disorganized.
will never be back.
rude rude rude!!!
direct tv uses false advertising and immoral business practices!!!
this place is a shit hole.
there was probably 75 people in the entire place at this point.
i wouldn't recommend this place to anyone in their right mind.
nice environment but very poor service.
they closed the bar and restaurant early for unknown reasons.
front desk didn't know they were doing it.
meanwhile people sitting at all the tables with drinks.
forced to get room service and they don't serve alcohol after 11.
but worst of all was the attitude and lack of coordination by the staff.
do not order delivery here!
takes forever & the pizza got here not fully cooked!
sloppy doughy in the center.
pile of grease.
u just lost 4 costumers!
blamed it on the person who pick up the phone!
this was my favorite reggae spot up until last weekend.
my friends flew out of states to celebrate their birthday there.
we drove there around 1 am and they were closed.
i guess that's how they handle business.
i found this place through groupon.
never on time.
always forgot that i had appointments booked with them.
although i had paid for the services, i stopped going there for my treatment
after dr kareus left this place, it has gone to pure crap(sh*t).
the office manager amanda has no idea what she is doing.
i tell her that is the definition of insanity.
doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result.
do not ever come here for help or treatment in the medical field.
the worst run doctors office i have ever seen.
i see better management and workmanship at a mcdonalds or mexico.
do not go there if you don't want your clothes damaged!
worst cleaner i've been to.
terrible quality and even worse attitude!
the chips and salsa were good.
everything else was no bueno.
filibertos is much better than this sorry restaurant.
you'll either puke before digesting the food or have diarrhea after.
my wife and i had a much more negative experience last night.
had to ask for a separate glass with cubes.
another basic item missing is a pepper shaker on the table.
also lacking is a basic bread offering.
we found the wine list did not offer less expensive wines by the glass.
two glasses cost more then many entrees.
we will not be back.
when i went in, the gelato was sparse.
the story was the gelato maker quit without notice.
we'll never return.
hope they hire a gelato maker soon.
it was sad.
i suggested putting the another bowl on top but no.
dumb and extremely inconvenient for me right now.
grossly unprofessional outfit.
staff were unhelpful from the first call to until my appointment departure.
arrived and needed to do paperwork.
given an appointment time and told be here "sharp" ...
waited 45 minutes.
dismissive staff, terrible communication.
had to pay for parking to be dropped off!!
avoid if at all possible.
i came here on a couple of occasions: (1) ordered an arizona burrito to-go.
the burrito was just alright.
it wasn't anything to write home about.
again, way too expensive.
be prepared to pay an additional $0.50 if you're paying with credit card.
we kept calling the rest of the afternoon but never got an answer.
the hours on the door were 10-5 tuesday-saturday.
tried this place tonight, was a big let down.
nothing was good.
the noodles and the curry dish both just tasted spicy/hot, not flavourful.
the spring rolls tasted like any frozen grocery store product.
very disappointed, will not go back, and don't recommend.
2 - no, we will not perform marriage ceremonies between same-sex couples.
4 - no, we do not understand the paradox between #1 and #3.
she insisted on picking up the remaining food in order to get a refund.
won't be going back ever again.
ever since dr.  doyne  passed away this place as went to poop.
they dont listen to your needs.
which i found out by personally calling my quest.
the answering company answers the phone more than they do.
and no the answering gas service will not pass on the message.
i wouldn't recommend this place for my worst enemy.
it had went so far down hill that is not even funny.
additionally, they never responded to my request to contact me via their website.
my experience was with bill fitzpatrick.
he is absolutely unprofessional and discourteous.
absolutely horrible experience over this last holiday season.
i left with all the knots i came in with.
the massage therapist kept walking out of the room.
i gave her a good tip on the original amount because i felt bad.
the service didn't deserve a tip at all.
it wasn't even close to the full length of time, but whatever..
ask for mark the security guy!
this urgent care is the worst i have ever been to!!!!
i would never recommend this place to anyone.
if there was no star that's what i'll give them.
we had 4 people and they had a table for 6.
what a joke!!!!
we walked out and never went back again.
the owner should realize how crazy to do business that way.
do no go here, period!
holy cow has the fair gotten expensive.
i took three kids, my partner and of course me.
in total we spent over $400 because the rides were ridiculously expensive.
the coupon book is a joke.
i don't think i will go back.
it's a better deal to drive to cali for their amusement parks.
upkeep is kept to a minimum.
one bartender - no waitresses.
she's busy as hell and smiling.
phone rings and she's saying fuck, please don't be a delivery.
after reading all the rave reviews of this place we decided to try it!
i wonder why...?
will never go near that place again.
took photos for a visa application here.
2 photos for about $13.
$10 may only get me a slice of cake at their store.
sat for over 20 min with no drink order.
table next to us was waiting over 30 min.
we got up and left and went  to the burger bar.
had drink order within one minute of seating.
tom's urban needs more help.
the worst service.
however each time was we went the service and food were consistent.
the manager is extremely rude.
the food is really awful.
do yourself a favor and avoid this place at all costs.
shame on devin  luzod.
we will not be eating at marigold again.
lord help me.
every single employee i encountered in this store was rude.
they need to clean house in this ulta.
don't even get me started on corine, the cashier.
her attitude absolutely disgusted me.
my husband suggested this place ....
i will never return.
wouldn't go back to that location.
viande moyennement cuite, cadre vieillot et prix relativement cher pour ce que c'est...
faut vraiment avoir faim pour y aller !
long story short , i felt ripped off.
the review by mike w.
is very familiar to me.
i do not want to relive the experience emotionally so i'm keeping this short.
the food looks amazing, however we didn't get to try it.
that "someone" would be right with us....
we sat, we waited, server buzzed by once...twice...
no eye contact.
then we left.
as a dd perks member you earn points for purchases.
this is a very crappy rewards system!!!
decided to stop in after golf for some lunch and a little football.
it was a bad decision.
service is terrible.
it looks like they're short handed.
we won't do this again.
definitely not for us....fries and onion rings were greasy.
the onion rings were like the cheapest ones from the grocery store.
the hot dog was blackened.
absolutely forgettable, bordering on yucky.
in the end, it was just really poor quality food with poor preparation.
we will not be returning.
we came here only as last resort.
our experience really confirmed all the negative reviews online.
the food is mediocre at best, horrible service.
sorry i had high hopes..
still like joeys ny pizza, enzos, montasedos and buna gusto better!!
i tried just taste like cheap pizza..
worst pharmacy staff i've ever encountered.
transactional and not interested in healthcare.
there are 3 pharmacists that i've watched treat customers like second class citizens.
their organization is horrible.
took 55 minutes to reach the front of the line.
most of the workers lacked any enthusiasm or personality to return here.
i ordered the oven roasted foie gras.
this place is a complete rip off.
for $29, i received a tiny piece of meat the size of a thumb!
the meat wasn't even good.
if you're looking for a real dinner, look elsewhere.
the portions are ridiculously tiny and expensive.it's actually pretty insulting!
i wish i could give this place zero stars.
backstory, im a combat veteran, cancer survivor.
i was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer, so obviously unable to attend.
was led to believe i had cancelled my classes for the upcoming semester.
i never received any mail, emails or phone calls in regards to money owed.
my warning to all, get it in writting and expect nothing from them.
truly heartless and very disappointing...
unfortunately, my first (and what will be my only) experience with them was terrible.
i literally live right next door.
i'll be taking my business elsewhere for sure.
dont waste your time!!
chicken club pizza was bland and boring, fries and honey mustard were pretty good.
service was the worst part..
he tossed our pizza he was supposed to box up.
altanoor on this same street is way better.
the plate looks big but is mostly occupied with rice and lettuce.
nothing go great about this place.
decided to go here before the zumanity show and was extremely disappointed.
the margarita was extremely sour and distasteful.
the waitress had the margarita remade, however it was still horrible.
unfortunately i wouldn't go back.
boxed wine is better .
i would not recommend it.
my nail polish started chipping and coming off within a week.
when i do my own nail polish at home it lasts longer...
terrible service, terrible food, terrible prices.
don't waste your time, money, or energy on this location.
wayyyy over priced, tacky ambience.
i wanted to order take out.
they are usually closed at 11pm.
then they said they are closed.
i brought up the fact that they are closed at 11.
they said, they are closed for floor maintanence.
i have been a customer at this walgreens for over 15 years.
the quality of the staff has gone back and forth during that time.
but i had an experience this evening that needs to be recorded.
roxeanne was rude and condescending during my transaction.
i would not post a bad review under just any circumstances.
but, she was what i would call "flippant".
she was snotty and disrespectful.
worst ross ever!!
hard to find and it is always empty and never good finds.
after a few trips i will not going back to this one!!
pink twig assured me that they would be delivered before noon.
the flowers were not delivered before noon.
i take issue with the fact that none of this was communicated earlier.
a disappointing result on such an important day.
i would not count on pink twig for any important occasions.
eventually, after over an hour of waiting, we just ate inside.
good luck, won't be back, ever.
was headed to sky harbor airport.
didn't arrive in quoted time.
no follow up call received.
and they were already late!
canceled and scrambled to make other arrangements to avoid missing my flight.
not reliable and will never call on them again.
would give "0" stars, if i could (something i've never done in any review.)
terrible customer service.
the order was completed for 5 minutes before anyone handed it to her.
we were shorted french fries and a dressing for the side salad.
we won't be back.
what a terrible way for them to run a business!
slow service and way over-priced!
they lost my credit card.
i am not a local, this was a huge inconvenience!
high end restaurant, low end service and very poorly managed!!
will never darken the doors of a roy's restaurant again.
shame on you for a poor experience in every way!!
well followed the directions from the address took me to hot and juicy.
which sucked cause they had closed or i would have stayed to eat.
love hot and juicy but wanted to try something different really disappointed me!
this was probably the worst grocery experience of my life.
secondly, there was no fine steak available.
i don't need a filet mignon but a decent top sirloin would be great.
the fresh chicken options are one crappy brand or one even more crappy brand.
the wine was expensive - more expensive than harris teeter.
the staff was somewhat friendly so that's why i'm giving one star here.
staff seems confused.
several tables around us were complaining about the service.
if i could give this business a zero, i would.
i had extreme dizziness being on their program.
it was to the point that i could hardly go to work.
i saw two different doctors and they confirmed it was due to the program.
takes for forever!!!
do not go here, 30 minutes for breakfest sandwich, just go to a buffet
i loved los gamelos' tacos.
i ordered their steak taco and chicken taco.
no sour cream, cheese only if you ask for it...
will never step foot in there again.
not impressed at all.
popcorn is sold in plastic storage tubs and is expensive.
not even freshly popped on site!
way overpriced for subpar food.
came for the frog legs, someone failed to order the last shipment apparently.
my american burger was so salty i sent it back.
last time i had a grease burger that bad was at hardee's.
too lazy to put condiments on the tables?
typically you add those to your taste.
zero stars to management and the coo coos in the kitchen.
both derms suggested i increase the rx.
i wouldn't recommend spectrum to anyone.
never open when they say they are going to be.
done with the inconsistent times.
maria's fry bread it is.
they broke my furniture and overcharged me.
they are crooks.
i should have read these reviews before booking them.
los gemelos was our first stop on our first visit to madison.
here's how it went:drinks were ordered and brought, then the food ordering commenced.
it's say $5 cafe but there wasn't no $5 on the menu.
their food price shouldn't be the same with their customer service.
food is not fresh.
teryaki doesn't taste good at all there are far better restaurants in the area
the food was over priced and under cooked.
i will save you 150 dollars by saying do not eat here.
if i could i would do zero starts!
stingy with everything!
and they also forgot my quesadilla didn't even apologize!!
bait and switch.
but then they didn't show up when they said they would.
i paid them the quoted amount.
i will never use them again.
this sushi restaurant is sub par.
the rice in the sushi is not fresh.
i recommend sushi loca or sushi fever.
no tourist should stay here!
confirm this story at city tv montreal if you wish.
shape i asked for was square-oval  and that wasn't accomplished.
wont be returning
the animals are well taken care of.
wo fat was featured on dirty dining on ktnv.
i should have know because the food wasn't like it was before.
ordered a dvd from amazon with same day ship option.
and unfortunately for me, these guys were the carrier.
i am not sure what kind of monkey business these guys are running.
but amazon definitely should not be given their businesses to these guys.
oh, and ontrac should rename the business to "offtrack".
then this place is for you!
rudest people at any gas station anywhere.
i spend $600 - $700 a week in fuel.
never at another pdq
went back to get the sauce and realized i never got a receipt.
apologize, offer a free meal, say you'll make sure it doesn't happen.
anything other than the response you just gave.
will be calling corporate and not going back.
it's a shame because it's right around the corner from our house.
got the worst tattoo i have from here.
seriously the guy was on drugs or lies about having experience tattooing.
his name is emil.
i don't know why i even tried this place out, worst decision.
he needs fired, or needs to be an apprentice for a very long time.
don't go here, or at least don't get tattooed by him!
i'll attach a photo of mess he put on my arm.
i did get it covered up, so it's not there anymore thankfully.
shows they didn't care about my business!!!!
the wait here to pick up your car is ridiculous.
i've been here twice and both times it's taken forever to get a car.
i think over an hour the most recent time.
unexpectedly closed without reason, or not opened on time.
this place sucks.
worast services ever...
had to walk away after waiting for 20 mins and 2 complains.
talking to manager was nothing but useless...
they do not even care about customer review.
scammers to the t.
drinks were weak and food was not impressive.
13 minutes agothis gamestop is the worst!!
i'll never go in to that location again.
if i could give them 0 stars i would.
this place is not great, at all.
busy, but i don't get why it is.
service sucks, food sucks.
the bathroom was the messiest bathroom i have ever seen at any restaurant.
trash all over the place, napkins from the restaurant on the floor, no soap.
i won't be going back.
are you kidding me!!!???
every time i am here the service is so slow.
which doesn't really need restocking.
ummmm people have flights to catch and waiting 20 mins !!!!twenty!!!!
for a tea is ridiculous.
if i could give it zero stars i would.
update: never got to order because the airline called my name to board.
i've been meaning to write a review about my experience at the salon.
unfortunately, i'm very very disappointed.
and still with makeup you can see the mess.
very, very disappointed.
will never go back.
last weekend ordered some takeout for my band and i and it was terrible.
what happened you used to have good potstickers.
worst chinese food i have ever eaten.
this place is dirty and the food was bland.
they served basamati rice instead of regular rice.
i would never eat here again.
i don't know if chili's has gone down hill or just this location.
we were excited to go, but were pretty disappointed in the food.
their queso looks and tastes disgusting.
they put re-fried beans in it, yuck.
their fajitas came with a weird not traditional side display.
i just don't know how you can mess up queso and fajitas.
the service was great, but the kitchen/menu isn't.
one star doesn't even do these people justice.
it's been going on 6 months now.
do not do business with this company.
horrendous place to go too!!
probably not even real doctors.
takeout order through just eat.
arrived on time, everything i ordered was there (two common complaints about this restaurant).
what is going on in your kitchen!?
at least i have spring rolls...
i really want to give this restaurant no star.
huge disappointment on all the dishes.
the handmade noodles were too thick.
also had the special lamb fried rice and it was super salty.
can't even take a second bite at it.
we end up didn't finish any of the food and left.
it was unfortunate because all those foods went to waste.
don't recommend this restaurant to anyone !
nice atmosphere but the owner is seriously rude to customers.
pastries are not baked daily, look one week old.
they serve no frills quality starbucks coffee.
don't waste your money in poor quality and customer service.
bad experience with a female dentist there.
the female doctor there is lazy.
i got charged "full price", $$$$$ for adult root canal.
afterwards, she send me home without antibiotics nor pain meds on my infected tooth.
it was so painful that the horrible pain kept me up all night.
i would not recommend her to anybody!
where to begin?
slow service on a night where there was not many people in the place.
more like a medium.
the worst customer service there is.
they have a nasty attitude and lie.
instead of saying oh ma'am i apologize.
and he again told me that it was my fault not his fault.
no comparison to the cracked egg which is right down the street.
food is bland!
nothing special about this place at all!
i wish i could give this dental practice zero stars.
very sarcastic also, in an failing attempt to be funny.
then finally they did and mailed my mom her check.
then going to cobblestone for about 15 years...
stopped by for a quick bite in between commitments...
sat in the drive thru for almost half an hour!
always get a second opinion.
gave my family food poisoning on 5/29, so officially no reason to go back.
service was always poor when i'd go in the late evenings.
the guys seemed like they'd rather be anywhere else.
it was convenient to have a mexican place near me.
unfortunately there are no roberto's around here.
we went there to try all you can eat pasta for $6.99.
what's worse,  they messed up my wife's order...
when i got my dinner,  i ordered garlic and oil sauce.
there was only one problem,  no garlic and all oil.
we'll never go back there again!
do not rent from this company!!!
how this place gets 4 stars is beyond me.
so, just updating this review.
the drive through line is always wrapped around the building.
the line inside moves at a glacial pace.
i have to confirm 3 times and they still don't get it right.
seriously, wth are you guys doing in there.
awful customer service.
bought furniture which was severely damaged.
been getting the run around for 3 days.
no return phone calls as promised.
still no satisfaction.
i would highly suggest staying away from this store.
i would not buy furniture from them!
i was so excited to play it.
won't recommend this place to locals or visiting friends & family of mine ever!
like i said....pinball hall of laaaaaame!
do not buy from this guys!
why them and not us?
we got there earlier than the other party!!!!
maybe next time.
i have never in my life been left feeling more ripped off.
i ordered a chicken quesodilla (7.99) and after adding chicken, got charged 12.40.
from the other reviews, it seems that this is standard practice.
beware of having automotive window tint film installed by huff european automotive.
will never come back to this place.
i booked my appointment 1 month in advance.
was just there on friday night.
gave the bartender a cash tip and left no tip on the credit card.
just looked at my statement and now i got charged $18.50.
tried calling the bar three times but nobody answers.
if you use a card here, make sure to check your statement afterwards.
ordered a 20ft sliding glass door.
after signing the paperwork i was informed they don't take debit cards.
sound like they have some real money issues beware.
will not ever go back there.
my first experience at canyon 49.
their menus is very small.
i ordered a ny strip medium rare but it came out well done.
and the steak was so small, it was a waste of $21.
the outside of the steak did not look nicely charred either.
the shrimp cocktail was a let down.
both food presentations looked like they barely even tried.
other than the food, the waitress was nice.
the noodle and the chicken was partly cold.
and the bum is partly hard partly soft.
it looks like it's brought from a chinese's market and microwaved it.
it is unacceptably.
and they even include tips already.
unfortunately, i couldn't be more incorrect.
i ordered the red chili burrito, which according to yelp, is a regular favorite.
the red chili had an almost expired taste to it.
the portion was incredible small.
but dinner last week was foul.
the service was disappointing and the food, especially the seafood soup(???) was absolutely inedible.
we spent $150 for 3 people and hated everything.
never going back.
this company is a joke, after two months after my order.
i still have yet to have my oder fixed by this jerks.
they choose not to show interest is helping me.
good prices but this please is honestly not worth the hassle.
first of all you have to leave your purse at the counter.
i am not comfortable doing that anywhere.
who does that?
the only place i have ever seen this before was asu's bookstore.
then you walk in this warehouse that has no air conditioning!!!
do not rent here!
the best thing about il mulino was the anticipation.
don't be fooled fellow yelpers.
if you're not open 10am-midnight saturday-sunday....
don't have that show on yelp and your website.
awful customer service and i don't recommend to anyone.
here's to you.)if you're still interested, try the tater tots.
they're actually pretty good.
but don't even bother getting a drink upstairs...
if you haven't noticed yet.
the service sucks.
worst, i wouldn't even say service because there wasn't any.
so disappointed in the "service"
my husband ordered a beer and he never got it.
the waitresses disappeared on him a few times.
my husband ordered wings and he said it just tasted like chicken.
don't rent from these people.
march can not come soon enough.
they are the worst company in terms of customer service.
my recommendation is to run from this company as fast as you can.
then he gave me my juice.
complete waste of my time!
if possible i would give this place 0 out of 5 stars.
it was well operated in the early 2010's.
now it has gone completely down hill.
the prices of drinks are outrageous and the food quality is sub par.
avoid this place at all costs.
the good news is there are 4 quality bars & restaurants next door.
nothing says fashion trendsetters like $4 pencils and $10 decks of playing cards.
kinda embarrassed about it, but it has made for great fun at the bars.
$40 for a coffee mug.
i can play dramatic.
only in america!
we did a walk in.
been here several times before with ok service.
it's been 3 hours now and still 2 people ahead of us.
i had purchased a deal saver for 3 blowouts.
not the best experience but figured maybe they were working out the kinks.
i tried to schedule another blowout right before the holidays with no success.
it turns out they only have 1 stylist that does blowouts.
i'll continue to stick with the other blowout businesses in town.
i had a horrible experience with dr gross.
bad medical care, nasty, angry man and mean office workers.....that's all i got here.
i would never recommend him and i hope others stay away.
horrible costumer service!
worst airline ever!!!!!
do not fly this airline!!!!!
zero % on time!!!
flights usually cancelled!!
consider yourself warned!!!!!
not even worthy of zero stars!!
run fast from this company.
miscommunication from the beginning, misled, and lied to.
if that's what you want, then go for it.
not one thing went right.
melanie was the shining star, otherwise this rating would be zero stars.
not sure how they are in business.
after a few good experiences, it went bad vey fast.
she will go fix her daughters snacks and also consider it studio time.
my daughters 1/2 birthday shoot was themed in purple to match her party.
so an $80 outfit and a $25 headpiece were deemed useless at that point.
think long and hard before doing business with this lady
this place really sucks.
we have been there several times with our grandkids because they like it.
food has been terrible several times had to return to get the hamburger corrected.
just a bad place to eat.
maybe other steak and shakes are better.
don't know how this place stays open.
the shaved ice has no taste , just a plain ice...
i think he should have hired a gm.
what a mess.
food is back to the old crap.
what a waste of time for resturant impossible.
the should have listened.
sell the place.
i got a full set with color changing powder and a pedicure.
i spent $100 for the service and i now have 4 nails still on!
only 4 days after going here my nails starting breaking off!
im highly upset for trying a new spot to be this disappointed!
i will never go to this place ever again!
still the worst shopping experience ever.
in the mall due to christmas shopping and decided to stop by.
so i went and spent money at chanel.
then i gave them one more chance same week barely anyone there.
went up to the register to ask for my item.
these people really are that bad.
three of us went to brunch yesterday.
two of us ordered the edamame hummus breakfast.
both of us were feeling unwell by yesterday afternoon.
co-incidence that the two of us who ordered the same item both got sick?
make your own determination, i guess.
rudest place i've ever been to order food.
don't go if you're a woman, seriously.
just badly treated!
poor customer service.
lady in home section with medium blonde hair didn't say anything.
store was messy.
won't go back.
linda's customer service absolutely sucked tonight!!!
why is that???
that's not okay linda.
i have my receipts.
they have typical trucker showers...
small skinny sandwiches with high price-tried it once never again.
and openning up across from subway wasn't to smart.
if i could rate this bank zero stars i would.
the lines are always out of control with at most 2 tellers working.
this place is absolutely terrible.
do not waste your money.
i couldn't even eat it.
just threw it in the garbage where it belongs.
this is honestly the worst sushi place ever!
i found hair in my sushi and i was so disgusted!
also, the service was so bad and really slow.
i don't recommend anyone to go to this restaraunt it's the worst!
google gave good reviews of this place but i don't see the appeal.
the food is okay.
i have had better hakka style food near airport road.
and the beef schezwan was very syrupy.
we ordered the family dinner special and an order of crab puffs at 7:13pm.
we never got our crab puffs.
i highly discourage anyone from ordering delivery from this place.
don't waste your time.
oh and with my loan approved!!!
i will tell friends and family about this bad experience.
the customer service at this location is the worst i have ever experienced.
i will not be returning to this store.
and quite frankly i believe the quality of lv is going down.
with service like this- nothing will change until their sales drop.
it's unfortunate that an icon like lv has to go to such a low.
avoid this place at all costs.
i got violently ill from one of their cakes (rancid custard).
they refused, and basically told me that it wasn't their fault.
poor customer service and rancid goods.
not a good combination - purchase at your own risk.
horrible prices for low quality food .
i will not not go here  anymore !
ordered the jungle "curry" and got a weird tasting soup.
so disappointed with our food.
i actually yelped this place before i ordered.
doesn't even deserve one star.
my sister had genetic testing and found out she had lynch syndrome.
at that point, if i had been dressed i would have walked right out.
i wrote a previous review that was filtered, ha, ha.
the truth is not pretty.
i now question all of yelps so called reviews,
i also felt the customer service was poor here.
horrible customer service.
did not appreciate him being a rude wiseass.
absolutely terrible food and service.
25 minutes to cook a burger that was given to me cold.
onion rings were nasty, which i didn't order, never got my drink.
would be hard to feed that to my dog.
made a appointment with eric to come do some work at my home.
i will be sure to never recommend them.
got management response.
food came out as these folks are trained.
wait until i get a chance to speak with them face to face.
my guess is we are not the first family to experience this.
phone service is absolutely horrible.
learn how to train your employees for phone conversations.
very unhappy with ping golf at this moment...
two other clubs have loose weights and are about to lose those too!
this would leave me with no clubs for a month of the golf season!
not taking care of the customer in my opinion!
but with the new car wash manager, the quality of everything sucks.
so sad because the people that have been here for awhile are great.
another 10 mins.
this place sucks bad
first guy that came out was nice, after that it was all downhill.
their communication was extremely rude..
it was the most ridiculous, unprofessional, incompetent pharmacy team i've ever encountered.
will never go to this walgreens ever again.
being too busy is no excuse.
walgreens, it is criminal to treat hospitalized, sick persons as your team did me.
staircase has bags of garbage.
overflowing with rubbish.....
terrible service and food.
the food was decent, and the atmosphere was ok.
but the issue was that the waitress charged us for our daughters kids meal!
and we never received her dessert either!
with the way we were treated, we will never come back again!!!!!!
service is horrible here.
and the food is the same.
ordered steak bowl and the steak was tasteless, and burnt.
saved your money and go elsewhere.
could not get ahold of them at all.
had an emergency with out water heater and the line just rang and rang.
won't be returning, though the service was ok.
if you want one star service for your pet, then this is the place!
you'd be better off finding a free clinic.
had the huevos benedict and they were awful.
waited twenty minutes for the waitress to even take our order.
mind you she was delightful afterwards, which i'm thankful for.
come here to drink and people watch.
go to denny's for a better meal.
oh and the hashed browns have no potato...
they are all cheese.
worst service, worst dessert !!!
fake he server service is bad !!!
i won't be returning unfortunately!!!
so don't treat your customer with this kinds of food and service !!!
they denied helping me because i was born a man....
what in the actual fuck.
sundays are women and trans only.
get the hell outa here with your sexist bullshit.
the girls that work there are rude and clothes are not on time.
talking about a professional!!!!
the food really isn't that bad.
it's the rude people that work there.
just call and see.
nothing else to it.
she acts like it's an inconvenience when you call her to place an order.
it's really just bad customer service that makes this a terrible place.
to steve f....sounds like using him could have been a huge mistake.
i never received an estimate.
decent food but terrible service.
if they continue this way they'll be closed within the year.
tacos were good and priced well.
drinks were over priced and just average margaritas with fancy names.
two hour wait on a saturday was to be expected.
i got the pad thai, and it was terrible.
the chicken was deep fried, and 90% fat.
i can safely say that giant eagle's pad thai is eons better.
the vegetables were mush, and the fried rice was burned to a crisp.
one star is generous for this place.
i'm a local.
the food was good but the service was horrible!
first the frozen machines wasn't on so we couldn't get anything frozen.
she was rude and horrible!
never have we had a problem with the service until tonight.
then when they finally decided to answer the phone.
it was like a child was taking my order absolute complete silence.
finally my co workers/roomies arrived and i was aloud up to my room.
probably the worst hotel we have ever been at.
the pictures are deceiving, and the the room quality is no were near amazing!
but the staff was more than accommodating, even though the hotel is crap!
we will probably not be staying here ever again!!!
they close at 11pm.
i was told yes.
will not return.
bought a vegan cake for my sons birthday.
asked if they could write happy birthday on it.
woman tells me can't i'm not a cake decorator.
this store gives zero shits about the customer experience.
for a $36/person meal, i expected better.
crab still had ice in it and was bath in salt.
kobe rib-eye steak was tough, everything else was just ok.
only good thing  was the lamb.
not much selected in the dessert menu.
i've gotten sick twice now after eating here.
had a terrible experience here.
they forgot half the orders at our table and we waited for 40 minutes.
oh, and the italian calzone was terrible with hardly any meat and all peppers.
i always feel defeated when i leave the dmv.
found out it even worse than i thought, zero service.
guess what's more ridiculous?
ten pieces of tiny bone in pork ribs charges $10.
avoid this place unless there is the only one restaurant in this planet earth.
i am an amazon prime customer that has had multiple packages "delivered" by ontrac.
they never seem to be able to pick up the customer service calls.
truly horrible service!
if you have not delivered the item do not mark the status "delivered"!
if you can not find the location contact the addresee with the information provided!
this review is not specific to this panda store.
it is panda in general.
it is at least a quarter less.
we are going to be done getting panda take out.
i cannot have food leaked all over in my car.
wow been in lime for over 10 minutes.
i was looking for a keyboard when the power went out.
no thanks guys.
i watched them kick people out and block the entrances.
there's gotta be a better way to handle situations like this.
never coming back to this location
not so honest or reliable.
the police were actually trying to help these people steal my house!
this is only a smidgen of what i/we have dealt with since moving here.
the phoenix police are domestic terrorists with no accountability.
i've tried getting assistance, no one cares!
do not trust this police department.
how about you calling corporate instead of dishonoring a coupon issued by your corporation?
i won't make that mistake again.
maybe then they won't tell you to "call corporate" next time.
you can't really be serious?
look the proof is in the pudding ...
im guessing no!.
i could go on and on about this but to what avail.
food is generally bad.
no seasoning on the steaks--even when i ask for extra.
waitstaff is slow and inattentive.
server rude blonde.
tried to enjoy my saturday off with a beer and a salad....no bueno!!!
that is how bad the service was.
asked for the manager was told...we dont know where he is.
great idea, horrible follow through.
hire new staff and manager...now!!!
im too tired to even call the manager again.
go down the street to pei wei (sunset and stephanie)-  you're welcome!
he was so rude and interrupted me on more that one occasion.
i hung up the phone feeling so angry.
never going back
if i can, i really want to give zero star.
the food completely do not have any flavor except spicy and oil.
i waste my money and i have to search another restaurant.
what's the point of paying for amazon prime if it's delivered by this company?
it stated delivery attempted while i didn't hear a peep on my door.
calling their customer service is a waste of time since nobody ever picks up.
hollywood men in california was a million times better.
would not waste my money to ever see show again.
dancing was mediocre, staff was rude....blah!!!!!
picked up a cake and some macarons for an engagement party.
it's mediocre quality at above average prices.
if you want a pretty cake, this is not the place.
there are other places that charge less, decorate much better, and package with care.
worst course experience.this course overbooks every day.
waiting upon waiting.
when calling the clubhouse, the phone just rang.
i do not recommend this course at all.
spent 110 dollars on a pair of jeans that are supposedly "madewell" youd think!!
nope they ripped in the butt 4 months after having them.
store refused a refund or even a new pair.
best they could offer was 20% off a new pair.
not spending 90 dollars on another pair to have them rip again thanks though!!
then alberta gaming fined them $2000, lol, that will teach them.
this place has gone to hell!
i just paid $12.00 for a plate of fat and grissle, smothered in cheese.
they call this carne azteca.
not the first meal i've complained about either.
ever since martin left, this place is mediocre at best.
we used to love their food.
now we're just happy if its edible!
we'll just smother it in queso, and they'll love it.
get your shit together, and have some pride in your work.
this bk stinks like throw up and shit.
their burgers were bland and not so tasty at all.
this was my first time to any red robin.
started with great service, great food.
then our waitress finished her shift, said someone would be replacing her.
she left, we pressed a button for service since no one came by.
it timed out twice so i asked the hostess to send someone over.
the manager came by, got us more fries and drinks, but no new server.
makes me sad because the food was good.
i'll never know if the dessert was as well.
horrible experience, in may there is nothing to see...
the bars were closed...
i felt like they stole my money...
keep in mind both times i've gone has been before 1pm.
they need to stock up better
great furniture but absolutely horrid customer service.
bought a living room set there.
first wrong delivery address then attempted delivery way outside the delivery window.
every time i call i'm on hold forever with their contact center.
dont go here.
if i could leave 0 stars, i would!!
i will never go back!!!
not so good.
given we had a large group (more than six) it was a fixed menu.
the vegetables (beets and carrots) appeared to be canned or pre-frozen.
way too much couscous for the sauce and topping.
not worth the $50 per person.
i'd pass on this restaurant.
terrible customer service.
now i know why everyone told me not to go there.
we will never go to this location again.
btw....77th and bell helped us out and we walked out with 2 new phones.
once again...they get our business.
probably the worst pharmacy a cvs has.
sat in the outside lane for 20 minutes only to not be acknowledged.
don't get here often, first time was great!
staff even separated the shrimps due to an allergy.
next visit, repeat the glass noodle salads, yuk!!!
it was wrong,clumpy, too hot heat wise.
called to discuss the experience, person didn 't care much.
asked over  the phone for a manger, no straight answer, or not avaiable.
regret refering people.
party trays, only the manager can quote, not around  so never ordered.
service matters, i wanted 0 stars.lots of good options elsewhere...
the price always changes when you return a car.
they will also break contract and charge more than what you agree to pay.
i will never rent from enterprise again.
worst location ever!
they all have their heads up their damn, mother fucking asses!!!
thet messed up my entire order!
them fucking assholes!!!
we will never go back there again.
you killed it - ohhh nooo!!!
no communication skills at all.
i bought a wayne dalton door in 2012.
the door was a 9100 series 16x 7.
the cracked in the middle and the company would not stand by their product.
lousy company and poor product.
worst chinese place ever.
unseasoned ground beef and no toppings?
worst $10 i've ever spent
the food from this location has made me ill on more than one occasion.
i don't think i will take my chances with boston pizza anymore.
the restaurant is newer and well kept...
but doesn't redeem itself from the lousy, often undercooked food.
save yourself from getting food poisoning and go somewhere else!
bad service, servers have horrible listening skills, food is not good.
the manager or owner does not exist.
please avoid this horrible restaurant.
had to go to avets.
even pa code states 1 or 3 year vaccines.
this leads me to think that they are knowingly over-vaccinating animals to make money!
i think any restaurant that disrespects a customer deserves a one.
a long wait ensues - about 15 mins - no soup, no take out.
our order gets called, so i come up to the counter.
i point out that we did order the soup for dine-in.
the woman nods then says...
whatever..." she proceeds to call out the next take out order.
i am really disappointed in this place.
the food had no flavor and the people working there all hated their lives.
i will never return here for the over priced slop they serve
this subway always is lacking.
i only go cuz it's near my work and it's easy.
today they had a sign up advertising their soup, but no soup available.
out of cookies...out of oil!
all at 11:30 am!
before lunch rush even!!
i ordered the carne asada fries...
the fries were fried last month and the rest was cold...
don't waste your money drive 5 more min and go to filibertos.
sad but true
200 dollars for a very mediocre job.
they didn't have time to do my appliances as promised.
they did an excellent job on my floors i will admit.
i've had much better cleaning service for much more reasonable prices.
ordered pizza through the app papa kelsey's offers.
applied a coupon that was available and placed my order.
the app states if you have any issues call the store.
absolutely terrible service, and by far the worst massage of my life.
the masseuses lacked interest and barely worked on us.
that's 20 minutes of massage time we missed out on because they didn't care.
it was absolutely terrible, do not go!!!
i love thai but this was not up to par.
i ordered shrimp wonton soup and it was chicken.
i also ordered maximum spicy and the was no heat.
if i wasn't feeling under the weather i probably would have complained.
oh well, i just won't go back.
what happened to you red tree?
won't be going back....
food selection: very poor for $30+ buffet for each person.
which i find it totally diswelcoming.
this is by far my worse experience in any buffet.
today i placed an order at 5pm?
by 7pm it hadn't even been processed.
going in there is just as bad because everyone on the floor ignores you.
there is nothing "best" about this place.
this dentist is a crook.
she insisted on working on a tooth that was not bothering my husband.
we never went back.
a year later we got an insurance statement where she billed for 2 crowns.
he never had them.
we are suing her, along with our insurance company for fraud.
don't risk it!
they have also messed up our order more than once.
we will be taking our service elsewhere and will be contacting corporate.
got a tix4tonight coupon and went here at 9pm after a show.
the food was horrible and the couple next to us agreed.
all in all, it was overpriced and not good.
standard drinks tasted terrible.
bartender and manager fought with us about ordering "well" liquor.
we were never given an option.
would have happily  paid more for a drink that didn't taste awful.
they wouldn't even taste what they made.
biggest waste of money.
sonic is not what it used to be.
the food was awful.
the only thing i can say i like about this place is the drinks.
but i guess that's why the call it a drink stop.
food was cold, didn't get sides until we were finished with our food.
server never checked on us.
we have been to a lot better fox and the hounds!!!
the waitresses were really rude and barely refilled our drinks.
quite unbelieveable the conversation was going on.
i e-mailed corporate office and got an immediate response.
apparently this location is a franchise but they said they'd pass the complaint on.
my daughter has long, poker straight hair half way down her back.
she went in to have 2 inches cut off.
she doesn't have it tapered, just straight across.
isn't cutting hair straight about the simplest thing you can do?
how could they not notice?
or didn't they care.
didn't even apologize.
i do not think i ever had such bad experience with any food place.
ordered the "tasting menu" with a glass of wine.
the tasting menu consisted of some juvenile experiments with some-what rotten products.
there was a cockroach in my food.
shocked and didn't know what to do, i told my waiter.
he simply apologized and gave me new food.
disgusted i couldn't eat it and they still made me pay for it.
it was terrifying and i will not be returning anytime soon.
i am not sure if we have ever had such mediocre food .
do not get me started on the sides ..
this meal made me reconsider why i enjoy eating at all .
i suggest mastros city hall , cafe monarch and cowboy ciao .
i ordered a fettuccine alfredo with a broccoli cheese soup.
fettuccine alfredo was spoiled along with broccoli cheese soup.
the pasta had the worst smell you can imagine.
it smelled so bad.
the broccoli cheese soup was a weird goop color and texture.
we arrived looking forward to a great vegetarian buffet and we're really disappointed.
what was left in the steam table trays was cold and picked over.
place is hit andmiss.
thanks dunkin donuts for annoying us this morning.
on 9/9 i stopped in the office to inquire about renting a 2 bedroom.
as i'm sitting there waiting to be assisted, a male resident walks in.
the man behind the desk ask him, how he could help him.
the resident ask about pest control because he has an infestation of roaches.
needless to say, once i heard that i immediately headed for the exit!!
was there and the food was average.
the manager asked him to leave......the nerve.
they always get my order wrong always!!!!
absolutely terrible i worked at arby's i know what it entails this is unacceptable
if i could give this place zero stars, i would.
this is the second restaurant that has been closed when they are reportedly open.
poor customer service at the get-go.
can't even get in to make an order
having a lot of trouble getting dresses that are paid for.
getting the run around from staff.
dresses ordered months ago, no calls.
worst service available even for an airport location.
restaurant is not clean and all around terrible service.
i'm fairly certain not many people that need mmt read reviews on yelp.
they're machines are rigged.
the 3 times i max bet the machine freezes and takes my money.
they are scam artist and you can't trust the attendants or casino
worst service ever.
we were invisible to the staff in a store with no customers.
my son and i were shopping  for a simple weight bench, bar and weights.
1st visit was really great  ayce but.........
horrible urgent care, will never go back.
dr couldn't care less about his patients.
so, we were told the calamari is very fresh and has great flavor.
it did taste very good and we were excited for our dinner.
my wife got the kailua pig as it was also recommended.
unfortunately, it was horrible!!!
the pork came with beans and they were way too salty.
we also ordered the caesar salad and it was doused with dressing.
had to ask for a replacement with dressing on the side.
this place was a disappointment and way overpriced!
the service was the best part of the meal.
the chicken parm was like eating a shoe, seriously dog food.
go here for eggs and don't try anything else.
waitress didn't offer to take if off the bill.
should have ordered a plain bagel.
my husband enjoyed his eggs benedict on a bagel.
fresh grapefruit juice was good.
wait staff was nice.
place has a happy, busy vibe.
very bad and shady business!!!
wait staff is horrible.
when we asked for plates, the waitresss essentially threw the plates on the table.
haven't ever had a restaurant experience where everything went wrong until tonight.
piece of crap.
need i say more?
we came here for my brothers birthday party.
oh god they had the worst customer service.
never coming to this place again!
never by furniture from here.
low quality products and horrible customer service.
bedroom set arrived without hardware and their attitude was oh well!
the only bright spot the delivery guys!
if i could have given them zero stars i would have!!!
i will never stay here ever again...
for the price the room was ok...
planet hollywoods suites are much nicer an 1/3 the price.
not surprisingly it was the same today.
but our waitress trinity was the worst.
and when i let her know my order was incorrect she got defensive.
i had to ask her manager for a togo box and the check.
this place consistently has the deli order station either not working or just unplugged.
i've ordered here many times before .
the first time i've ordered the pizza ,wings were amazing .
pizza was too cold .
delivery time was too long.
pizza doesn't taste the same like it use to be.
100 dollars folks!
i don't know many ppl whom have 100 to throw around.
i was in pain and left that office worse.
my gums were bleeding.
word of caution.
do not go to any southwest dental centers.
i can't believe i ate chicken from this place.
you could tell the employees hated their jobs.
the worst customer service.
i'd been planning to get a new piercing and had the time today.
well thank you for posting that information on your website, door, publishings- not.
my feedback being that they should post this restriction so people know this.
i've referred multiple friends and family, but say no more.
their main burger item came out cold.
don't waste your time.
go to gordon ramsey's....or some other berger place.
yes love his show and he picks gear places...
just jot his!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
honestly the food is ok.
red burrito menu is nasty though.
these people make me sick.
went to this place at 10 pm on a saturday night.
probably one of the worst delicatessen i have ever been to.
service was fine, but the food was another story.
was there thursday night at 7:40 and ordered two corn beef sandwiches to go.
they were almost inedible.
they were so dry and corned beef had no flavor.
i was embarrassed to tell my husband how much i paid.
have been to much better delicatessens.
this location is a joke.
i had an appointment for an inspection, simple enough.
waited an hour before they even pulled my car into the garage.
the guy who was working the front desk had zero customer service skills.
save your money and go somewhere else
dont recommend it..
the place is too expensive.
food is alacarte.
not worth it, not a great variety, & bland.
bathrooms allow guys in with women.
not a place for kids
huge cleanliness issues with the vehicles, poor customer service.
sadly it's just a matter of time.
this isn't the first time we've rented a car and it's been very dirty.
how difficult is it to have someone go around to maintain your vehicles???
i mean they charge a fee for everything else.
and no one ever lives up to 1-2 business days committed for follow up.
and the cycle repeats.
i asked, if that wasn't the problem was i going to be reimbursed?
no, of course not, and the problem on my phone was not fixed.
sim cards are free.
avoid this place.
the therapist is wonderful but the front desk is so understaffed.
long waits to check out
also what's with the gigantic buns?
they almost made the burgers inedible.
but hey, at just the waitresses are walking around in their underwear.
tldr: expensive, slow, and mediocre food.
this was an all around terrible experience.
the hot and sour soup was tasteless.
the pork fried rice tasted like it had been cooked in rancid oil.
listverse really didn't you can write one star.
one of the worst chinese restaurants i've ever been to.
the service was awful.
waited over ten minutes to be greeted at our table.
we weren't asked how our mel was until we were almost done.
oh and i wasn't informed of a charge for extra sour cream.
i enjoy boston pizza but i won't be returning to this location.
to small and cramped.
overall, one of the worst places in the valley to patronize!
check your receipt!
the menu board states a combo is $14.99.
that means everybody else was being charged the wrong amount.
that makes me angry!!!!
food was fine but i won't come here again.
probably the biggest rip off in auto glass in town!
i had a crack in my window and recently had a break in...
waste of money..
jus spicy raw masala and not cooked well too....
appetizers are horrible..
it's worse than taco bell!
mom and i ordered chicken tacos.
took one bite and spit out.
perhaps something vegetarian would be better.
the meat was questionable to say the least.
the bathrooms were also filthy and smelled like excrement.
would never return.
go with any other insurance company.
i was very disappointed with the churro "dessert".
it tasted ok...
but how can you say one thing in the menu and give something else?
probably not the best practice.
i wish i could show y'all these wings
marginal hot dog.
nothing innovative or delicious here.
i got a water-logged bun- gross!!
ordered a pizza to the lobby of my hotel, "the hyatt on w.
when i didn't answer, they straight up canceled my order.
poor poor poor customer service!
wish i could give cox 0 stars...
canceling tomorrow and getting direct tv.
if anyone here is debating go with direct tv!!
your get way more channels/movie channels etc and have almost no issues!
my fianc sat at the bar for a good 15min without any acknowledgement whatsoever.
groupon lady ?
yes these are house cleaners in training not like the rhino maids who charger.
140.00 for deep cleaning.
ok i feel confident in not having such services from groupon!!!!
i'm totally confused and do not recommend such unprofessional customer service from britney.
hope she doesn't own the business.
this place was the worst bar/club i have ever been to.
worst experience ever.
i went on a friday night and it is way too packed.
no room to dance, let alone walk!
that was my first time and definitely is my last.
every nova's experience is a bland one.
the service is slow, the products mediocre.
it's more like you are interrupting them when you come in to order something.
my coffee or tea is always served too hot to drink.
illusion of freshness not accomplished.
dishes was too small but cost was high.
we spent $100 for three small portion of dish.
do not pay tips cause the 15% tips will added to your bill automatically.
ok, great, not a problem!
i had to walk out because the smells were so toxic!
no fan systems, no air circulating.
i'm younger and this salon is geared at older people.
horrible customer service.
won't let me pay account off.
kathleen is worst customer service agent.
avoid these guys.
even after i switched agents, i am still getting calls from her office.
jen has a poorly run team and keeps terrible records.
i ordered a fruit bouquet for a co-worker of mine for her birthday.
i called to confirm after the order was placed.
i waited until nearly the end of the day, no bouquet.
so, i called again to see when they estimated arrival.
i wait nearly all day...
their customer service is absolutely horrid, it comes with the culture but come on.
overall i would stay clear of this place, there are more professional places.
aside the fun and the madness.
the food counter is packed with garbage food.
2 thumbs down for food and service.
worst experience at a doctor ever.
multiply times i have gone in there and get asked the same questions.
them being so busy and not giving the attention the patient deserves.
i highly do not recommend any family bloom locations!
that's not a good doctor in my opinion.
this is the worst starbucks i have ever patronized.
the barista are also sloppy.
the carmel goes in the cup not around it!
inside in no better.
yes , i've tried on two separate occasions.
every time i visit this location, i get zero help, rude employees.
i needed assistance at the brow bar, nothing.
several woman standing around gossiping & playing music.
they are bothered if you need assistance or an opinion.
obviously no commission.
if you like friendly & helpful service definitely visit another location.
these people do not care about their customers  spending my money where it's appreciated!
was not impressed.
it is no longer as good as it was formerly.
we will not go there any longer.
unprofessional,  expensive,  sloppy work.
do i need to say more??
anyway on top of that he didn't listen to me an forgot a meal!!
an now they r closed so upset with everything!
no sorry we got really busy or anything!
i will never go back!
an i work in food severs!
waited 40 minutes for our drinks, which where messed up twice.
food wasn't great at all, will not go to this location ever again
customer service sucks!
the lines are long, the place is i'm disorder, and they lack help.
one shoe was labeled a size 2 when in reality was a size 3.
no go!!!not worth it customer service is terrible zero help.
girl walks from back with attitude says something about what's needed and walks off.
locals especially stay away.
they will take your money and then tell you they need 2 utility bills.
go somewhere else where they know what to do.
should be no stars.
stopped at saddle ranch before coyotes game march 18.
party of 4 including my 4 year old grandson.
he told me he would take care of it.
waited another 20 minutes and the food never arrived.
terrible service, place was a mess and the restaurant was not even half full.
surprised on a monday the kitchen would close at 10.
such a shame.
earls helped us out.
short staffed, manager has no leadership and customer service skills.
tomatoes and onions were rotten, order was wrong.
why contact them when all i heard,  we are short  no apologies.
gave a one star because i had to give one.
thought i would give the "little guys" a try, but sure learned my lesson.
do not rent from this place, stick with uhaul for one way!
they may not be perfect but at least they're reliable!
she was pissed off that she might have to work till 5:00pm tonight.
what really makes this bad is the food sucked!
chicken fingers, unfries and water
i was really disappointed in this location.
it had the worst customer service.
i got the bowl,the steak meat and brown rice were cold upon its arrival.
skip this place.
the one in southern highlands is so much better.
everyone here acts as if its such a job to help someone..
oh wait it is!!!!!
you chose this job so don't treat customers like we're bothering you.
server was rude and had a bad attitude.
the place doesn't even have ranch......
what kind of restaurant doesn't have ranch ?
ordered kids meal pasta for my daughter and the pasta was still hard.
would never ever recommend this place.
never ever coming back again.
if i could i wouldn't give this place any stars.
this place is closed.
worst customer service.
they never get all the scrips done.
always a second trip.
never have all the scrips.
and they dont care
charged my card an extra $172 for no reason.
i attempted to call finance department and manager department.
both phones kept ringing and i had to leave voicemails.
never received a phone call back.
my bank is currently dealing with the issue now.
jeff was nice and the work seems to be good.
keep that in mind if you have a big job.
first of all, i would like to state that i did not eat here.
when i arrived, at 6:00 pm on a saturday night, it was closed.
today is september 13th!!!
worst food ever!!!!
nasty taste, cheap hamburgers, no meat on cheese steak and had a horrible taste-
their online betting is a joke.
today was the 7th time i've had to call about it making a mistake.
the manager will legitimately laugh at you like you're an idiot.
get an account at cantor gaming or stick to the in person books.
cleaning team was there, and they said they are closed forever.
one star for the chicken kaarage.
no star for the ramen.
they do not use real ramen; they use soba and call it ramen.
the broth was so thick and there was no flavor.
do not recommend.
had the buddha bowl salad.
it was really bad.
it had a lot of bean sprout, couldn't really mix everything.
the tofu tasted sour and not fresh.
tomato felt really hard.
i love soba noodles and they ruined it for me.
very dissappointing experience.
i always appreciate grill-top restaurants (especially hu hot), but the experience was terrible.
our server was inattentive and dinner took about an hour and a half.
we had to ask to get waters, then drinks, then salad and soup.
it seemed to be too much to even ask questions about the menu.
didn't help that we got sick that night, too.
wish i could give negative 5 stars.
not buy $10 get $10 free that the groupon was for.
don't sell a groupon if you don't want to honor it!
wasted an hour of my time driving to and from the store.
(groupon refunded my money) stay away from these scammers!!!!
it was even "rare", it was just pink......like it was still raw.
it was all nasty and i threw it all away.
you're better off going to a dumpster than eating this garbage.
place mal propre.
service pas bon.
toilette pour homme qui sens l'urine.
une des employer sentais tres fort quand elle a sorti de la cuisine.
bref, je n'y retournerais plus.
only a 3 person shop only 2 should be doing the work.
other places in the area that are so much better.
if you want cheap fast work go there.
the food is alright .
nothing fantastic .
the employees are quite intimidating and somewhat rude .
chuck is probably the only waiter that i liked .
have been here twice.
food is subpar at best.
you'll never see me again!
extremely dissatisfied in thei work ethic and speed.
okay, so i've been in to this bakery four times.
the first time was great and the cookies hit the spot.
today was the fourth visit.
i don't care if the cookies were good.
i will never go to this place again.
pretentious,  rude, and hit or miss on the treats.
there are better places to go.
got a surprise charge of $6 because we decided to share a plate.
waiter never told us there was an extra charge.
if we had known about it, we would have each ordered an individual plate.
i happen to come across this restaurant as i was driving down durango.
i ordered the chicken pad thai lunch special.
i wasn't impressed, i've had better at other thai restaurants.
service was a bit slow, took awhile to get my food and check.
this diner was absolutely atrocious.
the food was cold on multiple occasions.
don't waste your time and money.
do not go there.
why you might ask?
in my opinion, no.
only one person available and they have a drive through.
waited 20 minutes to find out they did not have lettuce or spinach.
funny thing is that they are in a sprouts and target shopping center.
food quality was poor, was disappointed.
nothing was great not even the service.
really disappointed in the taphaus.
the service was not good, slow at best.
we ordered chicken tenders and pretzel for starters, both were obviously frozen pre-made crap.
the same pretzel is cheaper at a dbacks game.
clue: get out of town now while you still can!!
do not visit the summerlin location.
i've called several times & keep hearing they're on the way.
this is the worst experience i've ever had.
located in a strip mall near the fortinos and beer store.
unfortunately, we had been getting progressively bad service and we stopped frequenting it altogether.
at this point i asked for a refund and we got our drinks elsewhere.
the howl-o-ween party last year was alright, but no way was it worth $10.
first time ordering from pizza heaven.
i picked this place because of the yelp reviews.
the crust was tasteless and soggy like wet cardboard.
i'm so disappointed.
slow and terrible customer service + flavorless food = never again.
was really look forward to coming here after being on the website.
the appetizers i had where amazing, the scallops are the best.
however, the butter chicken not so good!
we actually sent it back.
it's a shame, it's a beautiful little place, but the food was so so.
we went here based on yelp reviews...bad decision.
bottom line- don't waste your time or money here.
the food at this restaurant left a lot to be desired.
the vegetables were tough, hard to chew and digest.
that includes the so-called cooked vegetables.
the mock chicken was also tough, hard to chew.
we went as a group, and the acoustics were terrible.
we couldn't hear ourselves think.
the only thing i took away from this experience was gas.
i didn't like the food.
i won't be back there the amount of money i spend.
i would rather spend my money at roberto taco shop.
this place is horrible.
we bought a car from the wholesale auction from this guy randy the owner.
hosts/servers at this place are unbelievably rude!
complained that i will never return to fat burger!
wife went in for a color / haircut under a $50 special  they had.
they up charged her like crazy without asking.
they just "did" additional hair treatments to get her old color out ect...
she ended up with an 149.00 bill!
totaling to $438!!!
two are still pending, i will have bank remove both when they clear.
three trips in and it just doesn't improve.
no care in the world from the staff, wrong food, incorrect tab ...
the only thing i have tried from this restaurant is the pizza and ziti.
pizza was very bland, but not inedible.
the baked ziti was absolutely terrible, dry and had no flavor whatsoever.
i would not recommend this place.
so this studio recently had a groupon.
i called the studio 2xs to find out some general information.
i left a voicemail each time i called.
it sucks- i was excited at the prospect of going there.
on to the next.
the crust is 1/2 in thick.
my kids are used to the 1/8 in crust.
nothing like the slices we are used to for the past 10 years.
they said it would feed 8 people but not enough for everyone.
very misleading and no future catering will be done with them.
this is the worst customer service i ever had.
i keep trying to give them chances.
no wonder the bar seems to be going under.
its never crowded or busy.
they don't have that much selections.
their soup is plain as well.
just meat and few mushrooms.
there's better thai restaurants close by.
and im not impressed with customer service either
although the food is great, the service is just too slow.
i am not coming back here.
what can i say?
just see my review for bourbon steak as it applies here as well.
i accompanied my sister today to purchase some blizzards for our family.
asking the lady through the intercom, was futile.
to make matters worse our blizzards and shake were done horribly wrong.
i will not revisit nor recommend this dairy queen to anyone.
never will they get a dime of my money again !!!
he wings are jagged and he is still flying.
the worst customer service ever.
then it got here and it was the wrong pizza.
this is unacceptable.
better management is needed.
well the goat was good, the red chicken was good.
the food was palatable at best.
very dissatisfied with the overall experience and would not recommend.
water was the only option offered for drinking.
the yogurt used to cut the spiciness of the food was good.
what a waste.
will not be coming back to this location.
had the absolute worst experience here.
we signed up for the taco crawl and this as one of the stops.
they clearly have enough business don't want my business.
they shouldn't even sign up.
it will ring and ring and no one will answer.
use the number 480-461-7000.
avoid stockton dermatology if you possibly can.
thought i'd try again.
horrible service again.
these people don't learn.
nobody who works here gives a crap.
they don't care about their horrible yelp reviews either.
i should have stayed away but didn't take my own advice.
why is it they only have 1 person ever working in this place?
and he's always flustered and overwhelmed?
if you go through the drive-thru, be prepared to wait 25 minutes...
grade a customer service!
if i could give a zero, i would!
i went in preapproved with a letter and confirmation number in hand.
what a boring show.
one gigantic clich.
great for the grand parents though.
went for a birthday celebration.
have yet to have a good meal there.
we all got goblets, they are just gimmicks barely any alcohol.
pretty place though.
will not be coming back.
very disappointing and inconvenient experience.
can i put 0 stars.
so much for gaming....
i want to fall asleep....
and there's no food...
don't know how this place stays open
this is definitely one of the worst moving companies we've used thus far.
total nightmare to work with.
to alex's credit, at least he would take our calls.
they lost two of our boxes which was never recovered.
$3k worth of clothes and bedroom items gone forever.
food was not good at all and it was cold!
we paid $34 per person which is not cheap for brunch.
that was so gross!!!
wash your hands!!
it's convenient and maybe one day i will give them another shot.
won't be back...
never even acknowledged....
find another place to eat...
lovely interior,  absolute shame
don't let their cheap ass flight ticket fool you lmfao!
she just said will bring  you french fries..
but she never got back to me..
worst loan company ever.
the loan officer is so hard to reach.
never answer my phone calls and never reply to my emails.
it was a nightmare.
she never gave me a straight answer.
a big no-no!!!
i purchased a groupon from this company for 5 rooms of carpet cleaning.
i scheduled service for 3 rooms a hallway and a staircase.
i opted to go with a national more reputable well known company.
i usually enjoy panda love the honey shrimp.
usually i'm good because that item is cooked fresh until....
and the rice were actually hard stale rice balls.
i was left out of food not to mention  expensive airport food.
total garbage tonight.
first the line was ridiculous...i can tolerate that if the crew is efficient.
(they were not)second, half the entree selections were sold out.
(8:15pm)third, my chow mein tasted burned.
lastly, the mushrooms in my shanghai  beef were cold!
how do you possibly butcher everything this bad.
epic failure panda!!
go for the nails not the wax.
all in all definitely not worth the 900+ a month in rent!!
with no one even waiting in the office there are hour plus long waits.
i was hoping for a good mexican meal but instead went to los olivos!
the ambience was ok; the food bad.
i do not know how she does it.
that was the final straw.
i left $20 on the table to pay for our order and we left.
haha like the other user said...
the customer service is non-existent...
zombie workers that just don't care..
"can i get a spoon(4my sundae)" -uh i guess, hold on...
how else was i gonna eat it...
i'll pass on the lid, that might have your head explode.
small sundae was 439, 329 at hwy7
very poor costumer service.
it was cancelled because they didn't receive the aircrafts they were expecting in time...
a new set of aircrafts (or some b.s.).
we were notified three hours before our flight.
we were notified three hours before our flight.
could practice more sanitary and hygienic practices.
for instance washing hands after taking orders and dealing with money.
food is similar to cafeteria food but they did have king crabs.
the salad selection was extremely limited as well as their sushi selection.
by far the most expensive taco shop i have ever been to!
no rice and beans, just the quesadilla and rolled tacos!
needless to say, i will never go to this place again.
will never use them again!
the guys are too busy smoking weed & not doing their job.
this place needs a new manager or something it's ridiculous.
like how long does it take to make 3 cookies and a smoothie smh!!!!
rude, unprofessional, unreliable service.
they do not show up for appointments, then reschedule and don't show up again...
then they want to cancel service because you complained.
save yourself the aggravation and use company with a good reputation.
this is a joke!
went here for the first time today - not impressed at all.
without knowing really what to order, i ordered the frybread and red chile.
hardly any meat at all in that gravy.
if i ever do go back, i'll definitely try something else.
my one and only time coming here.
workers got orders wrong, they work hard but just not smart (efficient).
needless to say, i left and have cancelled the groupon.
proceed with caution!
i'm really not sure about this safeway.
i think i'll try and avoid it as much as possible.
worst bank with the worst customer service i've ever encountered.
definitely won't be back if i don't have to.
prices still high even going out of business.
see ya sport chalet...
this is the most manipulative company i have ever dealt with, ever!
so i did...guess what?
these people have the worst customer service and care zero about their customers.
stay far far away from progressive!
they are a rip off!
went here today and was very disappointed to find it closed around noon.
looked it up on google and saw no phone number.
now i see a # on yelp and instagram
the workers here are not friendly or helpful at all.
wouldn't recommend this location to anyone.
it used to be quite good, but sadly it was underwhelming and disappointing.
that mackerel sashimi actually includes most of the tail!
and the chicken and mushroom skewers...
we're mostly skewer...
#fail #fooddisappointment #sobad #notgoingback
my apt was at 4 and i'm still sitting here waiting and it's 5....
i'm thinking of walking out in a second
came at 9 pm on weekday, already started cleaning (closing time was 10).
they said they will still serve.
i really miss kuhar's.
worst restaurant i have ever been.
the service is slow, bad attitude of the staff.
i would not go there even if they gave me the money.
waited ten minutes.
we didn't get acknowledged.
no hello, no hola.
someone walked in after us, and got there ice cream first.
we walked out..
empty handed and sad.
and it was very hot in there, some of ice cream was even melting.
not worth the money at all!
go to 5 guys or even smash burger.
mediocre food for to much money.
i tired their instacart service out and it was terrible.
poor customer service skills.
and they do not care about you.
i want a refund and they said no.
never use them ever.
i bought a bike from them.
drove from san diego.
they would not go down $200 dollars on the bike.
and they lied about my bike trade in.
and then they brought my bike down by $800 for a bike check.
they screwed me over and their customer service sucks.
they are rude and not friendly to deal with.
i would never recommend them to anyone.
leslie zak is pure evil.
i understand not sugar coating things, no.
this woman is evil.
she says rude remarks throughout your entire visit and is rough!
a rough gyno is a no go lol.
she got mad at me for not answering her questions quickly enough!
terrible bedside manners and their office is dirty as fuck.
worst mcdonalds i've ever been to on multiple occasions.
always out of something, awful, rude service.
don't come here.
they said absolutely and to bring it on down.
when i got there, the doors were locked but there were cars outside.
one of them saw me, looked up, and looked back down.
i won't and none of my vehicles will be coming back.
i asked why , she said they just don't.
so...i'm voting with my dollars.
i'll go somewhere else.
i can not rate this place.
they only sell ice cream...
the food was okay, not the best i've had & not the worst.
i wish i yelped this before i actually bought my food =\..
i had the chicken artichoke mushroom.
ordered delivery on a sunday evening: one veggie combo platter and lamb tibs.
they assured us that they would send the missing food out right away.
after another half an hour, we gave up and cancelled the order.
very frustrating - needless to say we won't give them a second chance.
prices were relatively same as new cartridges.
staff was friendly, but huge mistake here.
tiny sign on back counter warns of leaving cartridges in car heat.
when i called, they said that "yeah, we're supposed to warn you,  sorry".
we live in arizona!
kind of a big deal, cartridge world.
worst customer service !
sign said that it s opened at 11am.
there are customers waiting in front of restaurant at 10:55am !
it s ridiculous and rude !
this place is ridiculous.
had an appointment, set by another fastmed in tempe.
went home and came back five hours later for a set appointment.
waited over an hour to be called back.
all the while, she said not one word to me.
this place is horrible!!
attempted to check this place out on a friday night.
the address listed is the same as the park place pub.
went for a friend's birthday.
bought a bottle, to stand in the middle of a crowded room.
really rude doormen.
tried to place an order over the phone.
guy on the other side was saying stuff i didn't understand.
i go into the restaurant.
everyone there was speaking arabic.
no one helped me.
it's a shame.
places like these are usually very friendly to all customers.
i'll simply go to those places next time.
they had the same little tricks when a friend recently moved!
use this location at your own....believe me you will be at risk!
horrible place to rent a car if you are coming from the airport.
the place is far from the airport and was not convenient at all.
i ignored him and went to go check out.
please up date information, they are temporary closed until end of june.
but this is mid of july now.
it feels bad i went there with door closed.
why would you go to this place?
chances are you drove by 50 good restaurants and buffets to get to it.
real medium food for the price.
i understand the draw- crab legs, sushi etc.
but this place is not good.
it's old and dingy just like the rio is starting to look.
just trying to save others the time and option of choosing a better meal.
sorry rio but yuck!!
this place is terrible, your better off eating mcmuffins than here.
i turned around and asked if they were serious.
my order took a while to arrive and not correct.
the fries were super cold.
and it also took about 20 minutes to get my 1st coffee refill.
i would strongly not recommend this joint.
total rip off if going for abirthday or get together.
tried to reserve 2 bays for 10 ppl to get together and hang out.
website says 35$ an hour per bay.
went to a timeshare presentation.
nice units but far from the strip.
no bus pass was needed.
he just showed us the door and we took the shuttle back.
2 hour presentation turned into 5 including shuttle time.
i understand quality but?!
30 bux for 2 sandwiches tho?!
and that's without chipz, fries, or drinks  #yikes...
i coulda made these sandwiches at the crib .
don't get mad, you know itz true...
of coarse besides the aforementioned issue they found several other issues.
so i had to take it in a third time.
no discounts offered or even a heart felt apology.
wack as hell red beans & rice with super salty ox tail gravy!
they have the nerve to charge 50 extra for the gravy
this company is a complete sham!
only, they would not cover the compressor repair.
if i could give zero stars i would've.
horrible service x3,  horrible sandwiches x3  don't waste your hard earned money.
heard that this location is going to be demolished.
it needs to go sooner than later.
worst store i've been to.
you can never go in and out quickly.
never enough cashiers.
don't eat here!
phil the manager is a jerk!
i was utterly disrespected, we are not drinking in excess with our children.
horrible customer service and return policy.
(when it's obvious it came from lucky jeans).
this is an overpriced lunch restaurant serving dinner and it's still overpriced.
the "dim sum" was doughy and the sauce wasn't very good.
this is dinner, folks, the menu needs to be better.
and seriously, you can't manage to fill a glass of water without prompting?
should have saved up for a chef.
management doesn't care about your problems.
we were told our pizza would be here in 30 to 40 minutes.
what a great night uno you've done it again!
perhaps the worst "italian" restaurant in which i've ever eaten.
* dark and noisy.
* the bread was goodnever going back there again.
because that kind of thing never happens in italian restaurants.
cox communications is by far the worst cable provider.
the customer support team via telephone are just plain rude and know nothing.
room is fine.
this time the man was talking to us as if we were incompetent.
disappointing hair cut.
my hairstyle got ruined..
once i find out what it's for, i will update.
stay away from this company.
i have had nothing but problems and cannot get any help from this company.
i finally give up.
will be forced to fulfill my contract and then i'm out of here
i didn't have any work done here nor did i purchase anything.
i asked about getting an aftermarket iphone integration kit.
there are much better places in the city then this.
even as it pertains to paid advertising spots if that's the case.
absolutely horrible experience unless you're looking for a one hour hotel.
what more could you ask for?
oh, don't walk barefooted in your room-you never know what you're stepping on.
just as bad as stephs attitude.
everyone tonight was complaining about the horrible service.
i wasn't the only one.
no ice in the drinks.
no cheese in the burgers.
dirty establishment super slow service and steph was rude and disrespectful.
lovely selection of dresses...too bad about the terrible service.
do you want substandard care?
run far away from here.
we ordered the $34.00 ribeye steak and salmon.
i'm writing this review as i sit at the restaurant.
don't even attempt to eat here.
denny's food is just whatever but the service sucks.
my fork had food on it for one.
i wouldnt recommend this location
very disappointing and a waste of our time!
if you don't want my money no problem i'll take it elsewhere.
this store clearly has a customer service issue that needs to be addressed.
no witty comments this time.
the buffalo chicken wings we're crunchy, sour & no heat.
over all skip this place unless you're starved after gambling.
it's really not that hard to make a hamburger.
a good amount of meat, don't overcook it, and top with fresh ingredients.
drinks only from now on i guess.
one month later.
no response to my e-mail.
i've already saved a fellow caster from buying one of their retail-plus-priced rods.
too bad; i really want to keep patronizing this, the closest shop to home.
bad business decisions, appalachian outfitters.
you've lost me.
the gluten free chocolate cupcake is dry and tasteless.
the texture left a lot to be desired.
the frosting was good but forgetable.
very expensive ($5.40 with tax) for such poor quality.
this place by far is the worst bar i've ever been to!
they are all rude!!
you can not have fun at this place because they will kick you out!
food was terrible.
clams had enough sand to build a sandcastle.
sauce was tasteless.
ordered veal parm, got chicken.
only good things was the salad and the cappuccino.
don't waste your $
there were chunks of canned tomato in the biryani, butter chicken and aloo gobi.
which makes me think italian.
the biryani was completely inedible, a complete assault.
it was expensive and terrible, i will never eat there again.
i recommend that you steer clear.
i should have known by the smells when i walked in.
sorry i don't normally speek bad about a place.
we bought a restaurant.com which was $10 for $20 worth of purchases.
we will never be back.
and combined with awful customer service like that, they won't make it very far.
i had an appointment with dr. olga.
wait time was 3 hours and the staff was rude.
she didn't listen and filled out the wrong prescription.
the guy i spoke with on the phone was a clown.
he quoted me $285 for 300 square feet of sod, delivered.
he then refused to sell me the sod since "we don't do pickup".
terrible customer service and lousy business ethics.
i ordered from southwest sod instead, with no problem
what a look !!
this is not a family restaurant
went on saturday night for a birthday party.
food on the other hand, that another story altogether!
the replacement order of cod was very under seasoned and lacked on flavor.
staff was extremely friendly and helpful.
but only if the food matched the scenery and the staff.
i bought an upo squash to cook for dinner.
i spend average 50 to 70 dollars on that store!
read the fine print that they don't tell you about.
brisket was good; however all sides dishes were not even average.
this was our first time but definitely our last!
we had mac & cheese, beans, potato salad.
don't recommend wasting your money and time.
i would put 0 stars if it was an option....
for being an establishment in vegas, step your game up.
this place is just absolutely terrible
i will never set foot in a cr again.
it was jus5 rude and upsetting.
if i could give this place a zero i would.
this place just left a bad taste in my mouth.
felt so uncomfortable there.
was really looking forward to the place too .
rip off called for small plumbing problem technician had no part in his truck.
wanted to leave water off for 24 hours he barely spoken english.
this place is a joke
ordered chilli chicken -all 3 times was dry.
i need to find another good hakka place.
what's so hard about delivering hot food and the sides that we ordered?!
worst customer service.
they won't make it right so don't try.
same as the other reviewers: literally the worst service i've ever experienced, anywhere.
worst store ever.
don't go there.
this place sucked!!!
manager said lunch was on him and my card still got charged.
what a waste of time and money...
go to chik-fil-a !
the rest of our meal was okay.
we did order a milk but instead got coffee???
honestly should have just paid the extra few bucks for ihop.
it takes forever to get clothes cleaned from here!
then they criticized me for only bringing one shirt.
they obviously don't appreciate their customers and don't want your business.
i drive a 2017 volkswagen suv.
i would not recommend wasting the time to have your car "washed" here.
horrible experience, staff at the customer service desk were extremely unprofessional.
then cussing while having personal conversations in front of us.
just hanging out like they weren't even working.
i was extremely pissed and would never go back!
i will stick to target, thank you very much!
not even worthy of a star.
but had to select one in order to post.
charged a good bit of money.
suggested that we replace with a battery powered workings that he could install.
they manufactured a replacement part and had the clock repaired 3 days.
it is working great.
with such a huge bowl they only had 3 dumplings in...
doesn't cost a lot to give a customer 5.
the milk pudding with red bean...
i wish u can choose hot or cold..
only served cold....
worst experience ever!!
ordered online to avoid the counter line.
the online line took forever.
literally waited 30 minutes longer than if i'd ordered in the counter line.
whole point of ordering online was missed.
go to twinsburg!!!!!
drove 22 miles (one way) to find they decided to close early today.
guess it's a hit or miss with these guys.
close to ten minutes had passed when i decided to leave.
i still had two people before me, in the one and only available line.
i'll give them a chance some other time.
my friend had recommended this firm to me.
finally, this morning...i called their office myself.
i explained in depth to the receptionist what i had experienced.
they won't be getting my business!!!
don't waste your time.
bang bang burgers and five  guys is so much better all the way around.
not impressed, total chaos.
total waste of money.
service was a joke.
drinks were weak.
was the worst time ever, couldn't stand my waitress who was mia all night.
don't waste you money go somewhere else!!!
sad that it's all about the money.
crazy that clinics like this don't put the patient and their needs first.
i've been in twice and i can say the service is very poor.
the sales guy answer couple question and left.
i wanted some advice but didn't get a chance.
second time the two salesman was too busy chatting.
i felt like they didn't want to help me out.
the price is expensive from other places.
never again go back!!!
service was pretty much non existent.
prices were way over the top.
we walked out.
save your hard earned money for some place you might actually get waited on.
ok, seriously people...
i stop for coffee on a regular basis with a breakfast item.
so far so good unti......
i ordered 2 breakfast items- a sausage burrito and a yogurt parfet..
hmm mm got to work and discovered that the yogurt wasn't in my bag....
2 items and they couldn't deal...
sad shape if you ask me.....
1 star only because there is 0 stars
i have had great italian fare from ny to new jersey.
the noodles are obliviously not homemade.
the sauce bland.you throw down nearly 30 bucks for crappy commercialized italian?
the food and atmosphere is great!
but the servers are so rude i had to go with 1 star.
we had a group of 7.
for 7 people to order over 200$ i expect better service.
i'm really disappointed because this is one of my favorite stops.
.isn't what it used to be.
barely any store opened anymore.
the waiter did not come to the table for 10 minutes.
the drinks took 15 minutes to come out.
they got there as we were leaving.
if you want to wait for ever and be ignored, go to this restraunt.
i think it may be time to implode this vegas landmark.
new menu now.
all side items ala cart.
very expensive for what you get.
doubt we will ever be back.
the day we went for lunch at noon time the place was dead.
service was below standards.
prediction is this unit will close at this rate.
wound up ordering soup and salad.
salad was about the worst dinner salad ever.
i ordered the curry chicken roti by delivery.
at least the other reviewers had some potatoes...mine was mostly sauce.
i had about 4 tiny potatoes and about 4 tiny pieces of chicken...
i wish i was kidding.
the roti upon arrival looked flat.
i suggest you go elsewhere.
good job amc - you put a bar in.
k thx bye.
but that is not the case now.
ended up having to send it back and get something else.
won't be going back.
this place has super fast service but that is about it.
the bread is terrible.
it is dry and stale.
they also have minimal topping choices.
i would rather wait the extra few minutes at subway for my sandwich.
car wash is a joke !
the smog includes a cheap express car wash.
what a dump.
this has to be the tightest parking garage i've ever seen.
it's super confusing and old and the patrons reflect that.
just walked out on a $20 order,disgusting pigs.
use it to buy some gloves, and a food handlers course.
my guests ended up paying for their own meal....
due to a health issue i requested my membership to be canceled.
i would not recommend this place.
went to christmas eve dinner with my family of 12.
we had a reservation.
will never go back there again.
not so satisfied, with the service made.
very incompetent, in working.
with this shop, could not fix.
my check engine light.
drive back, and wanted more money!
and i paid hundreds of dollars.
with just, replacing a gas cap.
you be the judge...
since new management has taken over this place sucks.
it is a giant rip off to top off the insult to injury.
will charge you for a bunch of work not related to the actual problem.
well i never lived here.
you have to love the find my iphone app!
you could see it was in one specific section of the apartments...
it's that kind of friendly place.
my drink was superb.
shame on you.
i am appalled.
i will be making a formal complaint.
very disappointed in clothes mentor.
some still have tags on and from last season.
not worth it!
will not be back.
i was here for over 20 mins waiting for a simple ice cream cone.
it takes literally 30seconds to do?
not to mention they weren't even busy.
wont be back here again.
sad because i love mcdonalds.
just didn't feel welcomed once i got my cone.
first off u wait...
then wait some more.
shady and a rip off.
no wonder they don't accept returns under any circumstance.
crooks and stupid.
what a disappointment.
went online and read reviews.
staff at the beach club said it was $75.
that's not a way to treat locals.
unless you have time to waste don't bother going here!
that was her reason for leaving me and going to this little girl.
the problem is with the service.
normally i tip well,  but no way this time.
it is safe to say i will never be eating at this establishment again!
it came off as really rude.
worst club i've ever been too.
they rob you of your money for an awful time.
seemed like staff didn't care.
should you eat at this particular chili's?
which is why the choice comes down to three factors: how hungry are you?
how long is your flight?
and do you have an aisle seat?
if you're hungry, and you have a short flight, you can chance it.
very bad exp, they microwaved frozen food and cause all small pieces in container..
he told me good luck and hung up on me.
i called back and tried again and he told me to "fuck off".
worst sushi i've ever had.
i got it to go, otherwise i would have sent it back.
the wasabi smelled strange and the vegas roll was mushy, cold, and stale.
i only ate a couple pieces and threw the rest away.
i had another roll that was supposed to have spicy tuna and tempura.
it was also mushy and there was nothing spicy about.
i smelled a piece and it smelled straight up funky.
i love sushi but this stuff turned my stomach.
don't use this agency.
they give state farm a bad reputation.
they don't disclose information properly.
thank goodness i found a much more honest customer friendly agent.
the only positive is that i will never have to eat there again :-)
i used to love virgin america, but no more.
very unreliable and unfriendly service.
no notice of delay whatsoever.
not happy at all.
they must be under new management/ownership...because this company is awful now!!!
i personally had an incredible experience with das.
i received emails of the cars location while in transition up until arrival.
unheard of....it was definitely the cheapest of all the quotes i used.
our order: two glasses of wine and an order of olives.
how difficult is that?
never got our olives and didn't bother reminding the waitress.
we sat at the bar on a tuesday night.
bartenders were simply not attentive in the least--it was not busy.
we had an open tab and wanted to drink and eat!
it was like pulling teeth to get their attention and get an order in.
had to ask for utensils and coasters for drinks.
just not what i expected.
this is the most overrated restaurant in montreal.
rude staff, unprofessional treatment of costumers.
the service level and food is sub par  for the price.
we will not be back!!!#
if you bought your mac used, dont bother bringing it here.
i will never buy anything from your store.
this is a tough one.
this restaurant is a lot of fun, has reasonable prices and very good food.
even take-out usually takes over an hour!
by far the worst boston pizza ever based on service.
worst service ever.
if your looking for a place to sit, there's plenty of seats.
maybe now i know why there's plenty of seats.
thanks for the waste of time you d bags!
the food was not good for the price you pay.
everything was bland tasting.
it all looked good on the plates, but the taste was just not there.
we were excited to try this restaurant for the first time.
however, we could not even be seated.
very bad customer service skills.
i expected more from a local small town restaurant.
this if for their driving not food.
you cut off a bunch of people as you ran a stop light!
glad i was further back...
im sure it wasnt that important for you to do that.
i was in town for a business trip.
it was late.
i was hungry.
it was far from awesome, it wasn't even that good.
maybe breakfast is good but...wasn't willing to go back.
i was charged an extra $2.00 to my credit card without my authurization.
my friend was charged $9.00 more to her credit card.
again keep your recipt.
i hope they do something about this but i doubt it....
it takes them forever to make a freaking burger!
nobody knows what they are doing!
not the first time here!
every time its the same thing!
never coming here again!
went here with a group for bridal party hair and make up.
they made the bride put 50% down for hair/makeup for each bridesmaid.
what a mess.
the day of the wedding when we got there it was chaos for them.
visiting scottsdale, arizona usa from france in may.
came in for fullset because of the 40% off promotion.
polly did a terrible job on my nails.
i had to deal with ugly nails for the whole trip.
would not waste time ordering from them if possible.
scribed me extremely high dosage of vit d without even checking my levels.
and if you have lots of extra time, go see her.
and her receptionists, haaaa lazy ass girls.
hers, raspberry cake was fine.
the bread pudding was at best, a scraping of the pan.
about 2 tablespoons of mush.
whoever served that portion needs to work in some other field, perhaps brick laying.
no pride shown at all!
waste of hard earned money.
our first and last time here.
invited two friends, as well.
eight appetizers:  all inedible.
the chef must be practicing cooking.
dropped a rib on the floor; told two waiters not to trip on it.
they acknowledged with "thank you" but never picked it up.
told the server that i am allergic to dairy.
found out she didn't know that cheese was a dairy product.
and paid dearly for this experience even at happy hour.
this place sucks today.
chinese food is set up totally different here too.
this place is horrible, food sucks service is ok nothing crazy.
maybe it was my server but i was very unhappy about my experience here.
my husband and i used to frequently go to the rainbow location.
we tried this location since it's closer to where we live now.
i'm disappointed with the food at this location.
the fish cake at this location is overly cooked and made my stomach hurt.
the larb salad also tasted differently.
bank manager, when your atms are down, jump in and help your one teller!
don't stand at the door silently with an odd grin.
horrible experience here.
cons: -our waitress smelled.
i'm sorry to say it but she had terrible bo.
staff didn't send multiple referrals to other specialists as promised.
this place is an absolute nightmare.
the cop confirmed it was her and gave the id back.
never coming back they will ruin your night!!!!!!!
he was a taller caucasian male on friday night on the 16th of april.
first time in the shop, was not greeted.
sat for 15 minutes, than was greeted.
instructed that i had an appointment.
the barber was surprised, realized at that moment an appointment was booked.
the purpose of an appointment is to adhere to it.
you never who can walk through the door.
i'll have to take to walmart and fill them
if i could give this horrible shitty company a zero star i would .
please beware and do not ....
i repeat ....
do not rent from them !
they are xo artist and they do everything they can to keep your deposits!!!
we have called over and over and over and emailed and zero response!!!
this is the absolute worst company i have ever dealt with .
for brick style pizza, there are better tastier places that put more toppings.
this is the worst pizza if you care about taste and temperature.
will prob go out of business in a year or two.
this pizza place is as dull and slow like mid day.
never bringing or recommending to anyone.
my son after a bite said, this pizza sucks!
about 15 bucks a personal pan, not even worth it.
targets personal pan pizza hut way better
should have read the reviews before going in.
i said ouch and complained because that ish hurt!
well 3 weeks later i have bruised nails and looking ugly thanks to her.
i paid $10 never again!
really disappointed in textbroker customer service.
textbroker will not support customer issues.
search for other ways to get your content.
stay away from their service dept.
my fiancee took her car there and paid for services that were never performed.
the general mgr lied to us.
i originally made a reservation online.
apparently their system auto assigns an available unit.
once onsite, the manager suggested a different unit (easier access).
no problem with us.
meanwhile the price had gone up.
no problem, said the manager, he would honor the original price.
not so, when i check my bank statement (signed up for auto pay).
the rolls that we ordered were fine but the congee was very bad.
i ordered fish fillet congee and there were fish scales in every mouthful.
it's the worst congee i've ever had.
you better make sure you talk to some one before you order on line.
they took my order, but never delivered.
nor will they answer the phone, or reply to email contact.
i will never use them again.
ok so this place has 300 reviews and 2.5 stars....
like a quick no.
i was in shock.
ok there you go.
this place seems like they don't honor appointments too well.
i had a consultation appointment that would have literally took 5 minutes.
the last two times have been horrible.
the front desk staff have always been great though.
i used to go here all the time fast service and decent customer service.
had to wait 10 minutes for my food.
i won't be back.
i'm extremely disappointed.
poor customer service!
would not recommend.
server did not acknowledge or apologize for 2 burger orders taking 30mins!
i mean there was only 5 tables in the whole restaurant, including us!!!
server name em. serious thumbs down!
no knowledge whatsoever.
they took over my property and were able to turn all water features green.
then they tell me they have to drain the pool for $150.
i will never come here again to get my eyebrows done.
this place is a joke.
this is the second time we experienced this.
it's like they don't want us to buy their pizza.
i was a patient here for the last 5 years, but enough is enough.
several issues, starting with the office staff having a horrible attitude.
then you have the wait times.
i tried this trick, no luck.
use this office as a last resort.
stay away from all labcorp businesses if you are getting your blood drawn.
if you research labcorp there are many lawsuits of similar injuries.
loaded nachos are not good.
cheap beef and cheap processed cheese sauce.
watch the game and have a beer is all one should do.
i don't think any grilled cheese sandwich could be worth that.
so, the review is for policy/process and not food since we left.
we both ordered the prime rib, and it took forever to come out.
the meat was bland, unseasoned and tasted like it had been boiled.
we were eating for about 7 minutes.
very rude mike!!
after doing my very complete homework i was told this was not true.
took my car there as it was not idling properly.
when i got my car back it wouldn't even start.
total waste of $1,000+ in repairstaking them to small claims court.
very rude on the phone.
when it first opened the food was great.
but unfortunately, it seems to be going downhill.
they started serving pepsi, which i can't stand.
the meatballs where fantastic.
i will never eat here again.
really miss the old bld!
wont be back
i bought a groupon for this restaurant.
i tried to use it less than 24 hours after it expired.
the owner flat out refused to honor it in a rude way.
the wait and lines are terrible!!!!
either way, you can judge a restaurant's cleanliness by their restroom too.
i am feeling nauseous from eating there.
i still wouldn't eat at this location again.
do you know what diminishes a good meal, nice drinks and ok service?
a giant roach in the filthy bathrooms.
and the fact the servers were indifferent about it also sucked.
you're seriously telling me there was no manager on the floor?
and that includes finding a fucking manager when you have an upset customer.
he said it would cost $75.
he did waive the $75 service call charge in hopes of doing the work.
why is he in business?
and further, please be clear with customers about costs and scheduling.
really not good food.
very disappointed when we received delivery.
2 burritos - food was super bland.
meat was dry and the tortillas tasted as if they were several days old.
should have ordered from our usual - el molina down the street.
always good food, tasty and fresh!
winco supermarket (highway7&woodbine) is selling the dead seafood!
the flyers are mention the geoduck is on promotion.
we brought geoduck and lobster, they used two bags to package the seafoods.
after we opened the bags, the geoducks were stinky, and the lobster stopped moving.
we was very mad that why they are selling the dead seafood on purpose.
we never bought the dead seafood on the counter.
but we never met a supermarket such this evil
service is not the best!
also the bartenders don't care about you or what you want to drink
terrible customer service.
the girl that helped us didn't know anything she was talking about.
i felt like we were a bother to her to be there.
thanks to sylvia, i won't be back with my business.
read the review it tells you what the issue is.
this company is unbelievable
i am a chef, so i was clearly aware of what i was eating.
gigantic menu full of confusing words.
no chicken balls?
took 3 hours to arrive, driver followed me inside after i forgot to tip.
very intrusive behaviour, if you ask me.
would not dine here again, my wife said she wouldn't dine there again either.
would not recommend.
i wouldn't recommend this kfc my worst enemy.
we couldn't stomach the food and returned everything.
some of it was overly salted and others tasted like chewed up dog food.
the filet mignon was over cooked and tasted horrible!
service was serviceable.
food was awful.
we ordered bbq wings and general tso wings.
we were told they were preboiled then fried.
the meat was stringy and very unappetizing.
there was pink juice secreting from every wing.
we were told the wings were fully cooked and not to worry.
don't let this happen to your loved ones.
you can do so much better on the strip.
5/15/13a quick update.
didn't get compensated for the aaa call.
was late to work.
people were cool in the office.
my cousin and i went maybe a month back.
man i feel like i had my first sushi experience all over again.
my first experience i got some foul smelling fish and food poisoning.
the price is cheap.
i was hoping it would ramp up because we came just before lunch.
but the place stayed dead and no new food came out.
horrible service, mediocre food at best.
the place is extremely dirty and the lunch wait is too long.
bought their pizza to take home and bake.
the marinara pesto sauce was brown.
whats up with that?
not impressed so won't be buying that again.
i've had their pizza in the past & it was good.
this place sucks.
their patio was also poorly designed.
i would suggest staying away from here.
worst hotel experience.
the so-called "non-smoking" room (164) reaked of cigarettes...!
there was even an ashtray in the room on the bedside table.
i complained to the front desk and she was no help.
the sink was also leaking and the shower head was spraying at every direction.
this place is a dump.
i would never stay here again!!
$32 for 12 wings and two beers.
food was ok.
beer was ok service very marginal.
they both did find time to spend quality time with a couple of regulars.
the place was pretty empty and i see why.
won't be back.
i had the worlds worst cheese steak sub.
three bites and it was finished.
the hot italian sub was average at best.
cheese fries are your every day cheese fries.
the portioning compared to pricing is way off.
that is all.
finally delivered after three weeks past my expected delivery date.
not even worth dealing with their horrible customer service.
everything looks great after concealing some of the damaged pieces.
if you're going to shop at ikea pick it up yourself at the store!!
this place is not worth your time.
they serve subpar quality food and brand it as healthy.
their chicken is not real chicken.
terrible customer service at this center.
poor room service, poor management, poor design.
even motels have coffee machine.
stay away from this hotel, there are lots of better hotels on the strip.
the saving where  not there at all scam!
i am filing a report with my bank.
rooms are old, tired and dated and dark.
would it really hurt to have a little light in the place?
will not be back!
security staff is a joke!
black friday ad says they have iphone x.
went to a different walmart and said the same thing.
i nearly choked from all of the perfume.
by the time i got to counter they were already out of several items.
there are literally dozens of other better more interesting places in phoenix area.
their indifference to the customer experience is simply inexcusable.
worse than red lobster.
food came out soggy and disgusting.
probably frozen seafood and not fresh.
this place is the epitome of bad customer service.
always short of help and never kind or courteous.
this is a 24 hour inconvenience store.
only come here in an emergency.
expect the worst.
beware of this location!!!
he smiled, said "no problem" then printed out my booking.
she's probably right, but this is a pure bait and switch operation.
the two personal banker and the male teller i encountered were slow and indifferent.
they were laughing and joking about subjects that shouldn't be discussed during office hour.
worst customer service i have ever got.
they didn't give me any utensils for my meal i had to ask.
they really need to work on their speed of service and quality of service
so disappointed with my food today.
i ordered chicken soft tacos to go.
i had the same thing a few days ago and it was perfectly fine.
whoever cooked the chicken this time should probably work the register!!
sorry, there are too many other nail places around.
we will never come back again.
if you want a nice place to have a drink with friends go elsewhere.
mediocre beer selection at best.
it's no wonder this bar is in a tourist heavy area.
this is the nickelback of bars.
same situation as other review.
i couldn't believe it.
unfortunately new ownership has taken over the restaurant.
unfortunately, the food quality was subpar on both occasions.
needless to say i will be looking for a new go to spot.
the 1st time i figured it was just busy and not the norm.
uuuuuuuunfortunately i've since gone back a few other times and "the survey sayssssss" they....
(insert sad, hungry face here).
my husband bought me a massage here for mother's day.
this is a terrible way to run a business.
the wellness clinic is a waste of time.
thanks for nothing walgreens!!
scam artists, over priced and awful service.
first visitdining area cleanthe male manager has no customer service skills.
paid for everything.
i don't like the gravy, which is why i order the potatoes without!
and i was ripped off a whole regular sized side.
maybe the best in vegas.
sorry to say if i could give it less then 1 star i would.
i used to love this place, but no more.
btw, do not believe the glowing description of the suites at the mandalay.
at this point i would move to a decent marriott courtyard in a blink.
the room is worn and not that clean either.
you've been warned.
this place sucks ass!
i probably would never recommend this place to anyone and would never come back.
the service is horrible!
the blonde cashier was ( obviously miserable)and intimidating.
to the brunette -- my san fran was better than ever!!!!
to the blonde -- get a new job.
the bar tender was so rude and didn't even want to hear my complaint.
this place really made my day!
called another place (happy's) who really made me unhappy.
good thing someone filled me in on pizza house.
thanks pizza house!!
i give it no stars!!
came back to tanmax to start again.
they want me to pay for two months i didn't go!!!
they said i never cancelled.
i tried calling but no one answers the phone.
this is after being a loyal customer for over 4 months.
if this is how they treat customers...
the woman was extremely rude to us.
we are well dressed and gracious people.
there is no 0 stars or words for my disdain of this company.
if i could go back i would never have signed with this company.
avoid at all cost!
food was horrible.
service was good.
cleanliness was excellent.
i tried it three different times.
quality of food was a disappointment each time.
they dont accept anything but visa/debit cards or their own sams club credit card.
they are a giant corporation and can afford to accept all major credit cards.
im  disgusted and will never ever shop there again.
i don't think so.
i've seen better sides on cereal boxes.
worst customer service i've ever witnessed.
the attitude and the lack of attention is unbelievable.
disappointed every time, they're tacos don't even come with salsa.
this store would make anyone claustrophobic.
future mac purchases will be made at nordstrom.
average bagels, but that's not why they get one star........
the woman behind the counter who helped me, was abrasive and gross.
additionally, she was fairly abrasive.
for my order, thankfully she put on gloves.
perhaps she noticed that i was watching her (?).
the maze takes about 3 minutes to go through.
then they tell you to try it backwards.
cool idea,  just super small.
do not rent from this company.
lines are long and slow at the mccarran airport rent center for this company.
i had made my reservations several weeks prior.
this happened to other people in front of me who also had reservations.
we are sick and tired of this location mainly because of the doctor.
the stupid doctor says why didn't you take your son to his pediatrican?
avoid this location!
do not rent from here!
they did not even pull up our reservation or profile see what had happened.
they were rude, condensending and made snarky commentary.
for your sanity, i would avoid this location at all costs.
other than anthony, who is a gentleman, the place is a shit hole.
the staff the last three times i have encountered are one word "contankerous!
"the young, s mutt blond bartender was rude and condemnable.
plus there was nothing gluten free on their late night over menu.
the crowd seems odd too...but 3 strikes....your out in my books!
really disappointed in our pizza.
we ordered take out tonight - one pepperoni and one margherita.
never going back here...which is a shame because it's a great location!
but it's 3 weeks out!
this is ridiculous, and it's needs to be addressed.
3 stars is not an accurate rating for this lab.
absolutely terrible service, which is a shame because it completely outshines their delicious food.
we called later to let them know what had happened.
we will never do business with this business again.
not how you treat good customers.
the square taper should have been left behind years ago.
now my husband has stubble and unevenness not even 24 hours later.
take an up to date course and learn how to fade.
service is so slow!!
like a snail.
expensive as well, but this is to be expected.
the staff is so rude!!!
called them and the manager said he was too busy to speak with me.
could not believe his response.
i was appalled.
the manager literally told me he was "too busy" to speak with me!
horrible customer service
i must have been here on the wrong day.
we were out shopping and decided to stop in for a burger.
the place was packed and it was pretty cool inside.
that was a big mistake.
several of my friends go here often and love it.
this store is very similar to most dollar stores except for one thing.
there is always an extremely long line to check out.
i've been there at 9am and 8pm doesn't matter...line of at least 6-10 people.
don't let your home warranty company send them.
there was an empty part where the hair dryer should have been.
no one came during the whole night.
this is appalling.
we stay at many different hilton hotels and usually the service is very consistent.
i found this puzzling.
i went on monday after work and they were out of filters.
the guy told me they were getting them in the morning.
i went tuesday late afternoon, was told the same thing again.
never  come to this place!!
worst korean bbq ever!
worst server ever!
will not refill your water or sides!l until your full!!
not only did i find the receptionist uninformed, i found daniel rude.
if you think of sonic think of fake.
this place has the worst milkshakes in the history of milk shakes.
trust me it was horrible.
there was no chocolate in the thing.
sonic has definetly lost my support.
if you want a shake from sonic, just get milk from your refrigerator.
we found this place in our hotel book.
thankfully we decided to drive to the restaurant instead of ordering takeout.
the refrigerator had no door.
needless to say we got out quick!!
glad we saw the condition of the place before we ordered any food.
this place should be closed down.
food here is below average.
i ordered a stew with pork.
very bland and watered down.
my other friends had an okay time here.
so trust me.
please do not take your vehicle to this place!!!!
if it was possible to give zero stars i would.
i had to walk outside my apartment and physically go and grab her.
and after she was rude and her apology was terrible.
probably never going to order from here again.
food is mediocre, service sucks.
used to be a decent spot back in the day.
plenty of better options around.
went there october 2013 thinking a hotel on the strip would be nice.
this hotel is a dump!
my rental car got keyed in their self park garage.
i would not recommend!
i did not give him a reason to talk to me this way.
he doesn't know me.
i left that practice because of him.
all of the need to smile a lot more often.
just a sad place to goi found another pain specialist, dr dallas smith.
great place to go.
they have it, but i don't want it even at 1/2 the list price.
salads can be turned into a wrap, okay cool.
ordered the caesar salad wrap.
wasn't great at all.
grab the fruits provided and make it right then and there.
i could give 0 stars but it won't allow me to do that.
unless you are a dirty biker type, you will not be welcome.
they don't check ids if you're a person of lighter skin.
*kiddos for yall* but i hope they get shut down since that is illegal.
friendly mart ?
more like rude and ignorant mart
food and drinks were great once we finally got them.
i never write reviews; however, this place has the worst customer service!
they over promise and under deliver.
i strongly recommend not going here.
supposedly "trendy" place.
long wait on a friday evening, but that is to be expected.
the food certainly wasn't great.
not bad, but certainly not all that good.
our waitress clearly didn't want to be there.
but i'm pretty sure our waitress hated us.
if it's on the menu, get the corned beef ball.
avoid the risotto, the chicken ball and the government cheese mac n cheese.
do not let these guys touch your plane!
long history of aircraft damage caused by mechanic and also linemen.
shameful korean food and side dishes being served up to unsuspecting, nice white folks.
why is the soft tofu soup lukewarm?
where is the egg?
where is the stone bowl rice?
why are the side dishes so bad?
i'm ashamed for you, red kimchi!
we have been trying to eat here for months.
we pulled up today @3:15pm to learn they close at 2:00pm on saturdays.
5 and diner here we come.
sorry but just no!
the breads were just awful.
i question a lot of establishments on spring mountain.
if you want a better updated version of this place...
go to serenade cafe on rainbow blvd!
we where robbed!!!!
the bread was amazing by the way!
after picking up my food i decided to stop by the bar.
10 minutes and 40 bucks later, no drink, no approach, no service.
in fact the guy was rude to the one guy he was talking to.
oh well never again.
worst airlines ever!
they were not helpful at all.
i will never fly them again!!!!!!!!!
garbage service, garbage food loaded with butter, not fresh, super greasy.
my husband and i had a stomach ache all day after that disgusting meal.
so extremely rude and an awful experience.
never ever will i go back there.
i will never select "one day shipping" from amazon again!
these imbeciles tried repeatedly to deliver to a business address at 8pm each day.
if i could i would give them zero stars.
we were told our sectional would be ready 4-6 weeks.
now we are being told it will be ready at the 8week mark.
there was some delay and they never i formed us.
horrible service will never recommend them to anyone!
i can't even begin to tell you how overpriced the wine is here.
we paid 65 for it.
never have i seen a more overpriced bottle of wine.
this place needs to get over itself!
where do you think you are new york?
if you really cared you would have refunded way more than the over tip.
the waiter confirmed that they only used macadamia nuts.
very disappointing, particularly for the price.
they are trying not to honor our 10 year warranty on our windows.
they sent out a postcard saying that all warranties would be honored.
wish that was true!
ordered a pick up of small boneless wings and potato wedges tonight.
we found chicken pieces and left over stuffed  mushroom in the potato wedges pack.
my wife is a vegan and this is totally unacceptable..
never again here..
i use to love this field!
their prices are higher then ever for gun owners and the fields are empty.
this was the second time i have been to this salon.
my nails have already started chipping and it is only day 2.
i will not be back.
i showed up at 7:08, waited my turn and was helped at 7:15.
7:17 i was told it would be another 10-15 min.
7:45 i still didn't have my food.
over an hour to get 10 wings some mac & cheese and a soda!
the sales clerk disappeared - came back without shoes and walked past me.
joe completely ignored me.
the store was not crowded.
he simply didn't feel like helping.
i went to nike and ended up buy
out of two menu items.
this place used to be decent, but is now in the dumper.
i look up and see waitress petting a dog.
thank god we got our food first.
i said no thank you and can we get that other waitress.
we had to keep asking for our food and repeating our orders!
i would not go here for another birthday celebration.
i have never left such a small tip before in recent memory (10% only).
be careful, this place is way over priced.
i know thai fairly well.
i've spent a while in thailand and cook thai a few nights a week.
this is not thai food.
it's not fresh, not all that flavourful, and just not worthwhile.
you could make a better panang curry with a store bought sauce.
i went to see a doctor on a saturday recently as a walk in.
i will be looking elsewhere for a family doctor and clinic to go to.
i was part of a wedding party that hired this company.
suffice it to say, save yourself the trouble and don't use this company.
please have some consistency!
then at times like today, soggy and undercooked.
this customer service is seriously lacking.
going somewhere else.
i couldn't stand this place!
i am actually very surprised other people gave it a good review.
aside from the service being very poor the food was nothing too exciting.
i was also brought out the wrong drink too!
my date ordered a salad which was not bad, but not very good.
i had the sweet & sour chicken, but was not impressed at all.
it should be free, with free water!
anyone have charter internet/cable provider?
costumers should demand for refund.
charter seems to have the worst history for the worst internet provider.
is there other any internet provider out there ?
charter monopolize the internet industry but the services sucks!
the only decent thing was the orange chicken.
this is probably the worst $60 meal i have ever bought through uber eats.
she was being very rude and was of no help.
please hire associates that have better customer service skills
i'll skip this one next time and find another gas station.
just had dinner at mr chow at caesar in vegas.
the food and service was really bad.
ordered the noodle which didn't have any flavor and only lukewarm.
the filet mignon and chicken were ok only.
the service was slow.
i will never go back to this restaurant ever again.
i don't recommend this restaurant!
i would rate this 0 star!
despite being a caesars diamond member, i had a terrible experience.
the manager was abrupt and rude.
it was such a bad experience, we walked out before our food arrived.
i would not ever recommend this restaurant to anyone.
my husband and i went to this dunkin donuts expecting a good meal.
we had the worst 77 page inspection.
they wrote that the beams/rafters were cut.
no, this is how the builder put in vaulted ceilings.
an inspector should know that.
he broke a cabinet and left it.
put the air conditioning down to 72 degrees and left it.
this inspection would scare any potential buyer.
not very educated for a home inspector.
the guy that answered the phone was totally rude.
he repeated his question "do you need a van or a regular car".
i hung up.
i did not know what a regular car meant a hyundai or a suburban?
he would not help.
bad bad service.
although, it's a beautiful place, but the portion is tiny and it's over priced.
on top of that, the desserts are very blend.
not much flavour.
quote was $60 for 3 days, return the p.
car and get a bill for over $220.
haven't been bent over like this in some time
this is a "half-way house" not a rehab facility.
if you care about your family member, do not send them here.
run by a very mentally abusive onsite staff of past clients.
they are not professionally trained to work in the rehabilitation field.
there is no counseling provided.
not only will your loved one not improve, they may get worse.
surprisingly bad actually.
shrimp tacos had two small shrimp in each.
pork tacos had less than a tablespoon of pork in each.
my wife combined her shrimp to get one good taco off the plate!
even the margaritas are bad -- watery and overpriced.
it's not even passable as bad drunk food.
save your money and go to tavern or phat burrito.
the worst delivery company in all the land.
how can a delivery company screw up delivering packages so badly?
i would never use this company by choice.
it is a shame amazon uses them.
terrible customer service and seems someone skipped cleanliness school.
not sure pga tour did restaurants because they should stick to golf.
luckily not as many food remains around our chairs.
our server who actually brought us the check was ok though.
what a waste of time money and calories.
$45.00 for an asian sampler,lobster bisque and a salad.
now i know why we haven't been there in a long time.
we wont return to much competition out there to  just be mediocre.
maybe it was the lunch crew?
so don't bother.
try another place.
i won't be returning.
yes the manager comp'ed our meal.
but our waitress was completely indifferent and service overall was terrible.
but i don't blame our waitress.
don't make me beg for food and drink.
the whole time i felt uncomfortable.
they barely spoke english and afterwards demanded a tip.
this is not and urgent care it's wait time is like 3 ours.
it's faster to go emergency hospital then here.
bad decision to bring my kid for en x ray.
slow people not friendly i don't recommend.
waited longer than told.
people walked in after us without appointments and they took them first.
not good customer service at all.
we waited to be seated while the waitress just looked, we eventually seated ourselves.
after sitting we waited a good 5 minutes for the waitress.
we got no suggestions, no warm welcome.
the cherry on top was the ridiculous prices for the portions they give.
staff are very rude!
absolutely hate the service here.
hire better people!
always welcome by sulky and gloomy staff.
workers are very very rude.
i could have saved more money with pods then getting a rental truck.
i'm just glad its over and pissed i use my money for their services..
do not use them for a long distance move!
i made reservations for a party of 9 for my parents anniversary.
he was visibly irritated, and incapable of holding back his frustration and emotions.
ordered intermatic timer.
card charged immediately.
in stock, three day delivery.
tried to contact them and email address not valid.
telephone mailbox is full.
they work, so it says, from 9 to 3 whenever.
don't order from these guys.
google search will show you all the ripped off customers they have.
veryyyyyy slowwww...if you are in no hurry this is worth a shot.
good food and decent music.
terrible customer service and unsuccessful at fixing the problem, don't buy from 1-800 flowers.
i usually don't eat fast food, nor do i buy it.
however today my son asked me to get him burger king.
so i went by there.
i asked wendy what comes on there bacon cheese burger.
i won't be going back there ever
save yourself some money and find someone else.
just like all the other reviews.
been 3 months and never received my shirts i ordered.
these guys are a scam.
don't order from them!
i was just blocked from instagram.
ordered their 'most popular dish' on the menu - fish and chips.
please step up your game management!!!
check out browns social house!!!
after asking for 7up, she gave me sierra mist without telling me.
this is not a professional taekwondo studio, it's a day care.
some former army guy who thinks he's captain america runs the place now.
forget this place.
the gm and the female mangers here are the worse.
asked what happened to brittany they said he no longer works here.
they then helped her.
let's hope osha walks in to see this.
always horrible service and rude workers.
i would not recommend eating here.
how do you give some other human bean a zero (0)?
he is a black gentlemen with a bald head and looks to be x-military.
how do people get these jobs?
good thing this guy did not sirve on my ship!
i would have had him sent to the brig......
you're a poor excuse of a military personal.
bring back my caprese plz
i should have listened to the other yelpers.
our meals were cold, hard to cut and just not tasty.
it's not like they were busy either, it was only like 11:40am-12pm.
just not a good restaurant.
sorry melrose, the view is the only thing worth going for at mapleside
i was very excited it try this burger joint and was very disappointed.
i ordered a hamburger and they made a cheeseburger.
i sent it back and told the guy i didnt want cheese.
so he made it again and guess what, it had cheese again!
they didn't even offer to comp us for  anything.
i also thought it was dirty.
the floors needed to be sweeped and the trash needed to be emptied.
with so many other choices out there, i won't go back.
this is the worst airline ever.
cancelled flight and making me call to get a refund?
will never fly again.
husky was recommended by our home warranty company.
took them 8 days after call too come out and look at washer.
anyway they didn't fix there customer service is not good.
i would not recommend husky.
everything is always sticky from spilled booze and the crowd is annoying.
there are so many better places in madison.
kenny assured me the cab would be there at 4:45.
i sent a text when we returned from our trip, no reply.
the front desk lady ana was very cold and impersonal and rude.
my visit was from a little while ago .
..i was less than satisfied.
and my visit was not for anything  contagious.
that's just an example of how i felt.
i went to her based upon a recommendation i received from another doctor.
i've been to better dermatologists before & since my visit.
it was disgusting.
the pretzel was flavorless even though it was covered in sugar.
it was not even chewy but just flavorless dough with too much baking soda.
i'd avoid this place at all costs.
first time here...last time here...natch.
the most not authentic mexican meal.
i felt ill for two hours after probably from bad meat.
tacos awful and food was cold.
i would not recommend
owner is super nice and does amazing job!
all others sucks badly!
you lost a great repeating client.
$65 for this?
drank my rum and coke, and sat patiently for another 25 mins!
before he looked at me and asked if i wanted another.
i wish i can give this review zero stars.
the course is below average.
but what really made the experience awful was the service.
i don't understand why they put employees with nasty attitudes in the front desk.
the service left a bitter taste in my mouth.
never ever order from here because your flowers will never deliver.
unfortunately, there were times the kids couldn't climb because there weren't enough staff.
they couldn't even be bothered to hold the door for me.
i was really disappointed i couldn't fully enjoy myself.
i was either stuck in the room setting up or busy serving food.
eh, i wasn't impressed with this visit in particular.
i love the idea, but this visit in particular wasn't very impressive.
have not heard from anyone, and it's been months.
would never recommend.
charged extra for a lot of services that others offer for free.
charged for a key but then the key wasn't able to be made.
they were closed multiple times when their hours stated they were open.
i'm a parent and my daughter insisted on living here with friends.
it's old, appliances are impossibly cheap and everything keeps breaking.
and, they fine the kids for everything they can.
i would only consider this place if every other apartment in charlotte is full.
i strongly recommend people shop elsewhere
why 1 star?
really bad food.
twice i went ask for thai hot but it was blend no test.
do not recommend.
slow during sunday lunch, hostess sat us immediately.
hostess was chewing gum and wearing white and pink socks, very visible.
she left dirty plates on the table.
we ordered the bacon wrapped shrimp, which was great.
ordered the crawfish bread and gumbo, both horrible.
talked to a manager marcalla and she was accommodating.
liked the decor, so we sat down to our booth when the waiting began.
come on $26 bucks for a palm sized piece of fish???
i wanted to really support this place but we will not be going back.
i'll stick to stone and vine.....
this company is a scam, buyer beware!
they just want to get paid without providing a decent service.
ne parlons pas du service nullissime et du manque de professionnalisme de la maison
class action law suit please!!!
charged me more one time and less the other.
guess u have to know them.
i would not go here ever again.
horrible customer service and  price fluctuation in the items they sell..
any other smoke shop is your better bet
horrible customer service.
id rather keep my clutter than sell to this place.
until they hire new employees at least.
marshalls has better prices and they're not second hand.
the worst bank ever!
hidden fees,  unresponsive management...
nothing ever to feel like you matter as a customer.
boy do i miss moms real authenic cooking now!
the cantina chimichanga should have been taken home.
it was too big and my dog was hungry.
booked a room, and was told it was a quiet room.
had an early meeting, and was not planning on staying up all night.
at least the party drowned out the airport.
the hotel is tight in the flight path.
what a mistske!!!
they couldn't "push the coupon through".
i won't return to this target and will not recommend others to shop here.
the store manager needs a wake up call.
i come to xawaash all the time and everyone is usually so friendly.
lemon chicken was extremely dry, even with sauce.
beef and broccoli, tasteless.
cantonese noodles was on par with the rest of the meal.....tasteless.
overall overpriced and plain.
don't waste your $$$.
needless to say it's a terrible place to order food
i'll go elsewhere and buy a mattress.
just ate at this place and found insects in our food.
do your self a favor and don't eat here.
no joke i was ready to leave before i ever received my entree.
slow service for no reason.
the restaurant was half full and employees just not on the ball here.
they're  too lazy to even take the cover off the pool to clean it.
if the cover was on, the pool wasn't getting cleaned.
what a pos company!!
they changed that.
no overnight parking left of the gas station.
we take the bus to chicago to save money and not deal with headaches.
went during summerlicious.
i notified the server, who was extremely condescending and told me that "really?
you think it's over cooked?
overall would not recommend, and would not go back.
they sold me a fish with monster ich!!!
avoid, avoid, avoid.
they just cancelled our valentines reservations too.
:( desperately trying to find an alternate place.
something seems not right..
was sent off in several different directions by several different employees,to no avail.
everyone should run from this shop.
he then went to insult my family, parents, and culture, and i am american.
elevators and garbage rooms are dirty and stink.
cockroaches are a common sight around the elevators.
the new asst.
and here we are with no water since noon - a pipe burst.
no sign of a plumber and it's now 4:29...
this is an all too frequent event.
this is the worst doctors office i have ever been to.
the staff is rude, the place is always overcrowded.
filled out m new insurance paperwork and they still charged my old insurance.
do not go there
i had to worst experience today....
and i have the powder dip color  stuck all over my nails..
i wont be back...
and they took multiple people before me.
i waited well over and hour....
i'm surprised by all the good reviews...
the service was quick and kind.
however, the food was not something i would try again.
his sandwich was two pieces of cut deli pork and was soggy and flimsy.
which truly stinks because i loved the mission that the company stands behind.
very poor service!!
when we went, it wasn't even crowned but still service was super slow.
there was one guy "mohsin" running around..
said okra & eggplant are same things..
then got two cups of same dish when we had ordered two different dishes.
then didn't get 3rd dish & said "sorry, aunty left" :(...
we were left hungry on a friends bday :(..
apparently the chef sneaked out...
food quality was good but overall terrible experience !
are they closing down?
315pm on thursday and doors are locked.
sux i just paid for parking ;/
i have the worst experiences here!
its disgusting, very creepy, uncomfortable and unprofessional!
so disappointed that i had to make my first yelp review.
first off, i upgraded my combo to add chili cheese fries.
turns out it's cheaper to order item separately.
i told them farmer boy combo with no onions or avocado.
they decided to just give me a bacon boy combo with onions.
five guys burgers are much better.
actually carl's jr. and burger king burgers are better.
what a waste of $16.
i feel so ripped off.
i was super disappointed by the food from here.
seriously, don't eat this if you enjoy actually tasting food.
my husband and i ordered 2 loveseats and 2 chairs from levin.
when we picked them up we did not unwrap the manufactures packing.
when we unpacked it the chairs had mismatched legs, different wood, style and heights.
then the loveseat was defective with torn fabric along the seams.
the customer service has been the biggest challenge of all.
no one can give me a answer.
this is new furniture that should be perfect.
i do not want it repaired otherwise i would have bought a floor model!
every technician they send out did the job wrong according to the next tech...
all in all 0 stars
cold burrito, time after time!!!
been to chipotle many times, and still get cold burrito's every time!!
figure it out guys!
it's not rocket science!!!
i was sorely disappointed.
the lunch order did not come with a drink, and the service was poor.
it was a decision between here and lolo's down the path.
wrong decision indeed.
i don't see myself coming back here anytime soon.
i ordered the cobb salad.
the croutons were straight out of a diy salad kit.
i should have just ordered a beer ...
but too late for that, i won't be going back.
case in point.
this is fraud.
he came back in later and apologized that he got it confused.
not he was trying to make mkney on us.
warning just get your vehicles washed there..
do not use him or his company under any circumstances.
this place is the worst.
we had ny steaks that were shriveled and tasted terrible.
we had salad that was wilted and tasted terrible so we couldn't eat it.
the ambience feels a bit like the rest of the luxor; tired and lame.
i honestly was shocked at how bad this place was.
in las vegas, this is the worst title company ever.
last week called talked to a heather wow does this lady hate her job!!
at the least brittany should  be training heather asap!
then when we got our order the first time, it had sausage.
when we sent it back, the egg was cooked wrong.
i am astonished !
always a long line with only one teller.
come on and schedule 3 tellers so you have coverage for breaks!
on here, their hours say they close at midnight.
lady with purple highlights always has a very rude attitude.
no longer coming back now.
lunchtime crowd and we were seated right away.
that's when we were "forgotten" !
even longer to take our order and i mentioned it to the server.
next thing is we're bring served by entirely different server.
which took even more time.
i didn't like the way we were served and the menu was weak.
i'm not going back ..,.
all the reviews.
including mine have been removed....
if you care for your pups , do not take them here.
look deeper for other reviews!
placed a takeout order via phone.
however, my drink was not ready upon arrival.
10 minutes later my bubble tea was still not ready.
why would it take more than 40 minutes to make a drink??
so what was the point of placing the order ahead of time then???
i asked for my money back and left.
saw all the good reviews so why not give it a try?
we'll talk about a mc  d crowd giving out reviews!
my crepes came out ice cold and filling was gross!
sorry won't be back!
no energy here, at least decorate the place and make it cozy!
more like 1.5 stars!
this place is the worse mexican food "restaurant" that i have ever been too!!!
the food didn't have salt, all of it literally taste like sink water!!!
the salsas were tasteless.
it was just a horrible meal all around!
silver state never returned my calls regarding cleaning services.
would not recommend.
the food here is gross.
cool environment, but gross food.
maybe rename it and call it a bst.
we complained multiple times and nobody did anything.
just dont go here.
when i got there, the items were not what i even ordered.
that's just not good management or customer service to me.
it's a mistake, i get it.
but make it right..
two shuttle rides away from airport.
others had been waiting for an hour!
he told me i needed to show him my auto policy.
no one does this.
plenty of empty tables, not enough staff.
i've frequented cora's places in halifax without complaint, but this was a shambles!
i had previously been very happy here but today the service was sub par.
disappointed as my first trip there was so positive.
i don't think i will be back.
i just left one of the worst meals of our life.
horrible, just horrible.
the food, the service, everything is just terrible.
the food was as bland and dried out as cardboard.
the service left a lot to be desired.
end game:  there are much better mexican restaurants out there.
they try and push $3000 dogs on you.
this store should be shut down for the way they treat/neglect animals.
they just want your money.
i can't believe i was fooled by this scam.
if i could give them a zero i would.
never let them come to your house for a home warrarnty service call.
even thought the a/c was installed to code.
walking into this place was a bad experience!
no one greeted us when walking in, waitress was extremely rude.
ugh we walked out and will never recommend this place to anyone !!!
not very good at all.
i stayed at the hotel and that was a great experience.
i would never go back.
please take my word for it, don't try the sushi...
but it has been going downhill the past few years.
i ordered the chicken tikka and basmati pulao rice.
the rice tasted off, like something in it was rancid.
it usually comes dry, not wet).
i am so, so sad to lose what was once a favorite, quality restaurant.
but this was our last visit.
that is unacceptable
how the hell in the world shawarma & donair place charges for hummus??
thats call being greedy.
this unit can not get their act together.
the sad thing is that corporate doesn't care !!!
the double standard was galling and saddening.
obviously, i have other shopping choices and i won't be back.
what a very poor business decision in my opinion.
that's the draw, but no more.
i will continue to patron postino's!!
thanks for the memories living room, you've just lost a regular!!
the food is good.
definitely above average.
but the service is so bad that it hardly makes up for it.
very disorganized and too expensive.
the band was late.
burgers were cold.
blues traveler was late.
not very professional in my opinion.
i was then told to basically forget using esprit.
i had this postnet location pack and ship a very fragile large heirloom.
they did a bad job and it arrived at destination totally broken.
owner never followed through on filing claim with fed ex!
now i'm out $500!
i'd never recommend them to anyone for shipping.
i am incredibly upset with the way my revocation packet process has been processed.
i feel completely cheated and cannot wait to be finished with this process.
i almost rather move out of arizona than deal with this kind of unfairness.
parking lot, ticket area and especially concession stations are a total mess.
theatre smells hot and dirty when you walk in the door.
concessions having the slowest, most poorly trained people i've ever dealt with.
i spent $1000 and this goddamn system keeps givinfgme problems.
it works fine then it doesnt.
(i bought 6).
i now have over 24 hours of call time w/tech support.
still waiting on my system.
spend your money elsewhere.
waiters kept walking by, saw us and ignored us.
when asked for menus the staff acted as if it was an inconvenience.
the bartenders are also inconsistent in their mixing.
first drink was entirely too strong, next one was watered down.
would not recommend to anyone
this place sucks!!
worse service ever.
i have no idea why amazon uses them, it really let's their customers down.
i hate you ontrac.
both crepes were burnt.
i will never go back that is for certain.
this is the worst place to live.
then the roommate who left called and said i had unapproved people living there.
now i have a 5300 collection from this corrupt place.
don't rent from them!!!
management should train their staff better.
double check your receipt when you leave, i was double billed.
otherwise nice facility.
quality of nails sucks..
broke after 2 days brand new set.
what kind of customer service is that.
over priced for poor quality.
never going back.
not sure how this crappy company stays in business.
we definitely need more competition in arizona.
cox has the worst customer service of any company in business.
if you have a choice stay clear of this company
now is a candy shop with taco and burito .
it looks like shit!
really, trust me.
never waste your money
but i have to write.
my companion's mussels were tough, and swimming in an unsubtle wine sauce.
these folks have a great location.
but they were so bad that i won't be back.
this place is super slow!
make reservations if you want to come here!
or else you'll be waiting forever!
we were traveling and ordered food over the telephone due to time constraints .
the aloo paratha portion size is huge and costs 7.99 each.
we felt that this is over priced.
food tastes good but the service is not great.
we ended up paying a lot more than expected.
dissatisfied with the experience.
they used to be 24/7 and now close at midnight.
no reason to come to this hole at all now.
been sitting here.
its been a half hour.
lets see if the food is good and warm.
that was the 1st & last experience of this place.
my food (take out) was sloppily put together and sloppily wrapped.
they were very busy admiring each other.
the food was average to not so good.
i purchase catering for my company.
pita jungle is not on my list.
my uncle recommended this place to me while i was in town..
this place sucks, i will never return.
i gave them 1 star because they were nice.
went there yesterday & got the finger/wing combo.
the fries were the best part.
the chicken fingers are like "tyson chicken fingers" & they taste like it.
sure you know the kind in the frozen food section.......
never ever again.
i live in this neighborhood.
worst bojangles ever!
service is always horrible.
food is always old/cold.
obviously poorly managed.
waste of money and time!
the food here is very over priced for what you are getting.
it is very bland and basic.
the serves is very rushed and slow.
ok i am going to update my review everytime.
again i asked for a everything bagel not toasted with butter.
i rcvd a cream cheese bagel.
only person there.
just don't get it karen.
7/18/14 trans#171737 what a waste of money.
might want to check and see if your employees even passed high school.
to be told that they can't do it.
waste my fucking time.
i don't know whats the problem but looks like they are closed.
i've been calling them for 2 days but no one is answering the phone....
the staff was friendly but the food was not good.
my husband and i ordered the joanna and the donna for dinner tonight.
we each had one slice and threw the rest  out.
didn't taste like pizza and the  crust was not done at all.
no offer of free pizza and no apology.
never going back, too bad, we like supporting local small business.
service at new location is horrible.
i do not believe mojave is such a company.
i would be glad to share the full details.
this place had the worst food i ever had in my life!!!!
they were very rude ..
dont ever go here!!!!!
decent food, terrible service.
would not recommend, will not return.
overpriced and awful service, no thanks.
as an aside get a pos system that has the capability to split checks.
the mgm hotel is very nice with many good amenities.
but the one thing there that wasn't very good was their buffet.
i wouldn't recommend it especially because if the price about 30.00 a person
this place does not know how to make an irish coffee!
at least the bartender the day we stopped in  had no idea.
for the whip cream they used powdered creamer.
there were little lumps of creamer floating on top of the coffee.
i cannot recommend this restaurant/bar.
the food maybe ok but we won't be back.
this skin care clinic is too expensive with almost no effect.
please do not visit this clinic if your concern is acne scars.
looking for a quick place to eat pho.
mistake in coming here.
the girl who took our order was unpleasant.
but marlix, the waitress who took over, was extremely kind, very friendly.
we keep given it chances but alway are reminded why we should never return.
service is underwhelming and very slow.
food is mediocre..
maybe new management would help?
do not use..we had 2 appointments to fix refrigerator..no show..no call both times.
never heard sorry..do not use.
won't shop here again.
i hate to say this but the service is terrible.
they charged us for the side ...
the waiter also was very obnoxious and dismissive.
will never go there again
my wife thought the food was okay but ended up with food poisoning.
i would expect something better from a restaurant in downtown summerlin.
go at your own risk.
this was one of the worst experiences at a restaurant that i've ever had.
he mumbled something to us and walked away.
there are so many other options in this area, why bother.
the food itself was fine, nothing special.
we're sad to say that we won't be back.
i walked out and they didn't even try to stop me.
i was there for 15 minutes and walked out empty handed.
:         visited this restaurant based on the reviews and it was a huge disappointment.
the service was shit and the food was barely edible and wayyyy overpriced.
i have volunteered at homeless shelters that served better food better than this.
if there is a rating less than one star anatolia would have earned it.
i can proudly say this is the worst restaurant i have ever visited.
very rushed and unprofessional polish job.
hadn't been to this place in years, now i remember why.
needless to say i will never be back.
not going back!
poor customer service.
watch didn't fit and they refused to refund or exchange.
only a matter of time before this store is shut down as well.
worst meal ever, even the alcoholic drinks were terrible!
i ordered clam chowder and felt sick afterwards.
my mother ordered the fettuccini alfredo and the noodles weren't even cooked.
the key lime pie was so tangy it was unbearable to eat.
straight to it - this place is not good.
yes literally half cooked.
don't waste your money here no matter how starving you are.
got food poisoned from this location.
i ordered a few dresses on 9/20.
and i still haven't deceived them.
this place sux.
and customer service fir online us worse i work in the fashion industry too!!
never shopping here again
terrible drinks, rude bartenders!!
they spend most of happy hour tossing liquor bottles and not serving drinks!
they do limit the 5 cent beers to 2 per person.
never going back there!
i ended up getting sick from the meat.
never buying meat here..
a little disappointed because it was my first time
hard beds, hard pillows, teeny, tiny bathrooms.
go elsewhere if you want comfort.
the photos are deceiving.
terrible nights sleep, back is aching from cheap mattress.
the service department is the worst!
4 weeks later my coolant reservoir cracked and leaked.
one of other mechanics asked around $200, but bmw service is asking $600.
they said it's not their responsibility not able to find my coolant reservoir crack.
i have lost trust on them completely.
as soon as your car passed the warranted mileage, they rip you off.
the know how to do it so well...it's their profession.
anyone try to buy any bmw, i recommend you not to.
i will get my bmw trade off asap.
way cheaper and better they dont charge extra for quac .
this review has nothing to do with the food.
i was not given a chance to try it.
don't advertise hours if you're not going to stick to them.
i was very disappointed in this restaurant.
little did we know that the kitchen closed at 9pm.
who closes their kitchen at 9pm on a saturday, especially in downtown cleveland.
the next day, my boyfriend and i got breakfast there, before we went home.
we were also disappointed in that.
they only offered a breakfast buffet.
i got a bagel and wanted it toasted.
the toaster wasn't even working.
my boyfriend's food wasn't even hot.
the food was alright, but the portions were tiny.
the bubble tea was terrible.
it just tasted like watered down tea with sand in it.
very loud place, slow service, food that was just so-so.
overall not very impressive.
pan roast and linguini with clams were very bland.
won't be going back here!
we arrived about 7:35 with the family.
we did not get served until 8:30 and it was awful!
i mean terrible.
it sure isnt the same place as when ben owned it for sure!
we did tip the waiter very well!
poorly run einsteins and the manager was rude.
how do you runs out of your most popular bagels on a weekend???
should be baking bagels all morning long on the weekend.
won't be coming back for a long time
i came to the salon for a color and trim.
very skeptical now.
how did someone give this place 4 stars.
it is pizza made from the cheapest possible ingredients, it is not good.
you will never find really good pizza from a national brand
it was a saturday evening at around 6, so tire shops are closed.
the employees seemed to have a "darn that sucks for you" attitude.
i have even called in and was sent to voice mail.
if they damage your car...good luck getting your money back.
the help is awful, rude and the food is sub-par at best.
then she was mad at us.
talk about a health code violation.
membership prices are exactly the same prices at vitamin shoppe and bodybuilding.com.
don't waste your $15 and buy a  yearly membership like i did.
the food court inside only had a pizza place left.
this time however, the good was not good and the service sucked.
we waited over 45 minutes to get our food.
my husband got the a1 burger and it was burnt.
i got the chicken wrap with the chicken tortilla soup.
the soup was nuke warm and the wrap was ok at best.
love dd, but this morning's experience at this location was awful.
apparently it takes 45 minutes to make a bagel with cream cheese.
really bad service.
went 2x to hope it was a fluke but no dice.
waiter named bruce was horrible.
we live in arcadia so love the great spots we have here.
but doubt will go back here here ever.
the staff at cornerstone ranch consists of undereducated, rude, obnoxious, lazy, poorly-trained, insipid jerks.
absolutely 100% despise these people.
knock on any door here, ask any resident...
bet you get the same response.
worst asian food i've ever had - nothing asian about except the name.
i ordered a beef special and a chicken special, neither resembled the photo.
they were bland, the beef looks like and has a texture of pork.
the chicken does not taste anything like the description
i'm so done with the halal truck!!
first time was great!
next couple of times, they covered my food in yogurt sauce.
stuff is so freaking hot you can't even eat it.
well this is the nicest sushi place i have been to for a while..
3rd time here and bathrooms are complete disaster.
a gas station bathroom is cleaner ..
then it took 45 mins to sit two ppl..
and after all that the conveyor belt didn't have anything on it ..
ppl are mad ..
it really needs to learn how to serve better food service cuz ..
they won't get my business again..
30min for one roll that's pathetic
he jumped my car and had me sign and then drove off.
as soon as he drove off my car died.
what the fuck!?
i didn't have a choice in using them because usaa set up the service.
still sitting here waiting for help...
horrible visit to sonoma rest.
on saturday eve.
they had constant attention and a visit from management.
we got nothing but an apology from our waiter.
i will not go back!!
today it didn't even deserve one star.
bathrooms were in bad shape.
the products are more expensive than other companies but the service is atrocious.
lately they have been horrible!
even some of their best techs have gotten lazy and sloppy!
i wouldn't go here please go somewhere where they will do a decent job
why does toby keith have a restaurant?
are they going to open a elton john pizzeria next?
the food here was bad.
just bad and priced high.
i don't recommend any of the dishes on the menu.
go somewhere else.
sat there at the bar for over 10 minutes and no service.
at least i got to take a leak.
like other reviewers, i too used a promo from travelzoo.
barely looked at us and seemed pissed off.
aren't wait staff supposed to be invisible??
- our dinner came with champagne.
it was served in plastic flutes.
i should've questioned the day old pokey sitting there...
it looked a little sketchy...
he assured me it was just better marinated.
i've had diarrhea and have been vomiting for two days.
don't eat here.
just an abysmal experience.
worst ever !!!!!
my car broke down and road side assistance dispatched phenomenal towing to our aid.
the tow driver took nearly to 2 hours to show up .
we were in the middle of vegas not in the middle of nowhere .
after sweating in the vegas heat .
i learned later that the tow truck driver stole from my car .
made me feel inhumane, unwelcomed, judged, and irrelevant.
you are fired
this is a poor excuse for a pizza place.
even in an area dominated by chains you'd expect better.
once you finally get your order in prepare to be disappointed yet again.
our pie had no taste except dough and not very good dough at that.
fortunately we have lots of better places to get our pizza fix from.
honestly if i could give this restaurant zero stars i would.
horrible service, horrible drinks (ordered the prickly pear margarita) which had absolutely no flavor.
also, ordered the house burrito...
a burrito with just refried would have had more flavor.
which was also served with a small handful of broken chips.
never going back there.
bad service, super slow and they charge extra if you pay with credit card??!!
never heard that before.
will never go there again
i spoke with you personally, i'm not surprised you don't remember.
funny that you went on and on about successful people.
did you have a point?
your "driven personality" really shows through on your reviews!!
my only issue with this place is with who had control of the jukebox.
played a bunch of songs and they straight skipped 5 of them.
not played over by play now but straight skipped them.
i said how come every song came on for 10 seconds before getting skipped.
me and my daughters were the only ones in the place.
our pizzas took over 20 minutes.
i ordered the 5 cheese pizza.
it was so salty i could barely eat it.
as if someone poured salt on it.
which i really liked.
it was that bad.
expensive and unhygienic.
i found some hair in my food.
sorry to say that!
not coming here again for sure.
customer service is very poor.
they don't seem to know what they're doing.
i eat pizza hut all the time me and my kids.
every single 1 of us is sick and is fighting for the bathroom.
i'll be making a call about this.
this has to be fixed.
would hare for any one else to get sick
last time inside the door of here for sure.
food tasted like actual plastic.
do not get the veggie omelet breakfast sandwich..
you will regret it.
took 15+ minutes for them to make when i was the only one there....
will not be coming back to this location ever.
from the time we sat down to paying the check...
how do you mess up a blt & fries?
i'll tell you how "cold and flavorless"!
cold coffee and floats in the water!
my husbands omelet and hash browns were luke warm and had no flavor!
absolutely worst breakfast ever!
these offices are terribly run with unprofessional workers.
if you are looking for a good manicure ...
dont go here!
could have done better myself.
don't waste your time or money.
it's very small inside, the atmosphere is rather boring and bland.
i ordered one waffle and coffee.
asked the server if it was "belgian" or "regular" waffle, she had no idea.
it was "regular" waffle and not belgian which was great!
anyways, the coffee was sub-par and the waffle was stone cold.
whatever that meant, an excuse not an apology.
she didn't charge me for coffee.
i would not return, i was not impressed.
this place stole my sewing machine from me.
they advertise they give free estimates.
they don't respond to it at all.
robbers without conscience or character.
called and asked if i could make an appointment with dr. linder.
i noticed there are two other md's mentioned on her website.
the receptionist did not mention if they are available.
they could simply put up a notice that they are not accepting new patients.
she had such a negative attitude that made me feel uncomfortable.
just finished my powerhouse salad with roasted chicken, quinoa etc.
the pancakes were not light and fluffy but hard to cut and chewy.
will never go back.
we come here sometimes , but today i am really unhappy with their coffee.
free is still a bad price for a pube sandwich.
do you have anything less than one star?
i remember better food in my high school cafeteria.
the prime rib was like shoe leather.
the mac n cheese was tasteless.
the sirloin was inedible.
mashed potatoes cold.
ranch dressing covers a lot of sins.
it was vgk game night so we checked it.
food was very sub par and prices high.
service was so so.
don't eat here.
if money and time are no object than come to the arena.
there has  been no announcements as to why.
no dj and nothing but waiting.
so if you have time and money to waste than it's a great spot!
i  arrived home from vacation to find a green pool and needed help asap.
i was very disappointed in my visit because of the food.
it also did not have enough meat on it.
not a great experience because of the gyro quality.
i am very disappointed.
i have ordered this soup but after today's experience i may not go back.
please check the ingredients before you serve your customers.
i am terribly upset
this place sucks.
the fish was seasoned with cinnamon,  really who does that!
it seemed to bother anyone in management.
find another restaurant.
i was not to happy not being able to leave her a tip.
slow and inflexible.
they prey on small customers who are charged with excessive fees.
this is a weird walmart in a weird mall.
everything about this place gives me the hebe-jeebees.
i saw a couple having a domestic dispute in the toy isle.
listened to several screaming children and wasn't greeted by the greeter.
seemed weird but we said ok.
never called us with the estimate and never returned our calls.
very disappointed, will never use again.
do not get waxed by zlatina.
i've never written a review before but i had to after this nightmare.
i've always loved european wax & every waxer has been great.
huge rip off.
small draft is 9:00, small bottle of bud is $7.50.
any pizza other than cheese is $5.00 more.
example pepperoni personal pizza is $16.49, mind you this is an 8 inch pizza.
airport food with ballgame prices.
skip it and head next door to four peaks.
never go here
order a pizza with mushrooms and mozzarella sticks from eat24 the online app.
food was gross and half an hour late.
service was horrible i wouldn't eat there again even if it was free.
so far so good.
nothing was crispy and the food got cold quickly.
it's been a few weeks now with no contact.
my experience was disappointing to say the least.
stopped at matt's big breakfast in tempe friday morning at 8:30 may 19th.
was confused with the set up, no hostess around.
finally a guy came from the back.
we asked to sit outside which we did.
it was quite embarrassing with his tone of voice!
rude people like him should never work as a hostess!
my wife went there during her lunch on athursday.
by friday all her nail polish fell off.
she said it was out her control.
needless to say my wife will not return ever
the food was two hours late.
the chicken and shrimp dishes were reversed.
the food overall was super average.
it's a shame because i had previously enjoyed delicious thai.
oh well, certainly not the only thai in calgary.
will never go again.
i tried to call to advise but no answer.
i left an message.
i also emailed them.
i will be contacting them about this.
was looking forward to trying out this cinema.
these place will go out of business because of poor service!
stay away unless you like dealing with a controlling bossy witch.
she loves to correct and control.
acts like she is doing you a favor to work on your appliances.
got annoyed when i wouldn't give out the gate code.
insists on a 4 hour window of time.
refuses to accommodate a request like a call ahead.
interrupts and acts superior.
how do they stay in business?
worst service ever!!!!
ordered alfredo with chicken and got no chicken in my pasta.
i most likely won't be back.
pasta wasn't good enough for me to return.
if i do, maybe i'll try a sub.
if i was able to put no stars i would...usaa has horrible customer service.
they accepted liability, it was no question that it was not their fault.
they do not follow up with the shop to see where the estimate is.
tried three times and all three were not good experiences.
the owner needs to learn how to be nicer to all clients.
as a result, i waited 30 minutes for my appointment.
can confirm, rudest office staff i've ever talked to.
there are lots of choices out there, will definitely be going somewhere else.
service just isn't helpful or friendly.
girl at the cashier needs to learn how to smile.
this is the absolute worst apartment i've ever lived in.
they people in the office are the absou worst, they never know anything.
i would never recommend this horrible apartments complex to anyone.
do not move here !!!!!!
the quality of the food is poor.
for instance the ahi tuna in crispy tacos smelled and tasted fishy!
my family ordered other dishes and were equally disappointed.
one star for the sweet and friendly server.
so, yeah.....i won't be going back.
we have been waiting for 6 months.
i ordered the spicy lo mein ahi tuna.
the tuna was ok.
i had a mammogram scheduled at the women's imaging center yesterday.
it was my first mammogram after completing chemo and radiation.
i cancelled my appointment and left in tears.
absolutely no compassion from the staff.
they sent the nice email below.
i gave them my info and no response.
i guess that when your done with chemo and radiation they no longer care.
my last appointment with the pa was mediocre.
she wasn't over the top friendly or interested in what i had to say.
it's a shame i'm viewed as unimportant.
once they reel their patients in for an appointment, they're done with them.
are you familiar with the plague?
no, not hanging out with it?
then you'll want to similarly avoid this place.
incredibly rude, and flat-out incompetent nail technicians make for a manicure you'll not forget.
i wanted a french manicure on my natural nails.
worst shrimp chow main i've had.........................................really!
dont waste your money.....cannot beleive what they serve you in also!
never have we been to an establishment that had such an air of pretentiousness.
this was the beginning of a most unpleasant dining experience.
save your money and eat somewhere else.
oysters were full of shell fragments, they served with a nasty green sauce...
cocktail sauce is the gold standard guys, don't get creative.
even the drinks were boring.
save money and use a different company.
this place deserves zero stars.
do not use them!
didn't like the atmosphere.
food is not memorable.
today was my final time.
too many nail shops around for me to take that.
food was typical canadianized chinese food (it's okay).
i asked for my change, the waiter stated the change was tip.
i will not come back.
the potsticker taste like the one from costco, the sweet beef taste like candy.
the portion is so little.
a lot of customer last night was so disappointed.
the saving grace is the ambiance.
what kind of doctor's office is this if they don't even answer the phone?!
i gave it one star because i had to in order to review it.
this is like the butt hole of pittsburgh.
take my advice and prepare the neighbors garbage a second time.....it will be better.
do not go here.
they condone animal abuse.
do not go here.
the dogs wont wake up.
they treat their animals in the pet store as if they were trash.
the dogs wont wake up.
if you attend this mall, you are giving it money to continue animal abuse.
you condone animal abuse.
i'm going through the same horrible experience like every other negative reviewer.
they've supposedly attempted to deliver my package, and failed because address info.
regardless, i called and clarified my address.
it's all bs like others have mentioned.
i didn't choose dhl, nor will i ever if it's up to me.
i purchased stuff online and the store used them.
dinner tonight was the worst!!!
every steak at our table was cooked wrong.
indian food is spicy , but not this kind of spicy!
typically buffet indian food is medium spiced.
now the food here is as bad as the service!
to name a few: passage to india,bombay grill , jaipur etc.
this place is horrible.
then they wanna hang up on you or curse at you on the phone.
if you want less stress during your pregnancy do not go here!
this place is not as good as it used to be.
it's run down.
$50 filet was just as good as texas road house.
would not come here ever again.
j alexander's is better and cheaper.
makes me sad.
food quality not good.
the owner holly is a horrible business person and very immature.
avoid this place at all costs and save yourself the stress and money.
ups account holders are refused service because, wait for it, "this is vegas".
there could be fraud.
they want the mark up even though my package was all ready to go.
i will be looking for a new doctor.
warning: bad sushi makes you really sicki love sushi and good deals.
but i will not be goin back to this place.
don't ever take allegiant.
i'm only leaving 1 star so i could write a review.
if i could, i would give negative stars.
wish i could give zero stars.
took over 3 hours to get the food.
not worth the money in gas i used.
the pharmacy is the worst.
my prescription is never ready when they say it will be.
never going back!!
scam look at the service coupons.
what a joke.
i was here several times years ago and i was excited to go back.
unfortunately they served me a pile of wet mush.
the whipped cream was all melted.
disgusted by the lack of effort to serve something decent.
contacted them via email, i was told they could help me.
said they were available and i replied 'what time'.
have not heard from them since.
don't contact them as they apparently don't need your business.
at this point i just need booze and food asap!!!
i ordered the buffalo hen and the flatbread of the day.
at this point i don't care so i wait....
this place was such a disappointment so not worth the time or money
i was treated unfairly by this establishment.
was told 10 min wait.
i sat for 20 min soaking in water with no communication from the staff.
this was very unfair treatment.
be upfront with your customers about time and provide equal treatment.
walked down the road to liz nails and received exceptional service.
zero stars wasn't an option.
about what you'd expect.
typical hilton treatment.
it's you're problem, not theirs.
stay on the strip.
not worth the money.
called yesterday and set up a consultation/quote for 5pm today.
i left work early to get home.
no one came.
guess i'm going to find someone else to do the work.
they said no so i left with wet hair and no cut.
i will never go back!
there was bone in my beef burrito.
i will not be back.
i'd rather grab some tacos in brookline than worry about losing a tooth.
worst service ever experienced in decades of eating out.
avoid bad server     all food not cooked.
try another be.
tons of good ones out there.
this ain't one.
but are they worth being discriminated for?
i say nay nay.
i am a nursing student, so i have to nave "natural looking" nails.
i will not be going back there ever.
there was not enough staff to handle the onslaught of customers.
add a soiled napkin, and you get my low review.
i saw the manager and i noted the lack of his service workers.
he said he had enough staff to handle the needs of his customer.
he said he would get back to me on pricing and installation date.
as there was still no response, i left a final message on dec 4th.
wow......possibly the worst restaurant in las vegas.
i didn't see one manager the entire hour plus that my group dined.
i will be telling everyone i know about this experience.
i thought guy fierri was supposed to be good at what he does.
ha. what a joke!!!
i've been coming to this location on and off.
the last time i came here was sometime last year.
not so sure it's worth coming back to this location.
these people could care less if you get your medication.
lady on the phone wouldn't listen at all.
would not call my existing pharmacy for rx transfer.
stupid, incompetent, uncaring, unprofessional.
who knows if i'll ever get my meds.
i need daily injections for a severe bone disorder.
don't go here if you don't have to.
save your time and go to target.
so i left, biggest waste of 40 mins of my life.
i had spent a good deal of money at this place, until last christmas.
clearly i'm not alone, as this page is littered with similar reviews.
avoid this place like the plague.
i would rather burn a $100 dollar bill than give this place just $1.
nastiest looking and smelling food i ever encountered.
my dog wouldn't even eat it.
never never again.
extremely disappointed with the service of this location.
an extreme disappointment.
my pasta was cold, bellinis are always watered down and service is crappy.
we're not just talking one time but repeatedly.
drive to another location trust me.
if it wasn't for the other locations i wouldn't be going back.
it's truly a shame.
what's all the hype about this place?
this place sucks, i just don't understand how this place stays in business?
it's pretty disgusting.
the cashier thought i should be serving him,
never even dream about going to this pathetic repair shop.
dishonest thugs are running it to loot innocent customers.
they will invent issues in the car to fleece poor customers.
the heavy oil liquified some char and colored the box.
the pizza itself was bland aswell.
"it was like eating a hot circle of garbage." - kevin malone, the office
the las vegas office doesn't answer the phone.
they do push extras, but somewhat meekly.
the transmission fluid plug fell out of my car.
i tried to call to ask whether i should do it, or return it.
this is not an accidental problem.
first timer at nandos resturant.
they forgot our drinks, they ran out of cups.
people, go to another location to get the right meal with drinks.
i do not support businesses that illegally stop women from breastfeeding in them.
this problem needs to be acknowledged and rectified immediately.
then the guy was indignant that y husband was not more greatful.
the owner blamed his part-time help.
if you go here, hold on to your ticket!
response to them have changed my mind.
if patricia really is someone in charge there, she should be ashamed.
every business on yelp gets bad reviews, all of them!
all the best.
my guest had scallops that were almost raw on the underside.
the service was quite slow.
needless to say i would not be returning.
i wish i'd read the reviews before i opened an account here.
jokes on me!
same shady fees, different bank.
i should've heeded the 2.5 star warning.
seems fairly reasonable to me....
apparently the keto substitution wasn't possible and the shit costs me $16.
for what i paid the amount of steak was definitely lacking.
going to egg works next time getting what i want, better quality, for less.
fyi i will delete this review but the owners should know.
and your men's bathroom is filthy.
take some pride in your business and clean things up.
horrible costumer service!
the way we were treated was completely unprofessional and immature.
we just wanted to buy one thing and got attitude for it.
honestly this place sucks over all.
lots of history.
but poor customer service.
my server was liliya last night.
i told her twice.
overpriced overpriced overpriced overpriced..
this place is ridiculously priced regular size = large ???
scam, scam, scam.
eventually got charged $26.
thank you, dakota, never ever again.
tiny portions and weird customer service.
this location has gone downhill in the past year.
the store is constantly dirty, poorly stocked, and understaffed.
everyday items such as milk and paper towels are often scarce.
looks fancy once you walk in.....
they didn't have one manicurist in the salon so i had to go elsewhere.
the service here is terrible.
horrible surly service and tough prime rib and top sirloin earns one star.
the hostess replied,"so do you want a beachfront view, too"?
so snarky and rude, and completely uncalled for.
if you don't like your job,keep it to yourself.
if i could give this place no stars i would.
the people working in the front are rude as hell.
idk  how this  place is still open.
i highly recommend not even coming here.
server was a bit grouchy.
had an early flight.
they were not open.
we asked when they openef and were told 6 am.
they were put off when we pointed out it was after 6.
then had to wait longer because our server was telling jokes with a coworker.
a different server pointed out she had people in her section.
breakfast omelet was fair at best.
this place is closed!!!!
tried calling and no answer so i drove up and they are closed.
this pub was disastrous....
the food was average, the beer was terrible, and the service was the worst.
came here for lunch.
ordered the gyros and it took a while to come.
obviously wasn't fresh.
fries were soggy as well.
wait a few minutes here comes my burrito which btw was just sitting there.
you try her on instagram...ridiculous!
serving me over priced and poor quality food and i don't get a refund?
worst service ever.
i also got a stomach after dining at this place.
i highly not recommend this place for anyone visiting las vegas.
nope this place is awful.
his name is lee, it was the owner!!!!!!
and he was even more rude when i went back to get his name!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
yuck this cookie is terrible and i love cookies so i'm not too picky.
very underwhelming experience all together - thus cookie is stale and bland.
if you ever feel the need to come in here, do not come alone.
don't do it!
waaaaaayyyy too pushy, lady.
this is so disappointing and should quite frankly be illegal!
don't ruin sheetz reputation with your minuscule sandwiches!
i expected more!!
this place is a complete hit and miss depending on when you visit.
i just finished throwing out a chicken wrap consisting of dry, inedible chicken scraps.
the soup was good, as usual, but the crappy wraps ruined the entire experience.
weekends are generally a bad time to visit.
called stonecreek talked with wade, tim and will, still awaiting call backs.
tamara has my number
overpriced meh food.
i think they just didn't want to honor it.
this place is like a wannabe hooters.
never book with this airline!!!
so never book with this airline!!!
i will continue to spread the word across all social platforms
if you're not going to be open until midnight, please don't advertise those hours
old, broken down rides and games.
games are all 2 tokens and most are very outdated or eat the tokens.
don't waste your money.
very uncomfortable feeling.
was wearing basketball shorts so didnt have a belt.
i shop there a lot.
but will definitely seek elsewhere from now on.
every time we come here, we have an awful experience.
the cold sandwiches say they come with mayo, mustard and italian dressing.
but both our sandwiches came with none of the above.
lacking mayo mustard, italian dressing and bell peppers.
nothing special at all.
place gets crowded with a douchebaggy crowd.
not a good experience for me, but it isn't a brunch place.
the atmosphere is dark and a little dingy.
the waitress was nice but not very helpful.
though we didn't try it, the baked smelled fresh and yummy.
so i am only reviewing brunch at yitz's: don't go for brunch.
i'm giving 1 star for the servers sense of humor.
maybe you might have a better experience then we did.
21% auto grat on preseason games?
waited over an hour at an airport for food.
shouldn't need much more reason for 1-star than that.
left $0.01 tip on an overpriced bill for average at best food.
we arrived in plenty of time for a sit down meal given our layover.
airport robbery, usually when i get fucked the other party pays for dinner.
it seems poorly managed by the (tweaker?) taylin who runs this location.
they are always out of something!
i was renting with ez rental car, which is a part of advantage.
we got there after a cancelled flight.
do not use them!!
so i can't get a courtesy cup while i'm playing??
i put $20 in and played the full 20.
then the clerk takes his sweet time getting a courtesy cup for me!!
no wonder this was the only places with open seating after the suns game.
when we got there we asked for a sampler platter to start.
i got the chicken cordon blue.
food came quick but there was a reason for this.
i'm a technician for another company, and have followed these 2 for months now.
customers, you pay  good money for your contracts.
pass the word..someone at first american has to finally see what they are doing
but the food is another.
bland, late, confused, and completely unremarkable.
my second and last visit.
one of the most unprofessional commercial companies i have ever dealt with.
front desk is very rude.
think i found out why.
the hostess confirmed that the room was available and happily booked our date.
he said that's right.
i told him to keep the room and we would go to mastro's.
he said ok - not even an apology!
absolutely no stars from me, actually!
i have to give them at least one star to post this review.
that was the worst massage i have ever had!
the lady that did my massage was grumpy and spoke very little english.
i will not go back and i will not recommend this place to anyone!
not my kind of business.
never order the below combo....they are made with same sauce & tastes same...
such a pathetic food we ever tasted...
bad customer service.
won't be back nor will recommend.
thank you itzel for the poor service.
terrible experience excessive amount of time to fix finder.
we purchased a home at the end of 2014 through homeowners financial group.
the experiences described by others here parallel ours.
however, once we found the home and were under contract, that drastically changed.
the staff were condescending in a most unprofessional manner.
screwed up another order.
why do i trust you guys?
i have to learn to stop coming here.
the food is what you get from a franchise pizza place.
the help is horrible.
the service is even worse.
they have little or no training and absolutely no people skills.
my experience at this location was far from satisfactory .
i will never return .
worst experience ever from this great place!
got major attitude!
where did the nice guys go?
no, no, and no!
yikes this show was terrible!
for some reason all of the men in the show looked flabby and nerdy!
ive never seen so many set changes in my life!
i would have preferred spending my money in the casino slots.
came into the location for a pickup order and wasn't even greeted.
the cashier was counting down her drawer and barely looked up at us.
will not go back.
i hope there was something less than a 1 star rating.
waste of money, stay out of it......!!!!
we spend $70 dlls.
again, stay out of it.......................
the one star is for the parts department they were very helpful.
one of the worst dining experience i ever had in a restaurant.
snobbish and rude!
below average food, terrible customer service.
never going back again.
been here several times, but tonight was a first for terrible experience.
arrived after 9pm, so there was no crowds or wait time.
order was taken quickly and the drinks/bread also quickly.
that's were the good service ends.
waiter only seemed concerned with chatting with friends at a nearby table.
at the fourty minute mark, i left.
beware beware beware!!!!!
normally i give fairly kind reviews but this place is awful!!!!!!
if you are diet conscious, eat here!
you'll have zero appetite after the first bite.
waitress extremely nice and decent atmosphere but the food truly is inedible!!!!!!!!
so we got into vegas and to our surprise no mustang!!!
hmm not good.
also costing me more money because last minute car rentals!!
and also taking about 3 hrs out of our time!!!
very disappointed in ace car rentals of las vegas!!!!!!!
the menu has changed.
i ordered the yucatan pork and a salad.
i thought it was joke at first.
at $28 they can not give you some rice or beans?
so plan to leave hungry.
ordered medium well, got brown on the outside and red inside.
once was enough for me.
this used to be one of the very best run mcdonald's hands down.
second time coming here in two weeks.
today was worst than the first time.
service is terrible.
it's hiring season, hire new staff!!!!!
the worst service, never ever come here.
we left with no cat whatsoever and the worst experience i've received anywhere.
the mushrooms that i ordered were terrible.
very expensive & not just for 1 person more like for about 10-12 people.
i also ordered the aloha chicken sandwich that was burned also.
my husband got a chicken salad that was huge & i do mean huge.
if u like salads u would definitely like this place.
the onion rings are very very spicy & terrible.
this is not what real bagels taste like.
seriously, i'd rather eat lender's from the grocery store.
at least they're not posing as fresh.
closed 5 minute before while we were at the door.
when asked that's it 5 min early.
we go by our clock....
i bet the owner doesn't know what going on here.
this place is the slowest fast food in the history of fast food.
but h did give me one napkin how sweet.
the food was super bad,  but the service made it even worse.
i had better expectations
no vents in the bathroom, showerhead sounded like a teapot.
wish i could give this location 0 stars!
walked in at 12:30 for lunch and stood in line after ordering.
only about 50% of the items were available.
i walked out and so did the guy behind me.
i'm normally a big fan of panda but will not return to this location.
read other comment i left.
food was not prepared as requested..
my last trip there,  for life.
i purchased a top and it fell apart while i was wearing it.
the beadwork literally fell off and i had it on less than an hour.
its cheaply made and poorly assembled.
never buy clothes at this place!!
very bad customer service.
i am never going back again i am better off shopping online.
be careful with michael at the venetian hotel registration.
this guy has no customer education skills .
if you are disabled make sure they never ask you whats your disability.
need to retrain workers on customer service.
michael is an asshole
they have baja sauce or spicy ranch or whatever it's called now.
i get it...it's taco bell.
but come on.
at least fake like you care about your job.
worst service ever!
no type of order here!
the guy in front running the establishment is rude!
they rudely talk about customers right in front of them.
just terrible service!
nancy threw my foot when i declined her offer for an "infiti pedicure".
i don't recommend this place at all.
dr mendoza is awesome.
i will be changing both my daughters from that office.
what then they aren't gonna take me that's some bullshit.
there is no such restaurant.
do not look for this non existent restaurant
it's been months since they installed my new roof.
on monday i get a call from them they are ready repair the damage.
big mistake they have now destroyed my patio awning.
now my awning is buckled up and i have a big dent in it.
sorry guy*recommendations1.
takeout salad - creative setting, okay good (3.5)2.
buffalo fries - mediocre, good vegetarian option.
i've eaten here twice and have gotten a stomach ache both times.
the food is not that great!
way better places in town.
this place is trash.
plus this waitress bitch with braces wouldn't quit spitting everytime she talked.
very bad service as well.
would not recommend at all to come to this t.g.i.f.
very poor management
since you can't leave zero ratings on yelp.
the manager was rude and dismissive.
i'd be surprise me if this location lasts.
this is a terrible, awful, downright extremely poor excuse for a delivery company.
any interested please message me.
awful, pretentious, horrible service.
they need to learn some manners and customer service skills.
not ever going back again!
i stick with cabell i've never had any problems with them...
in my book bass pro you got five thumbs down
worst service experience in my life.
three different cleaners for their company cancelled within 15 minutes of their scheduled times.
when we confronted him about what the website said, he just shook his head.
are you fucking kidding me?
if you don't have a product in stock, then don't advertise it!!!
terrible terrible service.
definitely going to another hair store in las vegas.
the place has a wonderful look inside but that is where the wonderful stops.
we had a group of 10 and service was terrible.
we were lucky to see the waiter 4 times the whole meal.
the menu is limited and at $25-35 a plate less than stellar.
the food was not good.
pastas was dry and not tasty.
no apology, no visit from the manager, nothing.
i would not recommend this place to anyone.
ordered the yin yang dessert with gluttonous balls.
wasn't strong and very cornstarchy.
milk pudding with mango wasn't strong in milk.
it's better at double ming found in the next  plaza.
overall not planning to come back!
personally i'd go to sugar marmalade or double ming
in other words this 7-eleven sucks.
the eggs benny is not good, hollandaise sauce has a weird tangy taste.
the eggs were way over cooked and asked to be made really soft.
don't waste your valuable time or money here.
do not purchase anything from living spaces!
we bought a mattress that destroyed my back!
i am 130 pounds never had back problems in my life!
wanted to return in the next day!
no return policy!
bye bye 1200$.
worst company i've ever purchased from.
can't believe they are still in business
i waited thirty minutes past my appointment time and still was not seen.
found the finger tip of a plastic glove in my burger.
i would never re-visit this spot.
dirty in my opinion.
he was nice but not the same.
this restaurant manager never took the call.
expensive and terrible service, but the food is delicious.
i remember dining here with my mom and brother, the server was so rude.
never dining here ever again.
do not call this cab co if you actually want to be picked up.
no apologies just rudeness.
i then ordered union cab online and they came.
makes me question what happened around my food that i didn't see.
seriously hope no one gets food poisoning.
pretty horrible buying experience.
thanks for nothing.
wow, yelp not just for food, i see.
this is contra bb policy (or at least was contra its then-existing policy).
pointed this out to him, but no.
this hard drive incident was at a different store.
very happy to take my dollars elsewhere.
i was being deployed for the military and canceled my membership so i thought.
i come back and there's a $400+ charge on my credit report.
i tried to talk to justine the billing lady.
she was very rude and not helpful at all.
i'm seeing a lot of other complaints on here for the same thing.
this place sucks!
me & my family walked in & saw 3 people working.
very poor customer service!
maids looked grumpy and tired.
brought us the bill (didn't ask) and brought us card machine (didn't ask).
ordered a simple salad that never came after 30 minutes.
stating because of big party.
i left and will never go back.
we just ate from denny's restaurant.
the order was not cook for i completely slept together.
everything tasted like crap.
that location should just shut their doors.
should've stayed home.
won't be coming back here again.
this restaurant is a complete mess.
i should have followed my instincts.
it's a bit worn and torn inside and not dirty.
i tried a regular size gyro and here is my report.
cost roughly $8.00 and it was not worth a penny.
the lamb meat was salty and greasy and i have been sick ever since.
avoid at at all cost
i won't be bringing anything back.
you can keep your needles.
they should have been making money on the volume of business, but damn..
i liked this place when i lived in the madison area.
didn't even answer the question.
really poor customer service.
rehearsal dinner being booked elsewhere.
had nigiri for lunch.
also it looked dull and unappetizing.
expect major delays and expect to get your food given to you incorrectly.
man at window does not have it together and is very rude.
i simply left pulled into the adjoining lot and took these pictures.
apparently this is what $24.99 will get you.
my kids could've done a better job than this.
definitely will not be returning.
way overpriced, for crappy bar food.
however the last time will be my last time.
i watched a cockroach crawl across the kitchen floor.
i do have a strong stomach.
this location is severely understaffed.
opening at 9 is also not great for anyone's schedules...
everyone here was waiting outside before the doors opened.
horrible customer experience, as if moving wasn't bad enough.
the girl needed some kfc,,,,,,,,,,,,,,lol we "needed" the new broasted product.
we ordered the 10 pc.
bucket meal,1/2 fried and 1/2 broasted.
( true story) .
not good unless you're starving and there's no chinese food within 10 miles!!!
brand new place, 1st visit, ordered 3 dinner items to go.
the good:  large portion size, prices a bit high but ok for location.
i might give this place a 2nd chance and try other options...
the ugly: go starving and love "buffet style flavored" chinese food or eat elsewhere!
this mcdonald's needs some serious help from customer service.
the manager melody should not be a manager but in the back peeling potatoes.
go thru it yourself and see what i'm talking about .
uh. just no...
entered this place and first impression was it was vacant and filthy.
glass on doors and windows was disgusting.
we likely avoided some sort of food borne illness.
food was overpriced for what it was.
service was almost nonexistent.
never coming back!
it usually feels a bit dirty.
the drinks, while priced well, are usually a bit weak.
i suggest moving up the block in either direction.
giving this place 1 star because i liked our server!
warm piscina sours  and cold appetizers!
the grilled octopus was tender but not grilled either!
tacos were crap and the arepas basket...well they were mediocre at best.
service was horrendous and drinks were gross.
we came for breakfast at 10 am their opening time.
they did not have masala for the dosa nor several other items.
two employees had just opened the place.
not professionally run place.
took half an hour to get the food.
the plain dosa by then was cold.
not a good experience altogether.
worst asian food in pittsburgh.
no idea how this has such a high rating.
literally everything we had was awful to the point that we left it.
i would not here if you paid me.
maybe you need to be from taiwan to understand why food is so bad.
this place straight sucks.
won't be returning.
i split a bbq ribs with my friend.
i have to say that it was the worst bbq ribs we've eaten.
the only good thing about it is the sauce.
bbq is too dry and hard it was awful to eat.
it looks like it was already pre made and recooked.
go to lucille's instead.
there was only one waitress and kept us waiting.
i'll never go back to this place.
loved the movie...
i felt sorry for the actors and singers who were outstandingly talented.
but all the 'high school teenage boy' penis & sex jokes?
puh-lease!!!'so disappointed.
but rock of ages at the venetian managed to do it with panache!
i'd probably give this taco bell negative stars if that was possible.
everyone knows taco bell serves shit food, but come on!
pretty sure my chalupa shouldn't be frozen.
that was a total disappointment!
it was way too hot and lines for food were ridiculous.
skimpy with giving you food you pay for.
got calamari and caesar salad.
no bacon, no parmesan cheese, hardly any dressing in the lettuce.
received my food and there's barely anything in there to eat.
way to go guys!
service wasn't great, couldn't seem to remember anything we asked for.
also, you shouldn't be able to bend chips without them breaking...
the worst management!
do not join!
they steal your money!!
i joined the central phoenix location before they closed.
i've tried several times to cancel my membership.
it's the same run around for the past 6 months!
terrible terrible place.
so now we're stuck with two separate keys for the house.
why didn't they keep the key number?
sloppy systems, plenty of arrogance and not recommended.
there was another gentleman walking around who also selected not to acknowledge me.
should have read the reviews.
server was apathetic and disengaged with our complaint when raised.
didn't even talk to us.
save your money folks and spend it somewhere they want your business.
we were sorely disappointed.
seriously you won't seat us if i am missing 2 people!!
we were even ordering immediately but apparently you have a pretty stupid rule.
poor customer service!
i will not be going back.
too bad, i like the food there.
it's still terrible.
my doctor is so mean, he doesn't have a heart.
i'd like to know what doctor did before mri's?
did they turn patients away like they do now?
place closes at 9pm weekdays.
went at 10 pmon a friday night and kitchen was closed.
i received the white platinum frames (2 sets).
the sizes were accurate but one of them had a visible crack.
my gripe is with the corner joins.
there is gap in some of corners.
if i had known this earlier, i would have made the frames myself.
i have done this before.
basically, they are not worth the money.
ordered something from wal-mart for my wife.
they often will not return any phone calls.
it takes several calls by different people to solve a problem within the complex.
finally, they are a total rip off!
my primary care referred me to this place for my injured wrist.
it was one of worst experience i have ever had with any care provider.
the doctor spent probably less than 5 minutes with me.
was excited to go here to try the ice cream sampler.
we made it at 10:15pm with a 11pm close time.
a very disappointing experience overall.
i felt like i was doing something wrong by reporting the incident.
they didn't even once ask how my boyfriend was feeling and was completely unsympathetic.
they didn't offer any help or comfort.
we went yo breakfast and came back, at 11 still waiting.
was told another 30 mins.
we left and got our money back.
stay away if you value your time.
i'd rather pay a bit more and go somewhere where you have an appt.
she informed us she didn't have any cutting utensils.
never will go back.
worst manicure i've ever gotten.
first and last time getting my nails done there.
waste of money.
we were brought someone else's food twice, trash service, trash food.
you're better off going to the food court.
two words - food poisoning.
despite the bad food and the subsequent digestive issues the servers tried their best.
will never be back.
super crappy service.
wouldn't honor their own advertised price.
and employee couldn't be bothered to go back and check.
after that we decided we have had enough and simply walked out.
i brought my 2014 ml350 in for service b.
i feel rather stupid for trusting this company to be fair with customers.
they said my script would cost $60.
i told them it should be $10.
they told me to call my insurance and figure it out.
i obviously went somewhere else.
i only got half of what i ordered.
the worst pharmacy ever to work with.
i know how the fill process works...
thank god i never worked here with any of these illiterate people.
i would give them a big fat  zero if i could!
the service (or lack of it) is beyond unacceptable!
if you hate your job then quit!
this is my 2nd bad experience & just had to leave a review.
probably the worst of the conveyor belt pizza chains.
this is no different.
it all looked good but had a sickening sweet sauce that nothing masked.
the breadstick were good but the sauce was pretty sweet again.
glad he had other food to offer his guests.
next time i'll get pizza hut.
this place is horrific!
the one star is only for the barista jenny.
dont go here.
i prefer the starbucks in the centennial plaza near walmart.
been coming here for years and frustrated every time.
the wait for any appointment or procedure takes at least 4 hours or more.
and when you ask about it, they are even ruder!!
i can't believe they treat people like this!!
still terrible service......still dissatisfied.
tried multiple times because tacos el gordo is quite the trek.
try smashburger, zupas or any other of the options nearby.
if you must have mexican, i suggest las cazuelas or don tortaco.
horrible, won't be returning.
the prices they charge are the same as premium sushi restaurants.
bland fried rice.
overcooked teriyaki chicken.
it's just a slop of chicken and onions.
this place is gross and waayyy overpriced even when using groupons!
i had to use them because they were about to expire.
this place makes my skin itchy.
i didn't enjoy anything during both visits.
i'm just being honest!!!
i'm just gonna stick to my fave thai restaurants krung siam and archi's(on rainbow/sunset).
i wonder how they treat regular guests at this place.
doctor was fine, but front desk staff are incredibly rude.
i'd rather drive an extra hour than go back to this place.
they said we had to wait an hour to get into the first club.
ordered online at 2:30 pm for pick up at 4:00 pm.
got to the place at 4:05 and my food was still not ready.
what's the point of ordering online if i still have to wait?
this is the worst place to go.
food was disgusting and cold.
don't ever go to this place!!!!
after releasing her she was back at the hospital with abdominal pain that night.
this time she agreed to the surgery but her biggest complaint was her stomach.
they discharged her and told her not to come back to the hospital.
she had a major block in her intestine which was causing pain.
mountain view didn't even check her stomach pain.
they just cleaned out her bank account and booted her out the door.
i will never come back here again
longest wait in the drive thru.
according to chevron's franchiser agreeement, this goes against the rules.
making way too much customer inconvenience.
i will complain to the top.
my husband was sitting on the bench with no table in front if him.
the entire place is so tiny and crowded ...
if evelyn wasn't at this location we would of stopped coming!
the people are rude up front.
i go to a different ewc now and they are phenomenal!
avoid this location at all cost!
never going there again.
our waitress never came to check on us.
had to flag someone else down for more sauce.
after spending 10 minutes in the drive thru, i leave here with nothing.
then to top it off, my drink was not made correctly.
i'll never come back to this one again.
looking for a dunkin donuts now.
what happened to this place?
the prices went up, the food got bad.
it was so bad the last 2 times i went here.
the fried rice was greasy and no flavor.
today they gave our daughter the wrong hamburger twice!
we had to ask for silverware and napkins.
the place is dirt, needs a face lift!
set up the move with a must deliver date of 8/21.
on 8/29, the car was still at the origin terminal.
they don't return calls.
they mostly ignore emails.
they just don't care.
called another shipper...car was picked up the same day as the call.
i want a full refund from das.
my family sadly will no longer be coming to this bakery.
i have ordered from them every holiday and no longer will.
their baked goods are delicious but their employees are extremely rude.
she of course was more rude on the phone.
the lady on the phone responded, "no!
come in right away!".
the price is reflective of the service, i guess.
had everything but the knife i wanted.
if you want some weird swords i guess come here.
also all there benchmade knives were way over priced.
i would go somewhere else.
our waitress was great, but it wasn't enough to save this review.
so disappointing and not worth it.
the staff and cleanliness on the other hand not so much.
this place was awful they made are experience so traumatic.
the employee including manager needed some retraining.
i'm sorry but i don't have anything good to say about this place.
we wasted 300+ $ here for nothing.
they said, don't worry.
few months later, i am being billed for the x-ray.
i contested it but nothing was done.
until they sent me to collections.
and mind you, this office never did any work just x-rays for consult.
i've had other dental office who never charged for x-rays.
be warned -- do not go to this dental office.
the food was bland.
would have been an option had the server ever stopped by.
the sushi rice i left was the size of a couple of tablespoons.
i was embarrassed and appalled and was not finished my dinner.
this happened after 10 minutes of eating.
so rude and unprofessional.
"so...are you depressed?" "no."  "are you sure???"
wow i don't know what was wrong with this visit...
taco y taco needs to cut down on the salt
lied about my order.
now, i'm afraid to order it & waste my time having them  fix it.
and i will not be back to this location.
not only was my order wrong but what they gave me was hella nasty.
i was given the munchie breakfast mashup which was totally disgusting.
i'll never go back to this location.
it will come cold and gross.
hey we actually think we are on the new candid camera.
asked for more water they brought us 1 glass to share     eeek
i wouldn't trust them to open a child's piggy bank.
got there before 5 minutes before minute clinic was to open.
was 4th in line.
this happens every time we have tried to use them.
nothing minute about this clinic.
they spend more time collecting insurance information than patient care.
don't eat here.
stupid overpriced for super ok food.
all other strip restaurants are a better choice.
worst manicure ever!
had two stylists paint my nails.
not coming back here unless they change it to be more like shwarma palace.
i wish i could give this place a higher rating.
the food is worth something more, however, the service is terrible.
i mean...absolutely terrible.
came in to get cleared in order to recieve my adhd medication.
im a 23 year old male in perfect health.
i was told it would cost upward of $500.
go anywhere but here.
they just want your money
when i order salad i understand some places water down dressing.
do yourself a favor and find a fat tuesday and do it big
food: so completely, totally meh.
pre-cooked meats, steamed vegetable, and poured over the top sauces.
decor: moderatly interesting asian art with a few too many happy buddhas.
service: confused but trying to be helpful.
our server was sweet but forgetful...won't be back and couldn't recommend coming here.
food tastes good here.
but be.careful, they charge you higher price than what were shown on the menu.
and they charge for steam rice?
everywhere else, the rice comes with dishes.
the price here is relatively high i would say.
it's possible, but what i'm 100% sure of is that they tasted revolting.
i don't just mean they were disappointing, i mean eating them was actually unpleasant.
i went to this place last saturday after reading all the great reviews.
i was greatly disappointed by this place.
220 dollar meal, and the entre was inedible.
i sent it back.
i came here to eat dinner, not go home hungry.
do not order the duck.
if i could write another bad review i would.
food never came after placing order for 45 mins.
the waitress said it is a computer issue, but it doesn't really matter why.
sure wasn't this hard to sign me up to take my money...
i ordered the chicken avocado wrap and side greens to go ($14).
the greens inside the wrap were wilted, soggy and brown.
the entire wrap fell apart after one bite; it was truly inedible!
friendly service, but unfortunately the food was inedible.
i will comment on the service not the food.
we were seated right away at 3pm.
the place is nearly empty.
we then ordered food and waited over 30 minutes for it to come out.
the waitress forgot our napkins.
let's see how long i'll have to wait for the requested check to come.
photo says it all.
they left my (and a neighbour's) package on the street for anyone to take.
called amazon to insist to not inflict ontrac on me anymore.
she was somewhat inattentive and there wasn't alot of people there.
the size if the bar was a nice size with pool tables.
however i will not be returning.
if you want to see a unique pizza place, this is it.
if you want good pizza, go someplace else!
george's gyro is cheaper!
falafel tastes like it was frozen.
hummus was flavorless.
the salad had too much cheap, salty feta.
this food is at par with food you'd find in the mall foodcourt.
they don't know what they're doing & the office is dirty!
i would not recommend this office to anyone!
went here for 7 years and hated the staff every single time.
i tolerated the rude, incompetent employees because i loved my dr so much.
my dr had since moved..
so that place can kiss my a**.
this is a dive bar.
i would not recommend this place to anyone.
it's just not my thing.
it's old and dark.
starbuck's is usually very inviting!!
afterall, there were 5 of us.
please teach some of ur employees about proper etiquette & hospitality!
afterall, isn't that it's all about?
being a successful business and all.
forgot the kids meal first time through drive through and had to drive back.
for the 30 people on staff the meal should have been perfect.
don't waste your money on this one.
i'd rather have wendy's.
ugh i hope they put a taco bell where this place is.
sat for 20 minutes --no service.
finally just left.
i fly out of calgary all the time.
this is the norm but i thought i would give it a shot again.
i have to say that the food was sub par.
i had the corned beef for breakfast.
the potatoes were so greasy and the cir ed beef was full of fat.
i am so disappointed.
there was also hair in my food.
i won't be going back any time soon.
i went because i was referred by somebody based off their ratings.
it was almost as if they were out to dinner having full on conversations.
i wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
i used to eat here quite often.
i have asthma and i am very sensitive to msg.
ordered dinner from grand italia at 7:00 pm using grub hub.
estimated delivery was 7:55-8:05.
the business practices of grand italia are ridiculous and  absolutely unbelievable.
expensive cafeteria style.
yuck great way to ruin french food.
went on taco tuesday and the food and the margs were disgusting.
will not be going back.
tacos were soggy and margs were tequila with water.
also we asked for the music to be turned down and we're ignored.
the service was good though
worst company ever.
do yourself a favor and don't use cox.
constant outages and poor customer service.
heard century is way better.
this place is horrible!
seriously, don't waste your money!
we threw almost a whole pizza away because we couldn't eat it.
i booked and paid for a vacation package on their website.
allegiant is the worst company in the world.
we ordered sashimi and was brought to our table by a server.
a customer from the other table took a few pieces of sashimi.
i know it was touched, i watched the other customer touch the food.
i've never been so grossed out.
you have been warned.
okay-just returned from lv and stayed at mandalay bay which was great.
the canter's deli we ate at was located in the sports book at md.
it was awful!
$25 out the window and lost appetite for rest of the day.
counter service sucked as well.
very rude manager and staff.
they shouted and behaved so unprofessionally.
couldn't believe someone can be that rude and unprofessional.
later i got to know that that manager is the owner and not employee.
beware they will forget half of your order with delivery !!!
he said that the driver was too busy.
i will never order from here again and suggest you don't either !!!
this location is incredibly unprofessional.
i've never had such bad service as i get at this panda express.
my recommendation is to take your money anywhere else.
don't go there to wash your car!
never going back !
poor service and dishonest waitresses.
i received someone else's order as well.
i called to report this but lost my receipt.
the manager defended the waitress, didn't apologize or offer anything.
worst service ever.
drive thru takes forever as well as going inside.
i have toured this facility a couple of times.
each time i tour they have a different price.
i recently thought "why not" give a shot.
called again to confirm prices and possibly enroll.
price changes again..
because of how dishonest they came off and the reviews.
elected not to move forward.
don't waste your time or money.
my items weren't ready when they said they'd be ready.
and at a different location!
plus the cleaning job itself wasn't good at all!
this torrid floors me.
horrible customer service every time.
like more than terrible.
we've gone 3 times thinking it will be better but it continues to disappoint.
will never be back.
we arrived around 910 pm for my birthday.
but we could order a pitcher of one of them?
came from out of town to go to whiskey row.
i am very disappointed and sad to say that i will not return.
that was very rude and unprofessional by him or the place.
never going there again!
this place looked like it was interesting dessert place.
unfortunately never got the opportunity to try it.
eventually walked out after about 20 mins, got tired of waiting.
i am a small business owner.
i hauled a load for this company back in november of 2015.
it is now march of 2016 and i have not been paid.
waitress had a smoke while we waited for drink refills.
manager (female) clueless.
me and my family wont return.
i ate here about a month ago and the service was lacking as well.
you will be out of business soon.
the hot water heater leaked sediment when you turned on the hot water.
i do not recommend this restaurant.
my husband and i both had a bison burger and we were both disappointed.
the only thing we ate that we liked was the bacon.
the service was good and the patio is very inviting.
ordered the spicy chicken benton.
not worth the price compared to other sushi places.
2 tiny pieces of tofu tempura and the chicken is mostly bean sprouts
if i could give this place no stars i would!
i mean how can u mess up pizza?
the desserts tasted like they have been sitting out for two days.
every one we tried was falling apart and dry.
the only thing that was good was the pineapple and the ice tea!
looks like they moved, closed or changed the hours.
posters and ads are gone from the glass windows and doors.
drove 26 miles to go there but not open on 10-29-15.
slowest "fast food" place i've ever been.
rude employees too.
this place is freakin terrible.
the food is okay, but the service is so bad i won't come back.
i wish i could give zero stars.
it was the worst puerto rican food i have ever had.
the chicharon tasted like salty old bricks.
the arroz con gandules was crunchy old and nasty.
i find the aestheticians have always been very helpful.
this place was literally 100 degrees inside and humid...
not coming back; at least not to that location ..
worst customer service ive seen in a long long time.terrible and rude staff.
cannot get the simplest orders right.
mixes up the breads.
plastic spoons and napkins missing from bag.
we are just glad to be done with this experience, we won't be returning.
it literally hurts to even go into one of these stores.
for some reason, this one in particular seems to have notoriously awful service.
ugh, you're cool, i get it!
if you have to buy something from here, i suggest just ordering it online.
actually, scratch that, go to target.
you can get the same things and they'll actually last.
that was at nine pm.
i am sitting here at 10 waiting for  the  police.
so the police finally arrive.
and resolve nothing  this is more like motel 6 and days inn.
since ther are many of them here  right now
i'm sorry this is a retail establishment not an emergency room/urgent care.
super long wait in driver through.
t minus 12 minutes and still no food!
it's transition time but seriously bfast to lunch is not that difficult.
not like you are chopping, cutting, and creating..
poorest environment ever****so my boyfriend asked me to hv korean bbq.....
the food was okay but don't expect to have a very nice environment there.
and apperantly the porkbelly came blue****
jc is so disappointing!
inside is small, dark and tables are crowded together.
food is mediocre.
best meal we've had was the philly cheesesteak; worst was the french toast.
unless he doesn't encounter one obstacle that fan is not going up.
store owner recommended electrician they normally use.
called owner said he would look into it.
call back said electrician told him he needed different type of screw....
owner rude and not customer oriented.
they called to schedule an appointment for a home warranty claim.
i called my home warranty and they had canceled my claim.
ridiculous- i'll replace my broken toilet myself.
i would never use these people.
**this review is for correct company.
they never called me back and i lost a day.
that's not how you run a business.
now i have another company coming out to fix my problem.
out of chicken for the fourth time.in a row.
they had 12 but said they were reserved for pickup in 20 mins.
guy tells me chicken will be ready in 15.
avoid at all costs!
i bought a bmw 745li on february 12th 2016.
they had worked on his car several times.
they will not help me or i think that they don't even care.
they have no concern no compassion for their customers.
all about the money!
worst walgreens in my 25years of being a customer.
this walgreens is what prompted my entire family to switch to another pharmacy.
i can't believe the level of incompetence in this store!!
front of the store is okay service, but avoid the pharmacy at all costs.
i went here with my friend and we did the all you can eat.
it cost us $50 and we both felt sick after.
my last review has thomas making a comment that i must be a competitor.
instead of trying to rectify a situation or improve customer service..they blame the customers.
.accuse them of being fake...or don't even respond.
your competition doesnt need to put fake posts on yelp.
party city in goodyear is a joke!!
they went as far as telling her they were going to call the police.
ok well if it's not necessary then don't accuse my daughter of stealing.
i won't be shopping there again!!
always make sure to scrutinize a resturant review from a college student.
it's more than likely based on the cost of beers rather than food quality.
his tone insinuated it was of the illicit sort.
it will never be a good review when a place gives you food poisoning.
went for late brunch on the sunday of a holiday weekend.
food wasn't great, but the after-effects were even worse.
i will never darken their doorway again!
closed at 7:38 pm.
incredibly misleading and wasted our time.
all they could say was that they were no longer serving.
i had got the $13.00 car wash with auto tire shine.
worst car wash ever!
i love this store and their great deals!
i knew living close to a b&bw was too good to be true.
they said, "our coupons on groupon are fake." they only accept coupons from retailmenot.
i've used coupons from groupon at this location and others before.
that was really bad customer service.
there was a line of 4 people and the employee was cleaning tables.
so he finished the table fine.
shockingly, he rings the cloth out and goes back to finish other tables.
i walked out and haven't been back.
wife and kids didnt like it.
disgusting crab, all of it.
cold, rubbery, and flavorless.
all the pasta was very salty, especially the asian noodles.
there was crunchy gristle in the chicken shu mai and mongolian beef.
the desserts were very sweet to the point of being flavorless.
go to harrah's champagne brunch, have the endless crab there, which is soooo delicious.
worst place ever greasy food employees drinking!!
waited 40 minutes for food dirty silverware and cups just not good at all!!!
these guys are liars or they're not very good mechanics.
had a smoke test done to identify a problem.
my boyfriend warned me against this place and i should have listened.
they are lazy crooks.
do not bring your car here.
you will regret it.
$11  for a small bowl which was quarter full (burrito bowl).
i got the burrito bowl with the thai flavor sauce and chicken.
walked in after traveling on a plane.
they sat us down at a table, brought us plates.
my wife and i tried to get someone's attention no luck.
no one even noticed us leaving or stopped us.
i've never done that before but felt after being ignored we had no choice!
i have had not one pleasant experience this company.
the  drivers are unprofessional.
most of the cars are filthy.
my dr now absolutely sucked.
she was incompetent and unprofessional.
i will never go to this doctor's office again.
here's what really made me mad about this restaurant.
it wasn't the extreme price for the less than average steak.
do us both a favor and avoid this place.
the doctor was so rude to my 14 year old.
he just lectured her about wearing protective gear and insinuated she wasn't sensible.
this guy should not be allowed to work with children.
my daughter left so upset.
i didn't say anything and i feel terrible for not having done so.
the location is beautiful!!
my husband and i went to dinner last night and everything was going well.
our server was super nice.
we saw the whole thing go down and the bartender is in the wrong.
she was mean!
my husband and i were shocked how horrible she was treating customers.
it ruined our night and we will not be coming back here.
i think it was very bad service and overpriced food.
i would have to say i wont go back here again.
i wont waste my time or money going back here.
my wife was in severe pain this morning.
the wait was lengthy...
nurses did not respond to her at all.
go else ware if you need care and are in pain.
worst company ever to rent a car from!!
they don't even deserve a zero!!!
this place is a mess!
hasn't the car wash business realized that they were charging themselves out of business.
another time it left soap all over the back of the car.
the prior ownership was my favorite spot to go and clean my car.
stay away from this debacle and shop for a decent wash!
my mom had stopped to pick up dinner.
service and portions get poorer and poorer every time.
i'll continue recreating my own version of grilled cheese meets reuben at home.
sunglasses were stolen out of the glovebox.
still no sunglasses.
avoid full circle car wash at all costs!!!
the associate at the counter was rude and unprofessional.
i will never use budget car rentals again.
horrible customer service.
they didn't compensate or anything.
no manager was on duty and the response was very bad and unprofessional.
they have forgotten parts of my order another time.
i'm done with this place.
very very poor service.
check your order before you leave.
we ordered sweet & sour with sauce on the side.
they forgot the sauce.
when i picked up, i asked but did not check.
they nodded yes.
i think they are just too busy to care.
they offered to drop off the sauce at the house.
this took two hours.
our meal was soggy by then.
roar boom fireballs wow wow - this is how we kill recruiters wet dream.
sorry, but all of these multimillion dollar death machines creep me out.
d-termination would not adjust as they said they sprayed the outside too.
the outside of a building with four units??
i didn't order that but i have to pay for it??
i do not recommend nor will i ever use them in the future.
completely ignored for 10 minutes.
literally workers walking past us, chatting with each other, ignoring us.
i thought it was a joke
not a "sorry" or anything.
needless to say, i'm going to a better car wash now.
they don't accept arby's gift cards.
shame on them!
they have since closed their doors for good at this location.
i don't get heather d.
an omelette, hash browns and an english muffin?
anyone can make that at home.
el chorro is an overpriced mediocre place.
you can't eat views.
tonight was our second time ordering from humble pie.
our order tonight was such a disappointment.
don't do it.
we have tried this place a few times but it's bad.
the crust is never baked all the way through as well.
over all bad.
never going back
do not get this insurance.
i purchased a new car that needed full coverage.
well, prime it is not.
service was very slow and inattentive.
had the beef tartare and it was quite good.
then waited 40 mins to get my scallops and rissotto!
when it came, rissotto was so undercooked, it was crunchy.
i think over those 40 mins they could have at least cooked the arborio!
for the high price point, this restaurant completely over-promises and under-delivers.
dismissive sales associate lost a good sales opportunity due to her attitude.
never go this place.
they probably will charge your card many times "by mistake".
went there one night, and my card was charged for the correct amount.
if i could i'd give it a -1 star!
sat there for an hour went to have a tooth extracted.
his response was what questions its self explanatory.
very unprofessional dentist.
do not go here!!
the front desk staff is not friendly or helpful and are very unwelcoming!
decent esso compared to other gas stations in the area.
so when the temperature is around freezing or below, the windshield service is useless!
the rest of the pumps are set to pre-paid between 10pm & 6am!
don't put your uber pick up outside of nevada.
just because your hotel is in cahoots with the taxi service, that's called racketeering.
worst hash browns i ever had.
meanwhile my food was sitting on the counter getting colder and colder.
the hollandaise sauce on my bears benedict was an extremely dark color, almost brown.
last time i ever visit that diner.
i was not aware of a $200 deposit and needed insurance.
i will never do this again or rent from your company.
went for lunch today and ordered kung pao chicken.
possibly the worst i have ever had.
no taste, too much celery, and in a brownish sauce.
fried rice and hot n sour soup were ok.
won't do this again.
used to be my fav all you can eat sushi place.
not any more.
wasn't busy lunch dinner time but rice in sushi was literally warm.
all sushi was pretty much the same on taste.
difficult to eat,  some of them not properly rolled.
dinner wasn't worth it the money.
i am actually writing this while waiting in line.
this place is a joke.
warning do not join this gym!!
i joined smart gym in scottsdale.
the gym closed down and now i keep getting charged monthly membership dues.
smart gym scottsdale closed its doors without any notice to its customers.
and now they are continuing to charge customers.
i regret doing any business with smart gym.
we were told that this is a conservative restaurant.
i guess that means you can't laugh and enjoy yourself at this restaurant.
we have been at a sports tournament all day with no alcohol.
we were all highly offended.
i don't recommend this restaurant at all.
phil sucks as a manager.
we went at lunchtime on a sunday.
it only came out after i complained.
i was told there was one chef and they were very busy.
it does not take a chef to cook restaurant supply store pasta and sauce.
someone forgot about our order!
it came out cold about 2 minutes later.
i weir this now bcuz it's exactly a year today.
by the way, it was ronnie who was so rude!
mirage used to be the best.
had great prices, friendly staff, and always did a great job.
now under new management, it is the absolute worst.
they rush through everything they are doing, and never do a good job anymore.
today, they messed up my eyebrows and refused to admit that they were uneven.
done with the new management && i guess now i'm done with mirage nails.
i called to schedule my 17 month old daughter's first dental appointment.
http://www.aapd.org/media/policies_guidelines/p_fluorideuse.pdfhttp://www.aapd.org/media/policies_guidelines/bp_periodicity.pdfhttp://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/134/6/1224
horribly rude and really no excuse for it.
picking up our car tomorrow and after seeing these reviews i am really nervous.
we booked through hotwire so no backing out.
bad bad bad service bad people racist took my jewelry it is worth 10,000dollars
i was born and raised in chicago, so i know real chicago food.
the burger tasted like $1 burger from burger king with liquid velveeta cheese.
the pizza puff was okay but a bit greasy inside.
maybe i should've tried the beef!
when he finally came to take our order he had an attitude.
bad business...will be my last time here.
too bad because the owners are really nice.
been shopping here exclusively for 7 years.
they recently took out the self checkout and now it's a nightmare.
a quick trip in and out no longer exists.
time to give the fry's across the street another chance.
you never realize how good you had it until it's gone.
i get packages frequently that don't even have my address on them.
have some damn pride in your job.
disappointed with the food and had to send my dish back.
the chicken in my salad tasted like it was spoiled.
no apologies, and was charged full price.
service was slow and it was not very busy.
won't be back.
was looking forward to visiting this restaurant.
i would not recommend it.
totally understaffed .
$17.00 for a shot of patron on the rocks is dishonest at best.
it's just ugly.
ok airport rent or fees, etc.
but ugly is ugly.
not even worth on groupon.
the meat is the lowest grade known to men!
salad bar is poor.
caipirinha was expensive and aweful!
spend your dollar at texas de brazil which will be much better investment.
giving this place a 1 star only because i can't choose 0 stars!
what i received was crap.
besides the horrible food the price was way too over priced.
i literally just shit my $29 dollars out.
i would definitely not recommend.
had an appointment scheduled with brad.
he was a no call, no show.
waited for 2 hours.
left a message to see if i had somehow had the day wrong.
no return phone call for that either.
service: was very rushed.
it felt like i was in a 5k run water station.
food: was bland, without flavor and downright boring.
we had he banana bread french toast and the denver wrap.
the orange slice tasted like day old fish.
other than that disgusting act, the restaurant appeared to be clean.
- because this place isn't open.
it's saturday 12:45, gave it about 15 mins to see if someone showed up.
i'm totally wasting my time.
hours of operation clearly say saturday 10:00 am to 9:00 pm.
god forbid maybe an emergency happened.
comparable to the worst pizza you'd find in ny.
and you can't get a fountain water on top of it all.
this place is a dump.
i went there to buy several pairs of dress pants and shirts.
it looked like nobody had worked there for days.
there was clothing, hangars and trash everywhere.
the dressing rooms were filled with piles of tried on shirts and pants.
the inventory selection was dismal.
also, there was not an employee in sight for help.
have had two really bad experiences.
yesterday wanted to try shoes on 2 year old.
they wanted to charge us $10 fitting fee.
these were tap shoes, not pointe!
three sales people and we were only customer.
extremely bad customer service.
tried ups store to ship some items.
i needed items boxed up and shipped.
clerk did not give any options like 2 day shipping or overnight.
i felt like it was a great inconvenience to the clerk.
another shipping store in town helped me with out question.
not going to ups again.
old mcdonalds manager...my last visit, i tried.
so update on this.
extremely unprofessional and i will never step foot into this place ever again.
came on nuit blanche night.
if you do not get a waitress who simply does not care.
the food were simple dishes, but they were done well.
when the bill came, all my questions were answered.
if you do eat here, pray you have a better waiter/waitress.
do not go here for thai food!
restaurant is dark and stuffy.
got the seafood pad thai for lunch.
it was quick since there were 2 customers at the restaurant.
staff was friendly.
unfortunately most of it was uneaten since the flavour was lacking big time.
poor customer service from the service department today.
was told to come in and the reset would take about ten minutes.
class schedules are not created and posted on time.
what is the point of a "jump-in" class that you can't jump into??
what ever happened to service?
ordered pizza for delivery and was told an hour to hour 15.
over 90 minutes and still no pizza.
last order they messed up the toppings.
pizza is quality is  hit or miss.
but now it seems the business is closed.
no notes, no info, no returns calls or emails.
in researching what happened to the owner/instructor i discovered he now resides in alaska.
not cool, anthony.
now he's at home limping and we have to give him anti inflammatory medication.
i ordered take out from here one evening.
nothing like i had expected.
i will never order or eat from there again.
a terrible experience overall.
i think i'll use another company from now on.
the only one that is affected is the homeowner ...
my family (3 kids) and animals are the ones paying the price.
hope you sleep good in your air conditioned home!
do walk run!!!
run away very very fast!!!!!
thai shan inn is out of touch.
my friend's dog is having complications from dental surgery- that this clinic performed.
shame on them.
edwin the "operations manager" is extremely rude and unhelpful.
budget just lost another long time customer over a very small, fixable issue.
budget should replace him immediately, or they will continue to loose more customers.
i told him to trim my son's hair and not to cut too short.
i wouldn't recommend coming to this location.
another customer told me that they seem to employ substandard hair specialists...
has not been a fun experience.
the pool cleaner was cleaning the neighbors yard for about 3 weeks.
when they finally started cleaning my pool, the job was incomplete **see photo.
i ordered fettucinu alfredo as delivery, and it has no seafood in it.
shittiest experience on just eat ever!!!
charter is quite possibly run by the devil.
i can't say for certain it is, but i'm fairly sure.
a freaking pharmacy and the closest one to you.
i ended up going to the grocery store, fry's and got the medicine there.
i will never go to a cvs pharmacy.
i got a pedicure here.
and when she came back to finish my feet my water was cold!
and then my gel chipped in a week!
i order the #24 a bacon, egg, ham croissant combo with orange juice.
i left a message for management but have yet to hear back from them.
needless to say my morning is off and my stomach aches now.
they are jeopardizing my ability to make an income to pay my existing mortgage.
they treat sales like hard core collections.
ordered a pepe cause i love ham.
but they put turkey instead.
i'll give a star for the extra mayo tho.
took away the taste of turkey.
only because i have to give a star.
overpriced food for the quality.
should be priced more like a texas roadhouse for what you get.
wanted a great experience.
recently i have been very disappointed with this denny's service.
brave the winds and sail seas, farewell fellow seafarers.
if they don't like working with the patients their not shouldn't be there.
this place is awful!
my husband and i had just moved to the area.
the lady behind the desk was very unfriendly and unprofessional.
the comforter was ruined!
i would advise staying away from this cleaners.
you're better off not getting your nails done at all than coming here!!
they are extremely unprofessional.
i left with smudges on my toenail polish and in a bandaid.
i used order from this place all the time.
like 2-3 times a week.
they had their kid answer and i placed the order with him.
" there's no money here".
wtf dose that even mean!!!
if you're gonna be in this country learn to speak correct english!!
they lost me as a customer and will never order from this place again!!!
i wish it were possible to give 0 stars.
i got upsold to doing the hd brows (tint + wax + brow make-up).
forget the fact that the right brow was completely fine after.
the only credit goes to the cook who made a pretty good pancake.
not worth the drive across town.
cold prime rib served with moldy butter that isn't dated.
i asked for extra sour cream & got moldy butter!!!
horrible setup, no employees available to help.
1 register open per floor.
20 minute wait to purchase.
cutting up jcp card.
the warranty is for 12 yrs., parts-labor.
this was stated in the newspaper,the sales person and the contract.
now that 2 years have gone by the co.
if you are shopping for an a.c., i would think twice about this co.
your employees should be on time.
today thurs 6/16 i was waiting outside at 955.
had to knock girl was extremely spacey .
couple of years ago we took one of our dogs here for grooming.
it's funny how you "quoted" me...
shame on you!
we definitely regret having sunk the money into this lorex system.
:(like soooo many other reviewers have said.....
crap support, total time wasting if you ever have an issue and even then....
no answers to help.
how this company continues to sell their stuff is incredible.
well look at that.
i was right.
worst wendy's in the city i would say!!
i once waited in the drive thru for 20 minutes here.....
moral of the story, don't go here
horrible customer service and miserable workers.
this place needs new management.
she sounded a little upset when i told her i already bought the groupon.
(groupon price was $30) i told my manicurist i wanted white tips.
this entre alone was $120.00.
it only barely fed one person.
all skull and bones.
do not order this, it is a total major rip off.
i'm guessing $300 for three people.
the rest of the meal was minimal and left us hungry.
had to go to place in the food court nearby later for a snack.
spend the extra $15 and use a different company.
my flight was one hour.
the time to get my car with budget: 1 hour and 30 minutes.
long line with three check in stations unmanned.
i was turned away twice for scheduled appointments.
neither a well appointment, both sick patient appointments.
again, they blamed the web site people.
this just solidified it for me...
their customer service is just the worst!
thank god we were home and caught it early, otherwise, we would've been screwed.
this place is horrible, i've never had an experience like this ever.
please choose another place to rent from!
cute store very helpful girl but all they had was xs which im not.
everything i wanted was online :(
seriously, the worst.
customer service here sucks.
we'll never buy a car here again.
steakhouse without steaks ?
service: nonefood quality: no foodgood for: nothing
i think they should call this the no service airline.
no one seems to be focused on customers and their needs.
it was horrible!
proved for a messy and unsatisfying eating experience.
also, service was slow and unattentive, but the ambience was great!
(it'll definitely need the extra flavor).
do not rent a car from these scammers!
they are cheap for a reason!
spread the word-no shop!
always charging for unnecessary rests.
can't just get shots has to do.this and that test.
i have spent the last 600 bucks here.
please leave ft mill.
i wanted to die, no joke.
the fried rice was so bland, panda is even better.
he's extremely rude, loud and obnoxious.
worst experience ever .
old rooms & smelly .
i don't recommend it .
today they reached the limit , i ordered a veggie hummus sandwich bagel to-go.
and guess what,  i see there is absolutely no hummus in my sandwich !!
wanted to give it zero stars but can't on this review board.
food is absolute crap, disgusting.
i wish i could give this location zero stars.
it's rare to find an employee who is polite and willing to help.
every time i ask someone a question they seem annoyed.
i scheduled the move from the pittsburgh area to western wy.
they showed up to pick up my load on the day promised.
the move was contracted to be delivered by july 31, 2018.
still living without my stuff a month later.
customer service has no recourse to help.
general manager jim messmer cannot help.
what a nightmare!
my wife ordered the chicken and mac & cheese, which was satisfactory.
i would have given this a four-star review.
i know that the customer is not always right, but chef...
neither are you.
we will not be returning.
i hate giving bad reviews but this place will get one.
food is mediocre at best and the service was terribly slow.
i had to ask 3 different servers for water and extra plates/bowls.
it was like pulling out teeth.
i won't go into how long we waited for food.
it wasn't a pleasant time.
overpriced, low quality ingredients.
an insult to burritos everywhere.
portions are extremely small.
maybe their catering is ok, but their retail frozen pre-prepared foods are terrible.
worse than the wildly inconsistent and incorrect directions is the end product.
especially given the price!
i have no problem paying more for quality prepared foods.
i've tried this place twice and it's a huge disappointment.
won't be a third time.
new management, same disappointment.
i'm not sure what brought me to come back to this place.
maybe the new "jackson's" name seemed promising.
i can assure you, nothing has changed except the name on their shirts.
do yourself a favor; take your money elsewhere.
nothing says midlife crisis like this here joint.
it just reeks with stale testosterone.
the cook looked like he just chuckled and walked in the back.
we walked out behind him.
this place is shady as.fuck.
they tried to.over charge on bottles and some stripper hoes falsely advertised their price.
the girls here are nothing special.
vegas is way better.
im fat and ugly but still not impressed .
avoid these shaddy aholes
my husband and i went to uno's for dinner last night.
we sat and waited over 20 minutes and no one stopped at our table.
there were other tables seated after us, which were promptly greeted by servers.
unfortunately,  the host was too busy chatting with a server to really care.
i posted this on urbanspoon as well:i hope this helps.
everything is out of a box and/or frozen, dethawed and placed in a mircrowave.
doner is suppose to be cut thin, full of flavour and specific spices.
this was frozen, hard to chew and cuts of fat all over the place.
save yourself some money, go somewhere else.
was this review helpful?
yes | no
i would give them 0 stars if i could.
please do not go here if you're expecting a pleasant experience.
went for the first time last night, and let me tell you not impressed.
they had a special event there staff could apparently not handle.
waited over an hour for a chicken sandwich!
also was burnt and dry by the time it arrived.
will never go back!
i dont think im coming back to this location.
not worth it for $26
why would you put a patient in a supply room?
horrible experience for my kids and i.
if this place is around in a month i'll be surprised.
i repeat, do not go here for brunch.
you will be disappointed.
was served dirty mushrooms and gotta hair in my fries!
the most expensive and least competent gas station i've ever encountered.
$.10-$.15 more expensive than other gas stations in the neighborhood.
can't even manage the basic function of providing gas.
pumps shut off mid-pumping.
complete waste of time.
absolutely the worst drive thru service in the morning.
this is all a result of bad management.
they either need to staff better or remove drive-through services.
my beautiful dog, who was only 5 years passed away in my arms.
all they did was say sorry.
stay away find a vet that actually takes time with each pet.
doesn't try to push them to like some kind of assembly line.
it will certainly be much later.
also, dont bother making an appointment because they don't honor your time.
this is the most disgusting hotel ever.
only plus, no signs of bed bugs.
a homeless shelter is cleaner than this hotel.
the barback jase or chase or whatever his name is ruined my experience here.
the guy is young and in hi early 20s.
turned me off to ever going back there.
i had a bad experience with this company.
when we returned the vehicle, we were charged $83.00 extra for fuel and service!
we had returned the tank 3/4 full.
no idea where this 83 dollar charge came from.
have had much better experiences with other rental companies.
dont waste your money here.
she was rude, abrupt, not attentive the entire time.
just terrible experience overall.
my all time favorite airline has reached an all time low.
meanwhile, call center hold times are nearly an hour today.
fly another airline, take the train, drive, walk ...
or just stay home.
no vacation is worth the amount of stress, anguish and hassle we've been through.
not the kind of food you expect for these prices or for this location.
she is  active duty, so she inquired about the free burger.
well after 20 min of waiting on drinks..
offered to pay the dollar difference but no dice.
avoid this place!
took 15 minutes to place food order.
28 minutes to get the food.
restaurant only about 25% full.
which is unfortunate for him since i usually tip very well.
worst food experience i've ever had in las vegas.
i normally do not leave reviews but holy crap.
and she waxed them so thin wayyyy to thin.
and on top of all this she got wax in my hair.
and was just so aggressive and not friendly at all.
i came here and there was nobody there but myself.
the cashier bret was very unfriendly.
he did not ask if it was for here or to go.
it was packed to go and i was eating there.
had to ask for receipt cause he did not give me one.
how can i eat corn and mashed potatoes without a fork.
had to ask for one.
now i see why they have a very low rating.
the food was ok.
i went for wings.
the directions will place you on the opposite side of the street.
the wings though fried well and crispy had absolutely no taste.
not even any msg...i'd have rather eaten cardboard.
i certainly will not be visiting ever again.
terrible overall experience.
to top it of, the service was terrible as well.
we made a bad choice.
should have waited for easy rider.
was a member here for about 3.5 years.
my contract was only 12 months but continued to use the gym.
we cancelled when we switched our billing and they did not accept amex.
the gym was purchased out of bankruptcy and there was always issues.
they seem desperate for money now.
extremely unprofessional and lazy!
avoid this place like your told to avoid carbs, sugar and sodium.
set up an appointment for a physical at 11:20.
arrived 10 minutes early.
2 hours spent waiting and still haven't been called.
this place is a joke.
minus the tvs which are great for watching sports, the food almost killed me!
yep i'm not ever going back there again..
went in to get a refill on a prescription for nerve damage.
the receptionist told me they could when i called to check first.
i'm currently unemployed and now our $150 for a screen over.
thanks for nothing!
i won't be back.
discussing food and discussing service.
go to another place in the airport for food.
dirty stinky and discussing food.
is this place still in existence?
looked for it, can't find it...no signs...no body answers tbe phone.
i like some of your stuff in the pics...but...oh well.
ok so i found the place, wish i hadn't!
no sign on the building which is why i couldn't find it.
this place is a joke!
furniture crammed in,  can't sit on any of it because it so cramped.
i left.....i'll look elsewhere
after poker i was hungry so i figured i'd try this place.
the plate came quickly and had a big fat shrimp on it.
being deathly allergic to shrimp i waved my server over and explained.
are you kidding me?
and is it ever really a good idea to scold a paying customer?
especially on their first time?
and now i have to tip on top of it, right?
i have 3 daughters and another on the way.
i told them to stop calling and they never did.
they physicians were ok but not great.
i hate everything about this place!
absolutely the worst run company i have ever come across!!!
i wish i could give negative stars.
please find any other company to get services from!!
service staff were not attentive.
location is good for theatre- and film-goers.
but food is definitely over-priced.
this place is so over priced for the small portions they provide.
the roti was  small with mainly potatoes and very little meat.
and talk about salty, .
curry chicken dinner was the same thing.
salty food with very dry rice and little meat..
terrible service and flavourless.
this is the second location that i've had a really awful experience with.
pizza delivery took 2 hours.
took another hour to correct and send out.
pizza had no cheese.
this location is the ultimate failure.
what a waste of money.
$16 for a dozen oysters, and you would expect high quality decent size bi-valves.
pearlz charges that and they are worth it.
btw pearlz sells them for $10 dz on mondays.
so save your bucks.
they passed the small cling-ons as i call them, as an oyster.
you know, the itsy bitsy ones that attach to the larger oyster.
shore club: those are called freebies!
if i could give this trash ass place a 0 i would do it.
all them dumbass hoes would like this overhyped shit.
i would never come back to this place ever again.
the bread sucks cock.
1 egg per sandwich for a place called eggslut?
lmfao is that a joke?
the food went into the trash and we will not be back.
place is dirty smells staff are rude.
placed a phone order walked in and was shocked by how it looked inside.
i started to walk off and was asked if i needed something?
i said "no not now.
i hung up and they called back i refused to answer the phone.
horrible, discourteous owner and inept service people.
no way would i ever recommend this place.
very, very bad.
dinner at border grill was so incredibly bad.
i am not a woman of the most discerning taste.
i love a good sloppy enchilada so i'm not a refined foodie.
this was our first and last time attending the annual arizona taco festival!
once inside the reload stations were longer than most of the taco lines.
poor poor planning!
one star rating was the least i could give.
too bad you cannot grant a negative star.
unfortunately, after seeing a fantastic uncomparable show "o" by cirque du soleil.
i was extremely disappointed by "love".
if you are a beatles fan, i would recommend.
yet, although my family and i are also fans, i didn't appreciate it.
sorry, just saying.
they forgot my french fries....
communications were then immediately halted with no intentions of future encounters...
this post office sucks balls.
first of all, they don't open til 8:30am!
and even though i got there at 8:15 -_- there was already a line!!
it really sucked.
avoid this place like fungus on nails.
there are many things wrong with this establishment.
husband called for towing at 10:45am and they said they were coming out.
at 1pm, called them and they said they couldn't send someone.
waited 3 hours for nothing in the hot vegas sun!!!
called american towing and came within 30 minutes.
do not use ewing brothers!!!
tantamount to fraud (alert)deceptive business practiceavoid this place!
"fresh atlantic salmon." what does that mean to you?
they did not have a senior discount, either and i declined their $2.99 drink.
this is not the old battista's!!!
it is now owned by cesar's.
i always looked forward to eating there when the nfr was in town.
now it is overpriced pasta.
i could not get a pizza or any of the old good stuff.
:(     vastly disappointed.
i agree with most of the responses.
all of the other companies had no lines and people breezed through.
these guys are not easy to deal with.
scheduling is hard.
getting them to show up on time after its scheduled has proven problematic.
i am shocked this company is still in business.
management is almost nonexistent.
our community decided to increase service only to get much less.
error after error- no follow up unless reminded.
i've gotten molly's in the past and it was pretty good.
however, i ordered it tonight and never received my food.
no apology was offered.
i have now been sitting her for another hour!
it's a good thing i had some chicken defrosting.
food not all that good.
i won't bother with the specifics because pretty much everything was wrong.
i wish i could say it was just the staff that was rude.
but it was also the food.
steak was undercooked and so was chicken.
mashed potatoes were crusty?
how's that even possible.
and then to top it off we had trouble with the bill.
the manager was friendly and apologized.
look elsewhere before settling on this resturant.
i will never be back!
manny's ac is not.
now my roof is leaking where he installed my unit.
he is a horrible contractor/person.
i have never meet a person like him very dishonest business person.
i would never recommend him to anyone.
after traveling from memphis to vegas we decided to grab a bite to eat.
there was two other customers in the restaurant.
it was 3am!!
needless to say we left and went to denny's the next exit down.
i've never known a restaurant to turn down business.
i wish i could give them zero stars.
in general, this taco bell has some pretty inconsiderate customer service.
the lady that answers the phone is rude.
and btw, they no longer accept spay/neuter pet vouchers.
maybe it's a blessing in disguise, i suppose.
be careful of constant attempts to add fees on to the pool and design.
they tried to bill us additional 1500 for a hard dig.
after i challenged them, they decicded it could be excavated for the original price.
nothing larger than a softball size rock or any caliche in the back yard.
the service is also very poor as some of the others have noted below.
got bed bugs in room 242 or 250 !
free internet in lobby only...really - hilton get a clue!
fidelli is seriously gross.
all of the food is frozen.
nothing is fresh.
the owner is rude,(he wears earbuds in his restaurant).
rudei seriously miss the wine expert.
if you want frozen foodgo to your supermarket not fidelli
i was given a referral by my neurologist to see dr. hott.
the service was terrible and the food even worst.
all the dishes look exactly alike.
i ordered chichen piccata and it was anything but that.
it took over a hour for the dinner to come out.
part of the dish was hot and other cold.
there were only 5 tables of people in the whole place.
i will not be going back there.
so i ordered #7 with no mustard or ketchup extra mayo.
when i get my burger it gots extra mustard extra ketchup...
bummer never eating there again
the food is good, but i can't say it's safe though.
i don't like their sandwiches at all.
the bread is really hard and cuts your mouth, like its old!
the portions are small and the prices are quite high for what you get..
sometimes, it'll arm, sometimes it won't.
however, the bigger issue is the lack of support from the company.
i can go days without hearing back from them.
we ended up leaving and going back to adt.
by far the worst experience ever!!
one person working the counter and window.
one person cooking.
this at 12:30 in the afternoon on saturday.
by the time i got my food and got it home it was cold.
the chinese food was so white washed since it opened.
very disappointed will be finding a new doctor.
went to brunch today and thought the good was very mediocre.
had grits and shrimp.
the shrimp were baby shrimp over mushy grits.
very tasteless nothing served with the dish.
i would not go back.
very expensive for what you get.
the menu is very small.
this is the most incompetent clinic i have ever dealt with.
the staff just kept transferring from one voicemail to another.
definitely looking for another clinic for future visits.
scary that this is how they track their patients
i have no clue how they make money.
over two months and no product.
instead of a teddy bear face that i requested she has the complete opposite.
she has had bad hair cuts before but never ever something this bad.
won't be coming back and don't suggest spending your money here.
she looks ten times worse than when i found her in the shelter.
then top it with hollandaise from a can.
so turned off, will not be back.
i never been at duffy's tavern.
even give them a lesson of cooking.
in end duffy's tavern suing them.
but both way, when i'm visit toronto, i'll stay away from duffy's tavern
bad service and bad food.
the sandwich tasted so bad that i could only take a bite.
so disappointing having a such a bad service especially location from codmopolitan.
absolute slowest service ever.
one postal worker working again today.
there were 6 people in line and never requested additional help.
took 15 mins to ship one $19 flat rate box.
i want to support the usps but they are making it impossible.
i'll be using ups or fedex from now on.
a letter has been sitting in my mailbox for 3 days now.
our postal worker for the neighborhood just drives by our house....
good old government postal workers.
i had high hopes for this place, but yardbird let me down.
this non-sense occurred well after their posted 'open' hours.
in theory, this sounds like a phenomenal sandwich; in reality, it was a flop.
strike twoi had a side of grits and they were cold!
strike threeyardbird has somehow taken all the soul out of southern cooking.
food was good but service was not that great.
went late on a sunday night.
brought our check and it took her 15 minutes to come back and it.
my two cabinets and couch that are vintage were ruined in storage.
this was made evident when the movers returned my office furniture.
the movers showed me the damage before it was moved from their storage pod.
i informed them that the furniture they damaged was vintage and literally irreplaceable.
i like the 90s decor, but ...
almost $6 for a simple pretzel (no salt or cheese).
my husband and i played 4 games and it cost us $57.
what the heck, it's almost a luxe to bowl now!
music sucks too!
a word of caution, clearly this place isn't clean.
you could be bringing home some bed bugs stowed away in your luggage.
what a dump.
i would have stayed somewhere else.
decided to go somewhere where i could actually be seated.
the food here is soooooooo gross now!!!
don't eat here...
the chef suckx
wurstle was the worst.
got a groupon ($5 for $10) as it indicated "gourmet" sausages.
if i actually paid the full price of $10.71 i would have returned it.
service was painfully slow.
zero zero zero!
they are the worst delivery company ever!!!!
do not use them!!!!
it would be faster to use a horse and buggy--grrrrr.
i had a horrible experience at this groomer.
i was told the groomers name.
very poor customer service.
i would never leave my pet there.
will never recommend to anyone.
i'd rather go to the olive garden than come here again.
it is beyond loud, as you're surrounded by every drunk twenty-something d-bag/d-baguette.
the food, whenever it arrives, will be underwhelming or poorly prepared.
the blackened chicken shows up cremated.
while i don't do substitutions/omissions, my dinner partners' are usually ignored.
and be sure to nurse your drink because it's unlikely to be refilled.
okay, this is a review from a business manager, not an employee.
i wish i could give this restaurant less then one star.
ordered a burger as well that was over cooked, dry, and just barely palatable.
this place is a dump stay away.
parking is not free,not for kids
the people there are very very rude!
get irritated by customer's questions.
i actually give 0 star, they don't even deserve 1 star.
omg such a disappointment!!!
my husband won't even watch guy's shows anymore..
i hate being this disappointed about a chef we used to adore :(
extremely rude employees!!
i love crepes and try to eat them in every city i go to..
this place is over priced and the crepe sucks, dough undercooked barely anything inside.
just not worth it at all...
not even the nutella one
found coupons in an insert.
thought it was a pretty good deal.
walked in and was asked to take a seat right away, was not greeted.
sat for about 10 min or so while the gentleman talked on the phone.
he finally wrote us up and took our keys.
never going back.
not impressed whatsoever!
went in looking for a pale pink, which i found on the swatch (78).
when she started and i saw it was so much darker.
oh, the hypocrisy.
and your business partner would dare call me a liar?
i would rather sleep under the stars that sleep again at that hotel.
i would give 0 stars if i could.
lost me and my family as dental customers.
5 thumbs down.
worse place ever the people are extremely rude.
i asked a question on where something was and basically got yelled at.
worse tour ever with gc tours!
not worth it and the biggest mistake i made was booking with this company.
our server was very nice, but the wait for the food was unacceptable!!!
brought my husband here for his birthday.
then, she forgot to bring our appetizers.
leave this shit in scottsdale, where it belongs.
and the food was horrible with no taste
children could run a better business.
we saw another table complain and another walk out by this point.
every table around us was covered in dirty dishes.
the service was deplorable, and the food was mediocre.
the food was none the better.
the menu detailed an appetizer completely different from what we received.
we took one bite of it, just terrible.
mind you, there were maybe, five other people in the establishment.
fish tacos during lunch here a couple months ago.
i'm pretty sure i got food poisoning from it.
the fish tasted a little funky and against my better judgement, consumed it.
knocked out for 2 days solid.
to boot, i think i paid 12 dollars for it.
i went in just to get the dip powder on my real nails.
needless to say i will not be going back.
i purchases a birthday party package from living social for my daughter's 11th .
according to the details , they provide riding and led activities.
they also have themes , my daughter chose cowgirl .
my daughter left the party in tears .
they need to better screen the tenants, and the company they keep.
if you rent to trouble, you can figure that's what you will get.
they advertise pleasant peace at the club , far from it.
i live across from the place and it is by far not peaceful.
massive puking and diarrhea insured for the last 18 hrs.
check the drinks before you give them to your kids !!!!
have to say very disappointed with drive up service.
horrible customer service on phone.
avoid using this company.
had another visit here.
food was okay, but the service was beyond terrible.
decent place ruined by terrible service.
so all they could do was make a new pizza and send it out.
and never use them again!
did you know they tax you 55%?
rental for 4 days was $997.00.
my quote from the internet was $271.00.
i am horrified at the service we received.
don't use payless!!!!
this was my first and probably last time at david's bridal.
she pulled two more dresses and then she literally gave up.
well, my friend and i left the store and they lost a possible customer.
what happened to this gem?
i get home to eat and there is not any steak in the burrito.
this was the first time i have ever been disappointed going to panda express.
i order sweet fire chicken breast, beijing beef, and white rice.
the amount of meat that i received was ridiculous.
there was barely enough to feed my child.
it was like they scraped the bottom of the pot for my rice.
white rice is not that difficult to make.
i will not be going back.
all i can say is wow.
do not buy a car from here.
worst experience i've had to date.
came in with cash and was treated poorly by every person on site.
i will never buy a land rover in my life!
went there with a sick child.
filled out the forms and handed my insurance card and license.
the receptionist was rude and inconsiderate as well as painfully slow.
not real food, benedict sauce still taste powder, cafe is cheap, fruits dryed up.
terrible coffee that they try to make up for with nice decor.
the baristas here have no clue how to make a proper cappuccino.
definitely never coming back here.
wow so they had yelp delete my original post.
very disappointed in yelp.
the customer service was horrible just that simple.
i tried again in february and still nothing from them.
if i could give then zero stars for their customer service i would.
i normally love trop!
however, this location has horrible customer service.
horrible customer service.
next day they called and said they cancelled our reservation.
this is one way to make sure people do not come to your place.
after reading many reviews, glad we aren't eating here anyway.
the food quality at this place was terrible.
we paid $25 per person for the lunch buffet on sunday (with aaa discount).
please do yourself a favor to skip this place.
you do not deserve this culinary atrocity!
don't waste your money on their laser treatments!
either the laser or the "laser tech" failed.
there was absolutely no change even the slightest improvement would've been something.
i feel robbed!
it has been two weeks and i haven't heard a word.
this company lacks in customer service even in the social setting.
nice try to declare publicly that they care and then privately they don't.
customer service is almost unavailable, if you're looking for some..
computers in the lobby don't work.
staff says they are always slow.
i stayed here because i needed a business center.
this is ridiculous.
just got here and i'm already frustrated.
stay away from this place.
crab legs are served cold.
not much american food...and tastes awful.
not handicap friendly.
don't waste your money.
only giving one star because some kind of star is required.
between making appt and appt i got a terrible rash on my neck.
i understand that....
however he made it very clear that he wouldn't look at it.
made a purchase but they can't honor delivery schedule.
buyers beware large corporation that couldn't care less about customers.
went to store manager matt and he was just as useless.
no customer resolution skills what so ever.
where do get a manager that can't even solve delivery issues.
be advised shop elsewhere.
brisket nachos were garbage!!
had the chorizo nachos a year ago and they were great.
i was so sad and disappointed with the brisket nachos.
do not waste your money people, vegas is filled with good food.
fix the problem guy!!
there is way too many better shawarma places in downtown.
even cheaper too.
falafel n halal bros just a few examples.
the meat is bland n average.
will not go there again.
i think devry takes advantage of the little guy.
there is no reason on earth that it should cost $500 a credit hour.
you may as well go to yale or asu.
not worth the money at all.
this is the worst vape / e juice i have ever used ..
the store is nice but the product is bogus ..
and it's overpriced ..
all the people get checked in and now the other woman is free too.
thinking i'm next, they both call over the people who checked in after.
they used the app.
i used to come here all the time.
the owner and his wife were always there and very nice.
however, the new staff that they have hired are rude and unknowable.
i will not be back.
can i rate them negative stars???
the worst place ever to get a car.
horrible salesmen (if you could even call them that).
i would never recommend this place to my worst enemy.
worst service ever!!!
sat there for an hour and a half before food ever came.
manager brought the food out and never said a word.
one meal completely inedible as it sat under the heat lamp for ever.
rice and beans were crusted over.
took "half off" the bill...
but wouldn't even take the meal that couldn't be eaten off the bill.
allen is the gm and never even apologized for the wait.
came here on a recommendation from another restaurant owner.
the staff doesn't seem to happy, and really are not that welcoming.
what a difference since our last trip few years ago.
venetian became a dump.
in 3 days we had 1 time room service.
everything was a battle with employees as they wanted to argue over everything!
never coming back here again.
i stepped into this place at 2:30pm.
it's 4:15pm and the employees haven't even looked at my car.
i told them they haven't even started on my car.
he goes and tell his employees that my car is next.
then he leaves.
i'm still waiting on my car to be serviced.
this place is terrible.
wish i would've went anywhere else.
caveat: i didn't eat here.
get out of this place fast.
you have entered the foul zone.
this should not be considered edible food under any circumstance.
if you have better luck than me...you're truly special.
what a mistake.
i left this  pedicure with feet that were rougher than when i came in...
very poor service and a complete waste of time.
i they should do some cleaning in there are well.
the filthy bottles holding the lotions they are using do not inspire confidence.
this place is ridiculous and can't even do what's correctly paid for.
i ordered a massage with aroma therapy which of course is a separate charge.
my wife got her massage but not therapy.
their response was "oh we forgot and assumed the extra was for gratuity".
do yourself a favor and never use this company.
they took a week to place the order for a timer!
then first american home buyers protection does nothing to speed the process along.
what a joke!
the slowest service!!!
so their food isn't all that bad.
there was some crazy stringy cheese action going on.
obviously the stringy cheese quality goes away when it's cold!!
way to go martha!
a plus service!
this company is a joke, i drop them after my a/c went out.
after that homelife wouldnt come out and service the a/c.
i really dont think they care.
i will be contacting bbb right after this.
now im stuff paying for something that i can even use the warranty on.
crazy....never use this company.
they just plain suck!!!
they were so unprofessional.
they made me so uncomfortable that i left.
the staff made an honest mistake the first time, could have been easily forgotten.
because my part was pre-paid, i had to go back and pick it up.
ill still never return to any pep boys as a customer.
the nails are horrible job nothing close too the photos.
dont come here if you want a professional work and great service!!
promise you he will say "who's jimmy" the address is also a fraud !!
i came here for lunch with my daughter and sister.
my sister had the carnitas.
not only is this place overpriced for "freshness" but also for their portions.
multiple times i have had no issues with pizza care...
tonight's episode is the last straw for me and my family.
i questioned their actions and received an annoyed glare and absolute silence.
from beginning to end a horrible meal.
and then the ceiling came down...
the guy never came out for the scheduled estimate.
i called for a status and was greeted rudely by the employee.
rude rude rude.
our server extremely frazzled and very obviously pissed we sat in her station.
dont go here!
not by first bad experience but for n sure my last.
where are the owners?????
old ex tweeker server,  yuck.
we was looking at the menu.
and the employees was talking in vulgar conversations.
i was highly disappointed and it was very highly unprofessional
tried a different chinese restaurant in the area and wish i did not.
got shrimp with mixed vegetables.
the shrimp were small and very overcooked (very mussy).
also got the teriyaki beef which  was like shoe leather (very tough).
will not be going back.
repulsive, not going back, do not recommend...
all around very disappointing experience it's hard to mess up pizza
i left there crying!!!
so i needed to get my sides done and so did my cousin.
i was like omg no way is this happening???
then they both start talking crap about me and my cousin!!!
horrible service and horrible ladies!!
never ever ever coming back!!!
they need new management or they need to close it down all together!!
who the hell hires these guys?
worse then dealing with a walmart employee trying to find something in the store.
i called corporate got not response.
next is bbb.
i had enough of low wage, no classic, unprofessional people treating me like crap.
i would never purchase anything from any of their store every again.
went there today when they just started the business.
the food is average but i would not go there anymore.
i went there 4 minutes before they closed.
the guy attending in the front screamed at me.
in front of the staff i was humiliated, worst experience ever!
i highly recommend not to go to this place!
don't waste your time!
not authentic food.
atmosphere was not great the day we went.
won't be stopping by again.
a lot of better choices out there.
bought a 6s plus from them less than two weeks ago.
not even close to the same hospitable customer service.
the guests were the worst i've ever experienced.
i eat at cheap buffets, people may not have money but are nice.
what a waste of time.
i do not recommend bringing your car here.
they wanted to do paint, and replacement of things that were completely unnecessary.
so far number 6.
i can't believe it's taking this long just to verify i'm a vet!
if i could give them a zero believe me i would have!
this is the worst experience i have ever had at this location.
ventures for an evening out with out of town friends and ended up here.
not a big fan of the white cap and language as well.
i wouldn't repeat and i don't think it's kid friendly.
she recommended the lawn ranger so that is what i ordered.
it seriously tasted like something was rotten and it cost me 9 dollars.
i recommend going across the street to nektar juice bar.
way better service and cheaper price point for tasty delicious refreshing drinks.
came here for a weekend visit to pittsburgh and they completely spoiled our night.
even a valid us visa with photo and date of birth was insufficient.
trying to reason with them was impossible owing to the stubbornness of the management.
all this made worse considering we were waiting for a table for 20 minutes.
i went to sell designer jeans and sundresses at this location.
no wonder they don't have nice clothes, someone like me does not belong there.
went in for a pedicure while passing thru from las vegas to south bend.
ask if they can clean up my cuticles on my hands.
they cut until my hand bled.
will be reporting them to the bbb next.
frozen dinners taste better than the food at this place.
the veggies definitely came from cans.
the ceveiche sucks.
just because they serve fish doesn't mean that they know how to cook it.
i have had beef jurcky that more moist.
so many better options at the rio.
do not go unless you like tasteless food for $50 bucks a plate.
i have replaced them since but not because of a leak.
second, they said my motor mounts needed to be replaced (what?
they should not alter prom dresses.
they shortened my daughter's dress way too much and unevenly.
i will say the beading repair they did was done very well.
i am super unhappy with this place.
i wish i had checked the reviews before i got here.
this has to be the must awful dining experience i have ever had.
honestly i dont usually leave bad reviews.
but help yourself, dont waste your money.
no apologies and i asked for my money.
this took another 10 minutes as they don't know what to do ...
i finally went to the back to asked if i'm getting my money.
very poor service; no communication, no apologies.
wasted 40 mins in this place!
not sure why the hight reviews!!!!
this place is okay if you come drunk.
when all your taste bids are out of wack.
the food is eatable but nowhere close to traditional.
the fact that its not own by taiwanese people explains it.
so if you want okay eatable food you can try it out.
but if you want traditional, unfortunately this probably not a good spot.
usually i have great service and the food is always great.
however tonight the server named patrick was very short and rude to us.
i will never be using this branch ever again.
never go here.
the price was too high for the blandest food i have ever had.
the fries i had needed to be saved by a ton of ketchup.
no salt nothing.
the prime rib was seasonless.
taste like something i'd feed my dog.
never again never ever ever.
not worth the money nor the time.
specially rude indoor security, very responsive (for no reason), bouncers also.
overall just not worth it.
they should hire people with some education
finally got a chance to try xiaomian, but i was really disappointed.
they changed their menu and there is no xiaomian anymore!
i still tried the noodle and i have to say it was really horrible.
the noodle was over boiled and the sauces didn't taste good.
any way, i will not come back again.
you need to know all of your possible deductions.
you have to tell h&r block the deductions you're eligible for.
they will not suggest or explore any possible deductions you're eligible for.
what good is that?
they should have thought of the education deduction.
i do not recommend their services.
i now have to do a 1040x to correct their mistake.
their drivers sit at the gate, wait 30 seconds and then leave.
i literally sat in the dark for 7 weeks.
if i could give it no stars i would!!!!
way way way over priced for bad/ok pizza...
over $12.00 for 3 slices who do they think they are...?
there food is ok at best!
no chips, you have to pay for them.
no marinated carrots, you have to pay for them.
tea was out.
we should have taken a hint when the parking lot was empty at 5pm
i would give customer service less than 1 star if possible.
work that was to take 4-5 weeks is now going on 5 months.
we have heard every excuse in the books from terry about the delays.
would not recommend  this place to anyone for vintage car work.
will add to this later.
would not go back.
the servers were working hard, but greatly understaffed.
had to beg to be served.
couldn't tell you if the food was good or not.
by then we just needed to gulp it down and get out the door
save your money and go to starbucks!
worst place ever.
diagnosed my husband with glaucoma..
for years doing drops.
went to another place where he was told he didn't have glaucoma.
doctor yee  should go back to school.
when he dropped off the car it was $240.00.
advantage stands for takes advantage.
wont buy from auto nation bmw again.
terrible service from chad two years in a row.
he is not helpful at all and has no personality.
bmw pre certified vehicle should have been covered since the day it was purchased.
i lived here for a year and couldn't wait to get out!
the location is the only positive thing i can think of.
overpriced and poorly managed
really bad service .
the food is not good .
we been waiting for like 30 mins for our food to come .
if i could give this place zero stars, then i would.
i have called on several different days and still no person.
don't waste your time and money on ace!!!
i love this food but this location is always disgusting.
i ate here the first day they opened.
they must have had 10 people working but the service was not the best.
they clearly did not prepare well for a grand opening.
it's like they were training people on the fly.
hello- you need to do this before your first customer walks in the door!
food is also so mediocre and so bland that i won't be back.
on trac allowed for someone unknown to me sign for a package..
don't ever make a reservation at this restaurant!
nobody apologized or offered any sort of empathy for what had happened.
everyone waiting for a table was appalled by this behavior.
no manager apologized and nobody working cared.
we walked out and they didn't even care.
i got 2 pizzas from here.
they ripped me off.
i paid over $20 for 2 large cheese pizzas.
i seriously could've got better quality and quantity at little caesars..
i know he lied to me.
they don't even have a restroom for customers!
placed an order for pick up at 6:30pm.
i was told food would be ready in 20-25 minutes.
i get there at 7 and food was not ready until 7:30pm!
if it takes longer, then say so!
and if it does take that long, make sure it taste good and warm!
how are you "best of lv"?
definitely not this location!
i went out of my way this morning to stop at 6:40am.
they weren't open.
open at 6 am huh?
get between me and coffee in the morning and i am an uphappy girl.
how do coffee shops make opening at 7am?
maybe i will come back during bankers hours.
my girlfriend and i just went to the kitchen for the first time.
we walked in and we're greeted by the nice girl behind the counter.
that we emiditly left.
went for breakfast at the recommendation of the hotel i was stay.
poor customer service , would not recommend
here's a thought, maybe someone that speaks better english should answer the phone?
lastly, when i called they said delivery would be 30-40 mins...
i waited over an hour and 15 mins to receive my food.
definitely will not ever buy from this place again, spend your money somewhere else.
btw, i am paying $1,800+/month for a 1 bedroom (short-term lease).
dear arnold, i wish you were my employee.....
so i could fire you.
you are the most rude and lazy person i've came across in las vegas.
this location sucks.
omg this place keeps disappointing me..
portions are getting smallerservice is slow on a monday night...
really wish they woul up their game
i was extremely disappointed in the van gogh-alive exhibit.
the large screens projected muddy looking, pixilated, blurry images.
i was expecting vivid, sharp images.
van gogh was all about intense hues and bold brush strokes.
this was totally lost.
this exhibit was not worth the $25 in my opinion.
save your money for a museum that can exhibit his originals.
"ham charcuterie" is a few slivers of indifferent ham with dry toast.
beer was ok.
the nasty breakfast place, horrendous everything tasted like lard..
horrible and bad tasting
the servers were cold and machine like.
worse still they were stingy as hell with the toppings.
i won't be going back (and frankly i hate that airport to begin with).
remember,  they are working for us the buyers not for themselves.
better luck next time..tm!
i am tired of dealing with this company.
their prices are much better than lumber liquidators also.
long story short this place went to shit.
constantly forgetting customer service bed side manner.
manager...ashley is very rude and doesn't know the business or products.
i'm telling everybody i recommended to find somewhere else.
when you approach the staff they all act dumb.
forgetting towels constantly and say it's our job to remind them.
folks, this was the worse italian food i've ever eaten.
maybe it was a bad day (i doubt it).
i really don't know.
it was sooooo dark inside, we could hardly read the menu.
all in all, it won't happen again for us.
and i love italian food!
i am appalled by the service i received here.
i was thoroughly disappointed when i called and they requested evidence.
worst indian place in town.
this chevron is not at fault but the new one at 780 e.
horizon dr property.
this place has been open for maybe 2 months now or 3.
well i have been in there at least 8 times now.
i have seen 8 different people since i have gone in this place.
the worst chevron ever!!!
wow, what a disappointment.
this place used to be good.
we took two bites and just walked out not bothering to complain.
the service was excellent.
the staff was quick, polite, and fun.
however, food was very bad.
the tortillas were bland, thick, flour tortillas.
the fillings were equally bad.
customer service is not available at this location.
come on scottsdale you can do better than this.
service was atrocious.
first my order was forgotten, for nearly the entirety of the meal.
i was only given my order after asking them about it multiple times.
upon finally receiving my order, it came without salt.
unsalted food from a restaurant, unbelievable.
we have used this limousine service for two years, with multiple airport transfer roundtrips/month.
two no-shows, shame on the limo service.
four no-shows, shame on us for continued confidence in their business.
we will no longer patronize them.
i am so frustrated with this office.
their communication is the worst!
i dropped off a brace in early september to be refurbished.
i called and no one knew anything about my brace.
finally i got a message telling me to come pick it up.
they are terrible.
its obvious they do not want our business.
the manager is a joke.
she argued with our table over a $10 split charge.
she wasn't offering us anything additional for that fee other than an extra plate.
on top of that, she told us it was a 30 minute wait.
however, there was an empty table that she just "forgot" about.
if you are thinking of dining here, think again.
i hate salty food, (mcdonalds does this to there fries now too) hey!!!!
customers can sprinkle their own damn food with salt.
i was pissed and wished i had not went.
the worst experience of mani/pedi of my life.
started from disrespectful treatment from manager/owner(?) to a sloppy unprofessional job done by employees.
if it would be possible id give (-) 5 stars.
meat kinda bland....
offered us a soup...
but it never came.
wayy too many lights, went blind while eating.
do not rent with these scam-artists!
i will never do business with this company again.
oh, and two out of three of us were sick the next day.
not exactly the best property management company i've ever worked with.
i had a pool that was always dirty, because the pump never worked.
i was left without ac for far too long living in las vegas.
the spa was never cleaned.
but they were quick to demand wall thrus.
still waiting on my deposit.
it's been a month and ten days.
this place sucks end of story.
they have good deals especially for people who love unlimited data for fair pricing.
it was probably a bad egg in the bunch of new moto x phones.
cox puts you under a bunch of promotions and doesn't tell you.
then your bill rises $100.00 out of no where.
they are pushy and try to keep you even when you try to cancel.
direct tv is where its at!
slow service ..
not coming back here ..
not even to use the restroom !!!
they don't have enough staff to serve anyone.
we waited forever just for a first drink.
oh yea and we were seated at the bar.
we left without eating.
hopefully we find something to eat.
this place sucks ass
i regret to pay over 9000$ for this place .
and they rush u in and out too i don't think is.
honest place .
so i will never come back here again.
next time they shouldn't do false advertisement i'm really disappoint about this place .
we went here 5 months ago or so and they were ok.
not great but not horrible if you had the 2-for-1 coupon.
we went back today and boy had they gone downhill.
even with the 2-for-1 coupon we felt ripped off paying only $10 each.
this is the worst jib i have ever been to.
my mom found a hair in her chicken sandwich.
service as crappy and our food took forever.
i will never set foot in this place again!
over cooked meat.
it's like if dennys tried to run a five star buffet.
pretty sure you pay an extra $30 because they have a cutesy name.
if you have automatic payments, you better check your bank statements!
i caught them debiting my checking account twice!
supposedly i am not the only customer who got charged twice?
this is why i cancelled cox cable, charging me something with out a notice?
looks like it's time to cancel my automatic payments.
check your bank statements!
thought i would stop off for breakfast and try out guy's restaurant.
what a disappointment!
a cold meal with some kind of chips that were soggy.
last week i wanted to have a late lunch.
too many other choices on younge street to become a so-so restaurant.
the donuts they had seem like day-old donuts.
forget the coffee in krispy kreme as it tastes like gas station coffee.
very dry anhd bland.
since when does a tall peppermint mocha get rung up with an extra shot?
is this true?
why am i paying extra?
when i asked for a receipt she said they were out of tape.
the drink isn't even good.
i realize the peppermint isn't sugar free but come on guys...
it was a bad bad experience.
really, i paid that for our rental missed day.
they regret my inconvenience, i missed the event i was taking the trip for.
the only good part about it was we finally got there and landed safely.
how do we go about suing a company?
not to mention that they charged us more than they quoted.
i'm worried we wont see our stuff again.
do not use this company!
they don't even deserve one star.
i will never go back that is unhealthy and a disease waiting to happen
ok, i get it...
shit happens, but restaurants are supposed to be ready for holidays.
good luck with this company.
this is on a house that is two years old.
his words, "read the fine print".
not a good business person.
got a rental that's been heavily smoked in.
to exchange we would have to go back upstairs.
reported it on checking out but she didn't write it down.
had been here a few years back, wow did this go downhill.
service was horrifically slow - didn't help that she had way too many tables.
food - bad, just plain bad.
had some fried shrimp - how hard is that?
over-cooked blobs of mess.
don't waste you're time.
go across the street to brennan's.
had delivery for mother's day or the day before.
did not deliver on mother's day.
now it's monday morning and they still have not been delivered.
my negative rating relates to their billing office.
i called dukes of air because i had a couple of warm rooms.
the tech adjusted a few vents, checked the attic and found no disconnected ductwork.
i would have remembered $65.
i was not asking for a service call.
i was asking for an estimate.
i'm giving it a 1 because i can't give it a zero.
we went here with high hopes looking for some bar food.
while the staff were very friendly and helpful, the food was absolutely terrible.
chicken tenders were very dry and left much to be desired.
stayy away from the ranch dressing, as it was very watered down.
this event was way too crowded.
for the price of the ticket they should have cut it off sooner.
poor service, i'll never ever go back again.
the way it's ran is disgusting.
500$ down the drain.
dont waste your money here!
watch out when you buy meat here .
shame on you guys
today feb 16,2018 i call to make an appt.
and im told i cant use it they no longer serve this gift!!!!
i was invited unexpectedly to have a pedicure at this place.
this store staff & management were horrendous!!
i went in with a few things to switch sizes.
that's all just get a different size.
char kept trying to get me to purchase other jeans...
my items were gifts & i just needed smaller/bigger sizes.
left without anything changed & an hour wasted in my day!!
won't shop there ever again!!
why did they make my cheeseburger with no cheese?
also, they forgot my straw.
there's always a 20 min wait at the drive thru as well.
the excuse is they're always training someone or under staffed.
too bad it does not have the service to match.
when i came here there was one other customer and three employees.
i spent a while wandering through the store to finally find what i need.
i will not be back.
the local staff is awesome!
this "work" aggravates, frustrates, and alienates customers (me).
our server had a nasty attitude that she definitely needs to change.
she was very snarky and extremely rude.
completely ruined my appetite.
will not be coming back again.
the hostess and the waitress were both very friendly.
ps-oh wait, i was supposed to be mean...
might be the worst service i've ever experienced in vegas.
the food was bland and just tasted bad.
the music was good the food was good, the service was horrible!
the manager, melissa, was incredibly rude!
for the price of the food and drinks you'd expect better customer service.
i love toby keith, but i don't love this bar.
we have always loved olive garden, but i will never return to this one.
it has really gone downhill over the past few years.
the drinks all tasted terrible.
the coke did not taste right.
i paid for a frozen drink, and it was awful.
we asked for dressing on the side and got it on the salad.
we asked for a bread refill and never got it.
the marina sauce was so spicy it tasted (and looked) like salsa.
the floors were filthy.
we walked out with most of the food and drink still on the table.
when in to fill up my car.
when i requested for an air service, attendant gave me the look.
he wants to charge me a dollar .
went to the next frys gas station next block.
frys is now my favorite gas station.
me and my family spend about $150 a week for gas.
first time here, but service is okay so far.
after waiting 35 minutes in line they said they are out of the slut!
they have 8 items on the menu and their store is called the slut.
how can you run out of it.
the sandwiches were average and nothing special.
totally over priced.
the guy didn't even try to accommodate for the inconvenience !
will never come back.
went to this location for lunch today.
the waiter smelled like a pack of cigarettes, the salad was soaked in dressing.
there was hardly any lettuce in the salad as well.
my sons lasagna was cold and my ravioli was a cold congealed mess.
we're not even sure we will go to any olive garden again.
i ordered mimosa and when it came i noticed that the glass was cracked.
went to this location today for breakfast.
but what really got to me was my orange juice.
i was charged nearly 7 dollars for a glass.
it was luke warm and it wasn't even real orange juice!!!
i will not return to any hash house restaurant.
avoid if possible.
shame on panera!
worst home warranty service i have ever dealt with.
ate there on yesterday (19 march 2017) at around 5p.
i wish that i had gotten the name of the waitress.
she was really mean.
her facial expressions were mean as well as her hand gestures.
totally waste of money.
my 5 yr old spit out his pepperoni pizza potato ...
now we have to find something else for dinner
just visited today for a quick bite.
decided to try the salmon poke bowl while my girlfriend chose the salmon tacos.
took about 30-40mins for the food to get to us.
we were also the only people in the restaurant at this time.
quality of the food is average.
first and last time i'll be visiting this establishment.
he couldn't even see my cuticles he was cutting air.
charging for new parts when actually using used parts.
it isn't overhead when you lie to the customer.
airmen from luke!
the worst experience i've ever had with a domino's.
both my fianc & i were calling.
we spent 40 minutes calling and gave up.
absolute worst experience ive ever had with any pizza company.
worst customer service!!!!
what's kind of tim hortons is that?
what if i was diabetic?
i will never ever come to this tim hortons again.
please reevaluate this location.
it's such a shame cause it's a nice one too.
you be the judge - $980 for 4 backing plates and 2 drums.
$600 to replace one waste tank slide valve.
i think that's about $500 too high
worst shopping experience in my life!!!!
would give 0 stars but it wouldn't let me.
do not do business with ashley furniture!!!
read the consumer report reviews before you buy!!!
extremely overrated and overpriced for this kind of place.
food was just ok but not what you pay for it.
2 adults 1 child, 60 bucks.
stick with denny's orihop.
sells fake, cheap phones for prices that are unreasonable.
my phone was bought here for $400 and it was an iphone 6s.
it had symbols on the back that authentic iphones didn't have.
this place was a total let down.
the food lacked flavor and seemed like it had all been canned or frozen.
nothing seemed fresh.
do not go here for pizza!!
the pizza arrived late for delivery by 40 minutes, was cold and like cardboard..
hardly any sauce and tasteless crust.
definitely not like nyc pizza...
my dress was altered disproportionately/not symmetrical.
the customer service lady was loud and talking over me.
aggressive and smug.
she would not let me speak.
she said some pretty  rude things.
she never took responsibility for anything.
was dishonest about our initial agreement or she remembered incorrectly (3 or 4 things).
i wish i would have read some reviews before taking my wedding dress here.
it could have saved me money and a huge disapointment.
trash, there are 50 million mexican restaurants in az.
i would rather eat at filbertos then this place.
slow service, crappy food and dirty.
i felt as if i was in high school all over again.
a complete lack of professionalism at every angle.
staff here are slow.
if you bank here on a daily bases, they'll recognize you.
no more business teller, makes it difficult for business owners to do banking.
bankers are rude & never follow up on any disputes.
i'm very disappointed, now i understand why the lady looks very boring !!!
let's just say they get an a+ in customer disservice!!
i will not be going back, that's for sure!
i took my dress shirts back without alterations.
i will find another tailor to do them.
my encounter with the woman at the store was nice, she was friendly...
but as a business, i will not go back.
i will not be returning.
she told us priority was drive thru.
so she kept taking their orders and making their items.
meanwhile ignoring us.
she was really rude.
again, never returning.
the man there seemed to just not understand one word we said.
will never take my business here ever!
worst tattoo shop ever.
chris is the worst.
my tattoo was extremely overpriced.
seriously go anywhere else.
you could get a better stick and poke.
also the place looked mad unsanitary.
dont go here.
the doctor told me that he would, but the pa changed his mind.
i do not recommend this place at all.
go at your own risk.
so happy to finally have epic gone!
all tonya did was anger and fine people for none sense.
she accomplished nothing beside spend money!
her professional level was so horrible word could not describe it!
my advice avoid this company heck she should close up shop!
she doesn't know what she is doing!
funny that there is more than one community complaining about her lack of capabilities!
could definitely use some attention in the customer service department.
waited 15 minutes to order.
i wanted to walk but was craving my smoothie.
positive i won't be back no matter how good this thai wrap is.....
stopped by the fireside for a cold beer and some appetizers.
we ordered potatoe skins and artichoke dip and 2 beers.
the potato skins were okay nothing special and the artichoke dip not that good.
we will not go back there.
arrived in town and they would not honor our prearranged price or reservation.
so much for booking ahead online with budget!
we will not use this outfit again.
we visited here for the first time for lunch today.
i will say i am not impressed and will not return.
i was told no.
not even a let me check with the manager.
normally i would leave the restaurant and go someplace else that would accommodate me.
but since we were with other people i stayed.
i ordered a regular item, ate 3 bites and was done.
it's sad as it's a beautiful restaurant and good atmosphere.
we tried to give this a chance.
we asked who the chef was and the person working asked why it mattered.
we said we just wondered and he rolled his eyes at us.
save your money!
also, the staff seemed lazy.
the soup seemed like it was made days before and warmed up.
she had nothing but stank ass attitude no edges and a flat ass.
never coming here again.
worst customer service ever.
if there was any way to give this place negative 5 stars i would.
by far the worst company i have ever done business with.
the best part of this place is that the employees are nice.
but nice is the only positive thing i can say about them.
for the lack of consistency, the prices are extremely high.
you have become a disgrace of this fine city.
you are a soiled dove.
shame on you all!
i was also told that the financial aid dept.
obviously i will not be attending...
i had a california bowl with mahi mahi on august 17 around 7 pm.
some of the rice in the bowl were soft, some were very hard.
probably they were sitting out for too long and dried up.
or some of the rice remained uncooked.
it hurts the teeth.
i had to sort out the dried hard rice.
also, after eating i started to feel uncomfortable about half an hour later.
i felt i was getting sick.
fortunately, i was able to overcome and got better.
not going back again.
ordered a breakfast burrito with eggs, potatoes, bacon, sour cream and red sauce.
the burrito was about 95% mushy potato.
it was like eating flavorless mashed potatoes wrapped in a tortilla.
definitely don't recommend.
don't buy any type of ring from this place.
my wife and i were going to renew our vows on hawaii.
i picked out a really nice 4 carat ring for the wedding.
or so i thought.
they gave us the exact same ring 2 weeks later.
i should have listened to the reviews.
the food quality was terrible.
1st time here and will not be back ..
shrimp has no taste and was not a full lb..
service was shitty and i had to keep getting up for drink refills !!
should just stay faithful to hot n juicy this place just sucks !!!!!
if i could rate a 0 i would .
ordered some scotch and found that the glass had a chip on the tim.
my lip was not cut but it did get a bit of an abrasion.
won't come back here again.
take these things seriously.
awful place to live in.
my car got stolen in front of our apartment.
charged us with so many different things when we left that didn't even know.
they said we didn't clean the apartment but we left it very clean.
horrible staff and management.
food is acceptable but service is bad.
the person taking orders likes to bad mouth customers in chinese.
if only you know what she says about you.
i will only come back if i m desperate.
never going back again.
really, really bad attitude.
i brought a brand new pair of calvin klein pants there.
they lost 2 buttons and had the audacity to say i lost the buttons!
additionally, i am not interested in their prosteletizing jesus.
prices are high and the attitude you're going to get sucks.
worst drs office i have ever been to.
the wait times are outrageous and the nurses are rude.
save your time and find professionals.
if you want to be surrounded by dirty unkempt people...and no service ...
this is your place
service was rude and food portion are tiny like those mini-plastic foods.
they charge extra for refilling the tiny jams and hot water.
macarons and cakes are mediocre, it's better to purchase cake from longos imho.
if you're in the mood for macarons, i'd recommend butter avenue or la bamboche.
for afternoon / high tea, windsor arms still takes the cake!
heard great things about this place but i was not impressed at all...
had a chopped salad and it was so boring.
hmmm, we were stuck between shows at mgm so tried the buffet.
i wonder how they stay in business??
very hard to find anything good to eat!
price is quite high for what you get.
do gamblers get comp-ed to reduce the $25 cost.
if you must eat at mgm, find something else...
but, hey, there was no line!
food was ok.
service was very horrible.
our waiter omar was very rude :( the food was wrong.
instead of apologizing he brings back the food and throws it on the table.
horrible customer service.
the line is always backed up because of this.
seems like common sense to me.
no wonder the place was 1/2 empty.
dr patel was very condescending to me and scoffed at any concern i had.
i was really hopeful based on a recommendation but i will never go back.
my wife was extremely upset with this place.
worst customer service ever.
the designer should be embarrassed.
5 grand lost.
i wanted to adopt a dog i saw on their web site this morning!
which would be fine if he got adopted.
but not so much if he got euthanized, or was about to.
so far, no luck.
why make it so hard to pull a dog off the e-list, you jerks?
me and my fianc came here for drinks.
we were seated outside  and it wasn't too busy.
we waited for over 25 minutes and  not a single wait staff came by.
the one good thing -- the hostesses were very polite.
this place is awful.
i wouldn't recommend this place at all.
my last two visits there have been very disappointing.
wait staff obviously did not want to be there.
judging from the managers attitude i can understand why.
my experience has been as bad or worse than what everyone else has written.
i don't know if i will ever see my stuff again
i would never recommend this company to even my worst enemy.
he full out lied and probably wasn't aware he was on speaker.
the next day we moved lenders.
we went with new american funding - vicky liu.
she is the best.
if you're reading this, you may want to do your homework on this company.
your experience at subway is relative to its location and employees.
maybe he's prone to seizures, i don't know.
hands down the worst shit hole in las vegas for chinese food..
worst service and people in vegas
totally disgusted me, i will never eat there again.
i filed a complaint with the health department..
food was bland and disgusting.
server was very nervous and forgetful multiple times.
overpriced but used cheap ingredients.
got food poisoning due to botch food they recommended.
if our kids didn't live here we wud never stay here.
no pull thru for big rigs.
i went to this shop before and had the best experience!
i went back for a fill 2 weeks later.
i went and got one of them fixed and had the worst experience.
so now i have a nail that is a completely different color.
and to make it worse, i had to pay 4$ to get it fixed.
i will not be back.
worst experience i ever had.
there's a reason a urgent care place is called urgent care !
u'll probably be dead by the time they see u!.
i cannot speak for the original location, but this ones pizza is terrible.
if you want amazing pizza go to the highly underrated grazie pizzeria.
one of the worst haircuts i have ever had.
the owner (iraj) is absolutely terrible with cuts and will mess your hair up!
i went to del sol fountains to buy a new pond pump.
(fluid dynamics and physics apparently don't apply to water features in this state).
ordered delivery via skip the dishes.
the siu mai i received were raw in the middle.
not only is this disgusting, but it's dangerous too.
will never order from them again.
edited to add: skip gave me a full refund, at least.
there is no redemption here!
as i explained he  nodded his head and kept asking about the math??
the service here was deplorable.
i heard several complaints of the lack of service, and i experienced it firsthand.
how do you forget rice with an entree at an indian restaurant.
i hope the food is excellent, but i doubt it.
bad for business!!!
asked for a simple double heart henna tattoo.
came out worse than i could have imagined.
the photo i uploaded speaks for itself.
never has enough cashiers working.
lines are always long.
at the photo center there is never anyone there to help.
to find help it takes like 15 to 25 for someone to help you.
one of the worst breakfast experiences that i have had.
ordered 2 eggs sunny side up, hashbrowns and sausage.
waffle house would have been a better choice than this ihop.
the pharmacist at this location is very rude and unprofessional!
no respect at all!
worst parking for visitors ever!!!!!
horrid food pretending to be what should be succulent and aromatic indian cuisine.
what is chicken biryani?
dry potato side was tasteless.
boiled potatoes have more flavour!
i can't speak to the food, i didn't stay long enough to try it.
walked in and waited fifteen minutes for our drink order.
ended up leaving then.
some big girl.
i come here all the time but this was a 1st...
i've had a spanish lady before she was nice & good service...
crooks do not go there.
walked in to buy components for school project.
chinese store manager goes and accuses us of stealing.
worst shopping and customer service experience ever.
i was very unimpressed with this olive garden location.
secondly, the kitchen is one of the worst in the entire company.
i finally spoke to a manager who comp'd my meal.
i will never be back to this location.
i wish somebody wrote about this.
food doesn't taste good at all.
lots of plates empty and not being refilled.
do not eat here!!
i would not recommend this place.
worst sushi i've ever had instantly made me throw up.
this fish smells and looks old.
also the wonton chips that come with the soup taste like dish soap.
everything i order now has to be throw away as for its not edible.
highly disappointed with service and food.
i have been coming here for over 5 years and it had never disappointed.
the chicken did not taste like chicken.
the food was almost frozen.
at first i thought they had a bad day and returned.
this day was worst than the first.
tokyo express is no longer the restaurant it was.
the owners need to hire new chefs and check the quality of their food.
it's sad that i won't be going back after years of loyalty.
this was by far the worst tuna sub i've ever had.
they were sloppy and very unappealing.
thought it would taste better than it looked, but it definitely did not.
to top it all off now we both feel nauseous.
i have waited a long time to write this review.
i was here in february of 2016.
i have never had food poisoning before so i am traumatized from this experience.
i visited a few days ago and i had high expectations.
i ordered some common korean fare and it smelled good.
i finished my soup and boxed up everything and went home.
the worst customer service i received from a sales associate.
i will stick to noah's or wholefoods.
after everything  i still made a purchase.
he couldn'tprocess his credit card and made him get cash.
ripped him off to a towing charge of $405.
if i were you i would think again.
to top it off bad mouth him to repair shop.
so now i can not dispute the charge and out a lot of money.
these people are awful!!!!!!!!
from the outside this place looks great.
but once you drive trough the filthy catacombs to park your car it fades.
generally very run down and ill maintained feeling.
i was glad to leave.
this place is entirely disappointing.
absolute rudeness and managing a line.
the most miserable people on earth work here.
not sure if that was a part of the job requirement or not?
also they go back and forth handling the food and cash without using gloves.
ie: when scooping blackberries out of jar to make aai bowl.
sadly, i do enjoy the aai bowl & the location works for me.
every person working had a scowl.
took 27 minutes for our server to take our orders.
food just ok, nothing that will make me want to return.
after the treatment from this station, i'm swearing off hertz for good.
(i'm not mistaking the credit check with a credit card authorization.
for the price of $25 it was awful.
limited selection and what was there was not appealing at all.
over breaded everything, limited salad bar and side dishes.
carved meats selection looked ok but did not make up for the rest.
not customer sensitive.
i would not recommend giving this shop your business.
my apt was entered 2 times with no notification from mgmt.
and they destoryed my things in the meantime.
the property mgr suggested i contact the police and i did.
no i will not pay $50 and i want this activity stopped.
danielle cannon was rude and unprofessional and raised her voice with me.
don't rent here.
the food was good, but the server, i think her name is dawn...
forgot my coffee..
if i ever come back, i'll have to make sure she isn't my server.
but i probably won't, i don't like to feel like i'm burdening someone.
i purchased carpet from home depot 8 years ago.
the carpet was installed by western states.
i recently contacted home depot to have my carpet in 2 bedrooms re-stretched.
western states can over and looked at the carpet.
home depot contacted me about the cost.
chocked, i contact another business.
was quoted a better price and there was no charge on furniture.
we could only see 3 total rats at that time.
now my husband tells me that there are 5 and he called the office.
one thing they could do is tell the neighbors to quit feeding them.
worst cut and style,i had a young male senior stylist.
instead i got about a 3-4 inch cut with layers around my whole head.
still waiting on our car.
i will update this when we receive the car.
called in to inquire about a piercing.
i've been here before and have heard great things about your establishment.
she gave me the most snide and condescending answer ever.
word to the wise, don't visit this location simply because of her.
the dessert was great...now the rest of the story.
we got seated quickly enough and the atmosphere was really good.
it was 109 outside so definitely uncomfortable.
we ordered and then waited at least 45 minutes for our desserts to arrive.
yes, we only had dessert!
the service was horribly slow only made worse by the sweltering heat!
the tables were absolutely filthy!
i won't ever go to this location again!
when the couch arrived they said they wouldn't even bring it upstairs.
this place is s joke!
i was like i'm not a new patient.
for a dang pap.
y'all are a joke.
i'll go find another dr with at bs y'all are on.
don't waste your time.
you'll die waiting on them.
staff were extremely rude.
not an establishment that appears to be seeking business.
my mac had a cracked screen.
the part that connects the screen to the keyboard was melted.
i would not suggest taking your products to them.
quite simply, this insurance company is a scam.
one of their customers hit my car and totaled it.
craziest thing i've ever heard.
terrible all around !
yesterday i had a carwash at francis and sons by alma school rd..
i already gave them a tip but still they took my money!!!
i wish i could give them 0 stars for their quality of customer service.
they have 0!
i'm gonna stick to ordering from effectus clothing or sneaker geeks.
do not use this company.
they hire the cheapest labor and you are left with the result.
they are very rude and unprofessional.
don't let their showroom fool you, what you see is not what you get.
you will be very disappointed.
my friend and i went here for nye dinner.
it didn't at all feel like a nice restaurant but the prices sure were!
in the end she removed it from our bill.
extremely disappointed given that the london and ny ones are amazing!
super slow service.
burgers came out burned on the outside and pink in the middle.
fries were cold.
3rd visit, with each worse than the prior.
won't be back.
what a total disappointment this place was.
save your money and time, head elsewhere.
i guess job placement doesn't seem of the most importance.
i figure that to be pretty important public knowledge so i'm sharing that.
tonight one star is suffice.
reserved seats again at the bar w/ no one there yet.
last two times, the people never came.
pointing out something that you should think about.
isn't showing up a  part of the service ?
cant really service it if your not there lol what a joke
i love los dos!
these guys were terrible.
one employee said people needed to learn about there cars before coming to them.
be very very very careful with these people.
she never said hello, asked if she could help us or anything.
so we walked back out.
not the worst experience of my life, but definitely not a good one.
for some reason he spent the majority of the time on my shoulder blades.
oh and despite what the sign at the register says, tip is mandatory.
i couldn't leave until he got the tip he wanted.
i won't be going back there.
hour and half for food.
and can't even get our drink orders straight.
staying here and the prices charged, you would think first class service.
we have traveled the world and have not have experienced such bad service!
had a turkey wrap (which was tiny) was skeptical on the corned beef...
for the wrap they used processed meat that had a shine to it.
pass on this place.
this was most definitely the second worse thai food i have ever had.
the curries were absolutely horrible, the fried rice was under-cooker, and absolutely tasteless.
the spring rolls seemed stale and were cold.
the crazy noodles were heavily al-dente, and drove me crazy - being bland!!!
i would not recommend this place to anyone.
i really wanted to like this store, after seeing so many good reviews!
they refused, because 'they'll remember the dress'.
i will never fly with them again.
that's soon was about an hour and a half after that statement.
staff was very unsure of themselves, and came across rude.
i can not recommend this company to anyone.
the pickle barrel at yorkdale is the worst.
sent back the fish and chips and burger.
the restaurant was like a sauna making it a very uncomfortable experience.
the waiter was not attentive.
stay away from this restaurant.
the glasses i've gotten were not a good investment.
do yourself a favor.
don't waste your money at this place!
go to ceasar bacchanal.
rude service and there's  barely anything to chose from.
legs were so salty.
prime rib was ok.
sushi selection was ok.
the salmon poke was very good.
dinner for 2 on a friday night was $85.
i went here once - it was before the pirates-cubs wildcard game.
they blasted the "go cubs go" song.
i'll never go back.
let's go bucs!
these people are awful.
i hired them to move me across country.
while moving me they broke a bunch of my stuff.
i even caught them breaking stuff on video.
they refuse to pay for their negligence.
i am going to have to file a lawsuit to get paid.
we were at the palace station ...
the food and service were terrible.
this place was by far the worst.
meat dishes were dry and tough.
selection was very poor.
we will not return to this place.
it was really terrible.
man, that is annoying.
placed a take-out order at the bar.
not that hard.
stay away from sierra air!!!
rude..no customer service..flat out dont care for their customers!!
they acted like they could care less.
we decided on a 5 peice entertainment center from here.
we had nothing but problems!
will never buy from them again!!!
this place has to be the worst smelling bar i ever been in.
walked in and a smell of a rotten outhouse overwhelmed us.
claimed the worse bathroom she ever entered.
the clientel looked as they been there all week and too hadn't ever showered.
the haircut is really hit and miss here.
i ended up getting a haircut like a granny.
i regret not stopping the stylist in the middle to make sure.
i can't do much with the hair except maybe wearing a hat everyday.
this place is kept like a jail.
the bartender tried to rip us off, and when asked for a bill...
came back with a different and a much lesser amount.
luxy is a jail and not a club...
it makes downtown clubs look like heaven.
i do not recommend luxy for anybody.
amc charges for kids 2 years old instead of free.
they charge a convience charge to book ticket online on website.
you can join a membership for 12 dollars to offset the charge.
what highway robbery.
the nachos are not worth the $20.
they are maybe $12 nachos at best.
atmosphere is dismal, morale is low.
it is super dark and not an ideal place for a date.
this is the worst airport starbucks i have encountered.
they are incredibly slow and mess up orders often.
i'm not a crazy orderer either.
i get a grande cappuccino and somehow it comes out with coconut milk.
it seems like they even know it's wrong and just don't care.
don't waste your time.
the food is bland, cold and overpriced.
this is not the place to end your vegas trip.
i stopped by the grill while flying through on a work trip.
the table was dirty after being quickly wiped up by a busser.
your money is better spent elsewhere.
very bad service.
we basically got ignored all the time.
they obviously are busy serving the guest they think are important.
i am so surprised this place got such high ratings.
the food is only so-so and expensive for its taste.
won't come again.
first off the place is very loud.
food average and highly overpriced.
our food got to our table before our beers.
so i said to just cancel the beers.
you guessed it, the same 2 beers we ordered, even hotter now.
pad thai was way too sweet and uncooked.
angle wings have no taste and over cooked.
in general their food is pretty bad.
i won't come here again.
i'm mad that i purchased something from them and i'll never shop there again!
worst customer service ever!
everyone else seemed bothered and annoyed if you had a question!
this was my first gun, it's a major purchase!
there are so many options so i had a few questions.
if they don't honor a price match, i'll never shop there again!!!
the product was good but the staff (romeo) was disrespectful and rude.
this is just an over priced chipotle.
the jalapeno potato balls they advertise to be the best thing ever are terrible.
would not recommend it or eat here again.
didn't expect a buffet but i walked over to check it out.
the food was okay-ish, it was edible.
yeah never going back herevery weird experience and off putting.
a guy walks by and tells the host/server there are people at the door.
but we let it slide.
eventually she takes our order and doesn't write anything down.
good customer service is a must
they needed to cancel two different appointments within 24 hours.
this process repeated itself about half a dozen times.
finally cancelled altogether.
the service there was horrible.
i walked in and didn't see a hostess.
finally sat down at the bar and looked at a menu.
was acknowledged but never got service.
the bartender and another gentleman were too busy discussing business.
waited patiently for 15 minutes and finally just got up and walked out.
this was by far the worst mexican food i've ever had in toronto.
the chimichanga itself was small and tasteless.
with drink and all this amounted to nearly $20.
beyond this was a pretty lame atmosphere with mostly career drunks and sports-bros.
i'm pretty blown away by how crappy the whole things was.
we checked this place out after a recommendation from a friend.
ambience is nice but the attitude and the food killed it for me.
the people are nice, but that's about all.
but i guess that's their version of express.
if you can find a different shop for your pedicure.
bad night at brio.
smoke in the restaurant.
service slow and overwhelmed.
missed order items.
can someone explain how the group pork bone soup for $13.99 per person works?
can someone math wtf went wrong there?
they were also pretty petty because we didn't tip them after that experience.
watch out watch your family
aaron c's comments are spot on, based on my experience.
the service and ambiance are both above average, but the food is entirely unremarkable.
moreover, execution and presentation were sub-par.
all in all a total disappointment.
would indicate zero stars if that was an option.
go anywhere else.
beyond my realtor.
i would rather turn down an offer than deal with this company again.
he said its not cloudy.
he didn't want to work, then gave me a quote for a new pump.
he also gave me a quote to change the motor out.
however, it quickly went downhill from there.
these people are jerks.
first, they tried to sell me a suit that obviously did not fit.
incompetence bordering on deceit + insulting your customers = never again.
over rated, greasy, slow.
tasted like a regular turkey burger with an egg and lots of has grease.
muffin was not with it..it was cold, dry and typical...not worth$5
the food is not good at all.
delivery took over an hour and we live not even a mile away.
i wouldn't eat here ever again.
bought a living social voucher for a pedicure.
called to schedule an appointment right when they opened.
just cancelled my voucher.
i just don't even know what to say besides that service here is awful.
this is extremely rude.
children are part of society and sometimes they cry.
bad experience ever.
he would not let me speak.
he was rude implied that i was stupid for complaining to corporate.
james can't handle the pressure.
there is a pep boys next door.
go there instead.
i'm a long time customer of this location...
i admired the cleanliness of the location.
i am truly upset!
this place is awful.
we (my friends and daughter) had an appointment and we were separated.
my lady was incredibility rude and kept yawning.
my feet were in the same awful condition as before.
don't bother with this establishment.
find a different one that will appreciate your business.
i will never go back.
biggest scam ever!
do not buy from this company or a door sales person ever!
scam scam scam.
never do any business with this company.
6 guests in our party on wednesday, 6/6 with food poisoning the next day.
worst 3 days of my life, and ruined the trip to vegas.
i am 7 months pregnant and my doctor is rebecca tyhre.
very disorganized office.
wow one of the worse service i have ever received by the staff.
no one should be denied or refused service or even ignore.
the managers are gay literally i would never go back.
dirty silverware and plates nasty
honestly, you should look elsewhere with the 1 tb data cap.
if you hate your mother-in-law then this is the place for her.
older door with issues, but working.
tech tells my wife it not fixable and needs to be replaced.
she had him call me.
he explains in detail and quotes $1400.
he wasn't happy.
10 minutes later calls back to say could get price down to $800.
we didn't bite and had another guy come out.
dead betta fish.
my heart is broken from the cruelty.
i'm sure they are rarely fed and they live in gross water.
shame on you wal-mart.
my pcp referred me to this dr on 8/31/16.
i see my pcp again friday to get a new referral.
hope the dr reads this.
one star is too much for this place!
we had high hopes for a tasty dinner.
we were underwhelmed and very disappointed with the food.
i ordered pulled pork with vinegar slaw and baked beans.
never going back!
update: got a full refund and they were very nice and professional.
refused service at 8:10 on a saturday night (1/7/177) open sign was on.
restaurant was full of koreans.
i guess white people aren't welcome here when it's busy.
drove out of the way and the place looks abandoned.
wish i could give zero.
do not enter.
go next door to whiskey row.
they let us in vip.
great music good deal on drinks.
stay away from this hefe location
the final straw, no napkin served in my basket.
today was the last straw, i will not be returning!
went in to have have some rims laced with new spokes.
i was told i needed to talk with the tech.
he never did help me.
he said that was 2 years ago.
i would not use them for service.
i was really disappointed in this cirque show.
i loved mystere and "o" but this was nothing like those shows.
the worse part was all the break dancing.
yes, break dancing to the beatles.
not worth the price, even if it was free.
go see mystere instead.
my poor postmate came to this location around midnite on july 4, 2017.
my postmate was kind enough to pay for the missing portion of my order.
customer, always right.
i won't be sending postmates to this location anymore, nor visiting this location anymore.
to james b of audio express on gilbert drive.
your response i find troubling.
one mistake could of cost someone a life.
just had a terrible experience here!
do not go!!!
seems legit right...
lol unmmm i guess they think customers in toronto are stupid or something...
just be careful of the bait and switch and shady employees
is it possible to give 0 stars?
my mother and i were in this store yesterday and purchased a dress.
they did not.
i got my nails done today (may 12, 2018).
medi and pedi both.
paid $40 and a couple of hours later, my nails are all chipping.
it is a total rip-off.
i have paid less for better service at other spas.
i do not recommend and will not be returning.
wish i could give no stars.
but what can you expect from westgate....
brutal customer service.
as a former discount brokerage employee in toronto myself, this operation is amateur hour.
of course i told him to go fuck himself!
*click* oh well, off to interactive brokers!
basic flavors, let alone the "authentic indian".
service is not nearly up to par.
not looking forward to come back..
and none of us seemed to enjoy our food..
that's six different plates..
money not well spent unfortunately
i really wanted to like this place.
never, ever coming back!
casablanca express is the worst !!!!
absolutely horrible customer service.
i don't even want to to rate casablanca express it deserves a zero!!!!!!!!!
obviously if i was standing in line....
they wasted my entire 30 minute break.
now i must eat on my time, unpaid.
coffee was fine.
however, tonight they had the darkest lighting i have eaten in.
it was reminiscent of the ice storm .
when candles and minimal lighting was only available.
we had the beef with broccoli and spicy eggplant with the california salads.
they were tasty, but 75%  of the pleasure eating food is seeing it.
which was not possible in low light.
horrible service and poor quality.
the place is filthy with bugs.
bought gelato and espresso both to disappointment.
rude & arrogant people!
its our first time going there!
lost our reservation for valentines after i msde it a month ago!
husband was overseas and was going to surprise him..
they completely ruined it and made no effort to correct it.
i'll be sure to spread the word about your establishment.
thanks for ruining our special day.
what can i say...
service does not exist here.
spend a few more bucks and go with a more reputable provider...
it's worth it.
no greeting whatsoever...
not family friendly.
we were the only ones at the restaurant.
worst haircut ever.
it was even a men's cut!!
that's actually not a compliment.
unprofessional, poor quality.
i am the customer with the defective dining room table.
i used to be/am an extremely loyal customer to this particular location.
for the past five years, i've come every sunday before church.
the staff has been very nice.
lately, though the staff has been nice, the service has been horrible.
once i got my order, it was completely wrong!
i won't be coming here again :(
i also tasted the chinese food for my kids and it also terrible.
how can you mess up chinese food?
rude employees, place is dirty, food was alright, not the same as back then.
the fettucini alfredo was one of the worst i've had in montreal.
very bland and tasted weird.
the pizza was cold and dry.
it tasted like a thawed out stale frozen pizza.
the harvest salad presentation was not the same and the taste was average.
the place was slow which would suggest better service, however that was not true.
too many others in the valley which are so much better.....
not worth the money.
the eggplants were undercooked.
sushi rolls falling apart.
salad was so so.
our server was great so i'll give 1 star.
i personally am not going back here after i read this: http://montreal.eater.com/2015/7/20/9003367/montreal-sushi-999-restaurant-micebe careful..
i'm currently looking for a new salon and unfortunately this salon is a dud.
however, i'm not paying for any of those things.
we sat at one of the tables in the second row from the stage.
the high tones were actually painful to my ears.
there was a mixed-age audience, but mainly older folks.
song requests were largely from the 80s.
it's not too busy but there's a reason.
this is a sad excuse for a business.
just tried calling to ask a couple questions.
that was the exact thing he said.
there were so many other ways this could have been worded.
great first impression!!!!!!
booked two nights, stayed one.
going to the marriott.
tripped on this hazard twice.
there is also construction going on, apparently the are remodeling.
however, i think they should just tear it down.
so, if you also enjoy lots of construction, go ahead and stay here.
horrible produce, long lines...the usual for wal mart.
the aggravation definitely makes the minimal savings not worth it.
this subway somehow always makes me sick.
i suggest not ordering anything there and making a sandwich at home.
it was not good and the wait was really long.
the iced coffee i got was over iced.
i didn't enjoy the fries but the wings were ok.
it made me feel dirty just standing there!
don't eat here!
we each took only one bite at left the rest.
my husband and i have to loyal to this place since they opened.
my time is too important to me to bring my car here again.
don't waste your time.
do not stay here- stay at palazzo...
while the games are a lot of fun, the service here is consistently horrible.
this place is a joke!
i'm not coming to this location any more.
worst fast food service i've ever had and that's saying something.
if burnt crust is your thing, then choose humble pie in the phoenix airport!
i stood for nearly 20 minutes waiting for them to make two pizzas.
do not waste your time waiting in line or visiting this establishment.
maybe the other pizza places are faster but this one can't get it right.
do not go here!
my story is much like everyone else's.
still no package the next morning at 8:33 am.
checked with ontrac and they still have it out for delivery.
they are the absolute worst!!
worst quality i have ever seen.
took my money.
then never returned the phone after repeated calls.
the food was terrible.
we had the surprise 3 course meal, and honestly i was really disappointed.
our first course was the most boring, dry, salad.
my date didn't even eat it.
the food is comparable to crappy wedding/catering food.
by the time our dessert came we were ready to get out of there.
veronica the server is horrible!
worst service i've had in my life!
i don't know how she still has a job!
the worst company ever!
don't turn them away just because we're 10 min's late, and 1 person short...
that's what happened to me, to top it off, it was my birthday....
we waited over 15 minutes to get our food!
the place was almost empty.
the food then came out cold and not very good.
the potato wasn't hot, chopped salad had huge pieces of lettuce.
i wouldn't go back.
the manager here is very rude.
did not want to rectify issues of honesty or quality.
the customer is definitely not first with this establishment.
went to the pharmacy once here and i never want to go back.
if you want to get interrogated by a pharmacy tech this is your place.
ok, so fast forward one month and they no longer carry my prescription.
what a joke this place is.
this mall is immaculately clean, and up kept.
it seems to have a decent variety of stores.
each dog is even taken out for a walk.
these dogs are sickly, lethargic, and depressed.
its called "pick of the litter".
have been here before a few times, alright service/experience/work for the cheap prices.
you simply don't treat your customers this way.
never coming back.
the service department is extremely rude and unhelpful.
horrible customer service, come on guys!
food comes late...
soggy and cold.
they won't make it right!!
really you can't give me ranch that i asked for?!
we keep giving changes to make it right and they just making excuses.
don't order here!
it was not even worth the $39 introductory rate.
the therapist didn't seem to care about my wants or needs.
guess you get what you pay for.
went in for a pedicure and fill.
sat in the massage chair for 45 minutes before anyone started the pedicure.
my husband i were married october 8, 2016.
we have not received a single image.
our last communication with amanda was an email from february 2017.
if you have experienced something similar with amanda please contact me at recovermissingmemories@gmail.com
the employees there are rude!
the customer in front of us was done paying so we approach the register.
i think this employee had her job title mixed up.
she must have thought she was working as a tsa lol ....what a joke!
silly employee, security's for the tsa lol
$50/month for 12 months for $600 total- the amount of the in-store promo).
i was ripped off.
not a pleasant experience.
i have no intention of returning.
what a decline in everything.
i used to go all the time, i'd never return again.
wow this place is a total rip off.
first vegas buffet and i'm extremely disappointed.
the selection was limited and the food was tasteless.
all the hot food was cold.
just save your money and go somewhere else.
this guy is a scumbag.
my husband was hospitalized in 2013 at north vista.
in the kindest of terms, he is a piece of crap.
they don't care about the patient your just another paycheck to these worker bees
i have received lush bath bombs for gifts, they are great!
if you want a relaxing bath.....
:(    they are sooooooo bad !
don't waste your money
the service is not great and the stinky tofu is absolutely repulsive.
also the kung pao chicken had far too many red peppers.
would not go again
heard about this place and how good the food was.
won't be going back.
i think i will be sticking to chipotle for awhile.
also, the black beans were overcooked and were clumpy and kinda dry.
sadly warner family patrice only cares about $$$.
they schedule extra tests without explaining why the tests are needed.
early morning appointments, pa/doctors are never on time which backs up the entire day.
they just called me again today about my appointment in october.
the patient portal is a joke.
first and last time for me!
we sat at a table in front of the bar from 6:50 till 7:45.
never got any help and were totally ignored.
i finally asked the bartender for menus.
still no service, it was if we were invisible.
we left and went elsewhere, got treated well at the next place.
hope the owner sees this review.
i didn't get his name he was arrogant black hair male slightly built.
this place seems lost in that rare space a few levels below rock bottom.
makes dufferin mall look like the mall of america by comparision.
lcbo is reasonable enough and the price chopper is reasonable enough as well.
everything else is god awful at best.
words cannot express how overdue this place is for an upgrade.
won't be returning there again.
the food is unhealthy and mediocre.
the ambiance is too loud to allow you relax and eat.
bad music was playing at high volume (this was sunday, 10pm).
the fish is not fresh and has a foul odor.
i will not order from here again.
worst pizza service ever, wish i could do half a star.
called back no service
we left shortly thereafter.
why is this place still in business?
great front desk team but sometimes an apology is not enough.
i was finally able to grab a nearby waiter to talk to the manager.
check out the pictures.
beautiful location and decor but horrible management, horrible, beware of mentor, ohio's maraca's!!!
ordered the chicken salad sandwich.
waste of money, should've just gone to a fast food place.
when you order items online you can't always choose who delivers your packages.
what else can i say?
it's in a good location.
include it in a bar crawl.
the booze is cheap and gets the job done.
just don't eat the food for god's sake.
we rented a car from phoenix, arizona and returned it to st. george, utah.
over priced items you can get anywhere.
never once saw an employee or was acknowledged.
make sure you don't order a milkshake you will be met with much attitude.
it was a solid waste of 6$.
so fairs warning expect great anger if you ask for a shake.
i called 3 times, each 3-4 weeks apart, never heard back.
the last time her answering machine said to make appts online, so i did.
got an email confirming appt, day of appt she didn't show.
don't waste your time or money.
luckily groupon gave me my money back.
the sears employees didn't even know when they closed.
i got there well before 7 and they were already closed for the night.
we would be fined by security if we closed early.
that's poor customer service.
what a damn restaurant!
wait way too long, almost an hour after hostess said 30 to 40 minutes.
food not worth the lie about wait time!
the food selection is pretty decent for the price point.
crab legs, seafood (?), prime rib etc.
food is bland and really has no flavor.
golden corral is better than this place
slowest front desk agents in the terminal.
not sure what the other 2 agents are doing at their computer screens.
i've been waiting in line for 40mins now.
not friendly at all, what an old grump!!!
never going back.
guess i'll take my money where they appreciate the customers.
the food is "meh" at best - nothing special at all.
wasn't horrible, but wasn't great either.
why the 1 star?
because they don't validate parking.
or read this - and simply skip this place.
first and last time in this barber shop.
i took my son in for a haircut and we were turned away!
disappointing, to say the least.
mediocre (cold) chips and salsa.
good margarita (i upgraded to milagro tequila).
they can put in the garbage or "re-gift"!!!
will not be returning...too many really good mexican food restaurants in the valley.
food quality and appearance way down.
portions are small.
service is diminishing.
not any more.
very high pressure sales!
i had the turkey apple brie bacon sliders and was greatly disappointed.
my husband said the same thing about the roast beef sliders.
oh and the chips?
stale ruffles...just sayin.
therefor, my family and friends will never eat at wendy's again!
will never go back again !!
i would avoid this store and visit another location.
case in point, a hand-soap-offering attendant in the men's restroom; truly ridiculous...........
first line the girl was stuck with a customer and no help.
not going back.
worst service ever.
don't know the menu and takes forever.
go to popeyes down the road.
this is a scam!!!!
the call number is phony and the decals don't work.
they take your money and give you broken merchandise!
do not bring your car here!
we immediately went inside to speak with a manager.
take your business elsewhere!
slow and expensive.
wish i would have stayed with cox.
cheaper and faster.
horrible customer service.
it's 2018 no one has cash on them anymore and service was the worst.
one star because i can't give zero starts.
take my advice do not walk away from acanac, run away from acanac.
service is in same category.
nothing but headache.
take my advise and run away.
poor attitude & not friendly at all!
only looking for how to charge you more.
find another store to take your business to that will appreciate their customers!
awful- even by mcdonald's standards.
my family and i came here to eat dinner and everything was good.
i we will never be back to this location.
it's also cramped and tiny inside.
if your over 60 then this place is for you.
this place is a dump.
everything seemed so shady as soon as we showed up.
needless to say, we immediately turned around and got our money back and left.
straight up disappointed.
i've been here several times and the story is always the same.
the food is usually fine, but i think i'll take my business elsewhere.
worst customer service i've ever experienced.
i made a appointment at 330 to look at watches.
they schedule it for 630.
i come in at 625 and tell them i'm here for my appointment.
i was sent to someone to check me in.
i can't find you he says.
so here i am standing here like an idiot wondering what's going to happen.
shitty customer service.
i figured it was an up-sale.
funny thing is, i have never grinded my teeth.
yeah, i wouldn't suggest this place.
it took one year and a half to fine the owners......
absolutely do not stay here!!!!!!!!
meth and crack whore haven!!!!
rudest dispatcher ever...maybe he was having a bad day.
had to cancel my order half way.
not going to use them again.
yelp - please take note.
made the mistake of eating here and regretted it.
noodles was bland, had no flavor.
do yourself a favor and walk past this place.
i've been to a dozen other penn stations and never had this issue.
you be the judge.
lines here are so long.
the manager brad sometimes just seems not present.
come on trader joes get present to these lame lines.
dan dan noodles were horrible and shanghai noodles were mediocre at best.
both dishes had very little meat.
pass on this place.
no wonder people abandon these places in favour of nearby frachise fast food outlets.
they said the would call me when finished.
went back 6 hours later & the tire was still not repaired!!!
stay away from this place.
i will never return to this location again!
i tried out their demo program.
i was ready to purchase 2 new rackets until i ran into this guy.
it's actually open, but doesn't matter..it's like the restaurant is closed.
don't go here.
i would give it zero stars if i could.
we just left and went to another restaurant nearby and was immediately served.
terrible experience getting a battery replaced in my raymond weil watch.
while the service was quick, condensation started immediately forming inside the watch.
clearly, asking a camera technician to replace a watch battery wasn't smart.
do not go here for any technical repairs.
came at 7:35p on monday night for prime rib night...
and they ran out of prime rib?
pure let down.
what a bunch of scammers.
my reserved car was gonna be an extra 40 mins ....bs.
so they could upgrade me for a mere $150.
i put my foot down and they folded.
this place is pathetic ****poor service and food.
not greek owned.
they play latino music in a "greek restaruant"...
the food is not authentic and atmosphere is uncomfortable.
not particularly clean and the service is very slow.
dont waste your time.
the only nice thing about it was the sesame seeds sprinkled on top.
the imperial rolls were bland and also obviously frozen.
would not recommend this place.
do yourself a favor and walk to chinatown and get good asian food.
super poor service, waited hours not much of food selection cart come around.
plate and cups are dirty.
walked in and the lady told me there was no wait for a pedicure.
she set me up with a bubbling foot bath.
never had a chance to start servicing me.
a customer came in for waxing.
she left to take care of them.
another customer came in for a pedicure.
she left to take care of them and stayed with them the entire time.
i walked up and left.
service was decent but food was terrible.
reuben wasn't even toasted.
a side salad was just a mound of iceberg lettuce.
drinks were ok.
overall not impressed and don't need to go back.
the bread was good.
wont be returning.
not sure i can give this mcdonalds even 1 star.
you're in the drive thru for an average of 10-15 minutes.
not worth the stop at all.
there is no ticket price that would be worth flying with this airline.
the compensation was a free soda.
people would come in after us and were getting taken care of before us.
the biggest issue i have with this gym is its maintenance.
i've gone to this establishment two other times and had no issues.
however there is a first time for everything.
i stopped by today at around noon, ordered a coconut milk tea with boba.
to be told they have run out of boba.
this was definitely the last time i go here.
i will stick to no. 1 boba tea.
the most expensive market around and they never have their samples available.
i do not have the experience of being treated with respect or appreciated.
i dread shopping here and am actively seeking and alternative market to shop at.
never have experienced a car rental checking with a 40 minute wait.
take a number like you are at the deli!
my cell phone blows up every day thanks to quicken loans.
thanks quicken loans.
i'm just waiting for this restaurant to appear on ch 5's dirty dining.
i ordered your basic run of the mill pho tai.
the bean sprouts were slimy, the lime was rotten.
i have called the maricopa county dept of health and reported the incident.
if you value your health, stay the hell away from this place!!!
nope, just no way do you go here.
was concerned about hygiene all the time!
the spoons were dirty, and just no no no.
the samosa is just not authentic, jalebi is bad with a wired oil taste.
was so hungry so had all of my 'super special thali'.
but nothing of the nature of its name at all!
food came sporadically.
salads disappointed immensely.
guest of honor was always served last.
dessert was pathetic.
my mom likes this place only for their lettuce wraps and mango salad :s
that place sucks never will i ever go there!!!
i ordered food to go tonight for my family.
talk about incompetence.
this is my third time writing this review.
they had yelp delete the first review, 4 years after the fact.
i reposted it and they had it taken down again.
i found them to be unprofessional.
this is the ultimate riip off tourist trap.
i returned all their calls and emails and they just played games with me.
good at wasting your time, terrible at finding you some place to work.
oh well, their loss.
omg, this was my absolute worst waxing experience ever.
i have huge welts just above and on the side of my eyebrows.
i still had a hair below my chin after she did my lower face.
seriously, i don't think it's possible to do a worse job.
this review is for the nordstrom at the fashion mall.
i bought a katie may dress which upon arrival fit me almost perfect.
the 'wedding suit' consultant thought we should 'take it out' some at the sides...
it was the wrong thing to do...
i still have a sour taste in my mouth.
buyer be aware!
i can't actually say how the spray tan was because i never got one.
i emailed them a second time when they were back and got no response.
but i do know to not count on them.
horrible customer service.
many times you sit in an aisle and no one comes to help.
all of this during saturday's?
manager must be a weak.
i guess we'll be eating disappointment for lunch.
last night the smoked chicken wings were tough and chewy.
that leaves me nothing to order other than beer and free peanuts.
i would have been better off going to the grocery store..
its totally not worth getting a cake form here...
i can list off so many reasons why .
first she was 30 minutes late !!
my hair had completely torn off of my scalp .
real hair !!
i will never, ever go to this starbucks again.
the barista was a very nasty women.
she was unfriendly and flat out rude.
when she called out my drink she said "unsweetened ice coffee".
she said "i don't know can you just taste it and find out".
i was totally taken a back.
went there to buy a car today.
walked around the lot for 20 mins and another 15 mins wandering around inside.
i am disappointed.
it wasn't glued on right and my eyes burned too.
sorry pop lashes, you have disappointed me and i wouldn't come back.
worst customer service ever.
save yourself the headache!
my last oil change there took 2 hours to complete!
incredibly terrible service and food.
waitress is put off to serve you.
value and quality are low
we had a reservation to pick up our car at 9 am this morning.
almost 45 minutes later we are still sitting here waiting for our car.
no apologies or responsibility taken before then or since.
believe the negative reviews and avoid this location.
worse experience ever, my daughters birthday was ruined.
i am beyond saddened my daughters special day was ruined due to their negligence.
just because it wouldn't let me continue did i give it 1 star
is it fair to review a restaurant based on it's valentines day menu?
if possible avoid this place!
the ideas of it seem great!!!
but the service and food was below standard.
they forgot something we ordered and served us dry pulled in pork.
she didn't offer to bring us any other sauces.
should have ran then!
forced to eat my ice and would not accept palm reading.
however, i did appreciate the spinning door.
overall, if you're at legacy village and you want to eat...
go to stir crazy.
hope to try again in the future.
there are much better brazilian restaurants.
the poor service overshadowed the food.
i'm never going back.
the new manager is a rude bartender and scaring people away
who turns a buffet into a cafeteria?
walked in, took the tour, and walked out.
soup plantation you have made a very big mistake with this endeavor.
thats pretty shady if you ask me.
this is not a four star coffee joint.
first impression  was of an extremely dirty run down shop.
they had none so they had to make it fresh.
the coffee taste was lacking in all senses to the taste buds.
do not bother calling this guy.
i'm only leaving one star because i have to.
i'd prefer not to leave any stars.
we were assigned to him by our home warranty company.
same answering message and no return call.
if your home warranty company assigns you to this guy, ask for someone else!
i showed up at 7:48 on a sat.
night and was informed they were out of carne asada.
that's like an ice cream store saying they're out of ice cream.
don't go there, or if you do, good luck!
we've been  here a few times and had sushi only.
the price is $10-$15 for the rolls.
the place has food that never tastes 100% fresh.
the seaweed around the fish is always chewy.
one time we waited 30 min before we were even offer water.
not very clean, the floors are sticky.
never going back.
chris miller is a liar & a thief!!
this guy is so crooked.
lies lies lies.
took my insurance $$ and did not do the repairs.
insurance adjuster confirmed they didn't do the work.
now has an insurance fraud case against him.
this guy is a scumbag!!
fraud fraud fraud
basically i was being stupid from the start.
do not eat here!!!
i recently applied for a home with the landbank property management company.
prices are terribly high compared to other children's resale shops.
i wish i read yelp before going to this place.
i will never go back.
the service was very poor.
the waitress was unkind, and unhelpful.
the quality of the food was below average!
i couldn't eat the edamame!
i will never sponsor this rest
slow service on a tuesday night.
food was slow.
and...washroom ran out of paper towels.
we will never return after this horrible experience.
hotel is under renovation, and has no elevator service.
this place is awful!!
we didn't make the mistake?
don't go here, save your money.
these people were completely unprofessional.
if i can give 0 zero stars i would.
played this course today, course was in ok shape.
i do not recommend this course.
this mall is incredibly disappointing from how nice it once was.
all the good stores that were there all are gone.
simply drive a little farther and visit arrowhead or pv mall.
great finds .
this place is terrible.
wendy who is the manager touched my left tit...
because i wouldn't talk back to her...
security sucks and are mean to females.
fire wendy she touched my left tits!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
filing a police report now
that equates to less than a dollar of savings per smoothie.
i heard the ad the same day i came in.
pretty disappointing for a first time visit.
don't think i'll come back
took 30 min without exaggerating, because the employees were arguing.
poor poor management.
the nutella filled  puffs were  so hard like rocks...
for $150 they would repair the software.
won't let them go near any of my electronics again.
better seen as a fast food joint than a real restaurant.
we were in/out in 45 minutes.
the white breast meat was dried out.
obviously not prepared to order.
awful french fries and inedibly over-spiced rapini.
really indifferent service.
$13 for express gas charge because i could not produce a receipt for gas?
tank says full!!!!
you are relying on people to not fight you when they are busy.
make sure you bring your gas receipt when you return the car.
otherwise some bs fee
miranda was recommended by our realtor along with 2 others.
theirs was the least expensive estimate so we went with them.
they also didn't have wi-fi like most subways.
sorry subway but i'm never coming back to this location.
:(  to bad i put one star for it.
this is by far the worst burger king i've ever encountered!
i went to the drive thru and ordered a double cheeseburger with bacon.
i took it back into the store to get it switched out.
never coming to this shithole ever again
i will never rent through this company again.
car got a leak that eventually blew out and changed the spare.
only to find the spare halfway inflated.
then that tire blew out as well.
i visited this place yesterday with family and friends.
terrible ending to our meal!
this is the worst mac in the entire city!!!
the girls are extremely rude and racist.
they have no business sense on how to speak to clients.
friendly service and thats about it.
the table (and area around table) were terribly unclean.
it is very clearly a deep level of uncleanliness.....
we looked at the window ledge below table and were astonished.
management ought to deploy even a minimal cleaning regime to the facility.
have taken them off the list!!!!
food was well below average.
would not return, this place is just awful.
it's in dire need of renos.
i walked out while they were wrapping my flowers because they were being rude.
$50.00 for 20 tulips is a joke.
as-is it's borderline airplane food.
i had no words to say.
i asked them a question and they straight up ignored me.
never coming to this location again.
i told her i had asked and she messed it up.
customer service has gone down hill in the last year and so has behavior.
waited well over an hour to get into take tour.
most of the interactive activities did not work.
not worth the money.
check your bill closely!
if i could do 0 stars i would.
terrible place smh
that really is ridiculous.
its south scottsdale on a slow sunday and we definitely won't be back.
so your telling me that bc i'm not an "elite" member...
deserves less than a star....
an egg in it.
who leaves watermelon in 106 wicked vegas heat????
it's all about money they don't care about your health at all.
their medical knowledge is zero!
any many other wrong diagnosis or wrong treatment.
and plus they have the rudest staff everdon't recommend it at all!
my car dealer's inspection lasted about 40 minutes at the absolute most.
3 hours is unacceptable and i will not be going back there.
head to the scarborough/markham store for better service.
you must be kidding??
terrible to think that the once venerable spot is no longer.
would have been better to have simply torn it down.
i've been here a couple of times for lunch.
the food has no taste.
i say save your money and go to a taco truck.
even a run down taco truck would be better than this place.
came this morning for breakfast with my aunt and uncle.
i sent it back and ordered 2 eggs over easy and bacon.
they arrived over hard.
had to then ask for toast.
they forgot my uncle's sausage.
had to ask for our drinks.
don't know if it was one cook or a new cook.
i know it's legal but c'mon.
at least don't go out in full uniform.
(don't they drug test?)
i will never contact this company again.
the contractor that did come was very nice and very informative though.
i would never return to this restaurant after the horrible experience last night.
dined here with a group of 10.
on top of this, our food was mediocre at best.
would not recommend this place to anyone.
have to rate a one at best.
only one bartender/ waitress in the restaurant.
no apology, didn't want our business.
then went to teakwoods and received great service.
on 6/27/16 i called and spoke to rebecca the office manager/ front desk receptionist.
this was for a former tenant of theirs and very dear friend of mine.
she was rude, unprofessional and very short with me.
maybe her company should invest in some customer service classes for her.
i hung up and started a claim procedure with the post office.
this buffet is cheap for a reason!
the food is extremely dry (even their pasta?!) and very lacking in flavor.
it tasted like everything had been sitting out for hours.
not fresh at all...and it was lunch time!
but maybe that's the desperation talking.
if you're only going to one buffet go to cesars or bellagio!
unbelievable,  made appointment for 11:30, am still waiting 40 minutes later.
check with desk, they say your appointment is scheduled for 12.
so the scheduler just arbitrarily schedules for 12 and tells me 11:30.
super annoyed right now
absolutely horrible service, horrible job.
and will recommend others don't as well.
they f***** my kids hair up.
worst service ever!!!!!!!
whne that gen manager erik say you can do anything..
i made a reservation 3 wks in advance.
this was at 9.00pm at night.
avoid payless (aka,careless) at all costs!
of course there was no apology.
ended up with $75 bill when it should be $40.
total rip off and the worst service ever.
absolutely disgusting unless you like totino's pizza.
pretty sure the italian sausage was cat food.
i won't be eating here again until it gets cooler
if you're vegan, save yourself the time and expense of this dump.
it came with a tiny serving of an antipasto "salad" which was rotten.
i also ordered a side salad and it was literally lettuce only!
the prices and the quality of food couldn't have been further apart.
this might be the worst restaurant i've ever been to.
i'd definitely give zero stars if that were an option.
trying somewhere else.
so junky and cluttered!
prices aren't good either!
i walked in and left after a few minutes.
i love to shop but the disorganization was a little too much for me.
just skip this place and go to the goodwill a few stores down.
security was truly awful.
i must say i'm disappointed and would never return again.
paid for tickets in advance to see chris brown saturday night.
and we had already bought tickets!!
and i'm sure plenty of others from that night feel the same way.
if i could give this cheesecake factory zero stars i would!
the 2 appetizers we ordered took 45 minutes to come out.
i'm.from las vegas, i'm in pittsburgh visiting my fiance's family.
the sandwich was small, maybe 5 oz.
of meat and cheese.
the rye bread was typical midwest soft, and the meat was tasteless.
i paid $9.81 for the sandwich, chips, and iced tea.
he was always on the phone asking someone else for help.
another technician eventually showed up to assist.
i completed the survey and pointed out that he did not finish.
choose someone other than safelite.
i went through the drive thru.
i ordered 2 street tacos.
the tortilla was delicious but the meat sucked.
not to mention i waited over 10 minutes for my order.
terrible customer service.
good riddance to these crooks.
in town for work and was really excited to try this place.
unfortunately, i was disappointed when i sat at the bar and was ignored.
after five minutes of several workers looking at me without addressing me i left.
they just don't care and very unprofessional.
i can't believe the franchise isn't pulled from them as they are terrible!
i will never go to another fazolis after this one...
if i could give them no stars i would.
these people mind my language have fucked us over every single month.
welp guess fucking what.
they pulled the money and then i got over drafted again!!!
and every time i call they tell us that we never requested it.
save yourself your sanity and go through another agency.
worst casino i have ever had the displeasure of stepping foot in.
extremely rude and curt staff.
classless and low brow  clientele.
very filthy and unkept place all together.
i decided to try them again.
8th 2016...my visit feb.
11thanother guy was by the grill and checking his messages.
burrito tasted okay.
the men are drunk disasters who believe they have the right to touch you.
thank goodness 157 came and offered a more worthy dance floor.
this location never gets my drive thru orders right.
today the person cut me off as i was giving my order.
i asked if she heard what said.
her response was yes.
of course my order was not right at the window.
then i had to wait while the rest of my food got cold.
i would much rather drive to the indian land location.
if i could have given no stars i would have.
i do not suggest doing business with this place.
best of luck!
who puts crumbled shrimp in tacos ??
stay away !
obviously this firm is too busy to return necessary phone calls.
i just ordered this place off of uber eats and it was pretty terrible.
i ordered the rare beef and meatball pho and they actually forgot my meatballs.
i was stuck with like 3 thin strips of rare beef.
then i try the actual pho and the broth was flavorless and really greasy.
what a mess.
horrible first impression, rr brew co!
place is easy to get too, not friendly at all!!
also short changed me.
would not come back especially with the bad atmosphere.
get your own professional installer, as their quotes are much higher than the rest.
by far the worst panda express experience ever.
the service was horrible.
their customer service even worse.
i threw my lunch in the trash.
a total waste.
worst place ever!!!
we bought a $300 mattress pad along with a $1700 mattress.
had a reservation for 8am.
told me to come back at noon.
i've had progressive for about 2 years.
we may not run your motor vehicle reports often.
you are notified about suspensions from the state themselves.
generally if we have be made aware, we will send you out a notice.
kama l:why would progressive renew a policy when the driver cant drive?
progressive.:not typically.
terrible, the absolute worst!
packages are thrown in the bushes half way up the driveway.
have called several times to complain, same results.
for all future orders i will specifically ask for any other shipping.
ontrac is the most unreliable shipping i have ever encountered.
i'm glad to have hones neighbors who bring me my packages.
never use this company.
would have given negative star rating if possible.
unprofessional, over priced, not relaxing!
go to vega nails or royal nails, much better environment and prices!!
my delivery finally arrived after more than two hours.
it was cold, and they got the order size wrong.
i got the turtle cheesecake and husband got bailey's hot chocolate cheesecake.
very dense and reminded me of the frozen cheesecake samplers from the grocery store.
skip this place.
my burger tasted like a hot dog, straight up.
nothing like a beef patty.
it was really disgusting and i'm very disappointed.
this review is for an online order and for their customer service.
i recommend to go somewhere else to purchase your items.
worst place i've ever encountered.
save yourself and go somewhere else.
the food was alright.
the flavor was there but the chicken wasn't.
very small portions, even for the "huge" burrito.
that's unsanitary and honestly, i just found it odd.
personally, i would never come back here again or recommend this place.
this place is horrible.
come on over staff duh.
we will never try and go to this bar again!!!
i don't know...
the galley boy was the nastiest thing i've ever eaten anywhere!
this place used to be great when it was gobelieve.
i'd say i've been here roughly 20 times so....
the food is terrible!
sashimi was terrible and did not taste fresh at all.
you're trapped past airport security, so your options are limited.
food was overpriced (as may be expected) but bland.
the accompanying fries were unseasoned, limp, and underdone.
tim horton's is just down the terminal.
i paid $50 for a gel manicure that chipped less than 48 hours later.
terrible customer service from the manager.
will not be returning.
worst company in town.
needed a shower pan drain looked at for leaking.
guy comes out.
the company is a joke.
the cashier i had today was rude.
she yelled at the customers.
when i asked to see the manager, this young girl came.
she had no customer service experience.
rather than calm the customer down, she aggravated the customer even more.
hire experienced staff and make your customers want to go back to your supermarket.
you have great products but poor customer service!!
what's the point in having phone order when its never ready???
not only was i late i paid for a drink i didn't even get!!!!
don't order ahead at this location unless you give them 30 minutes in advance.
don't come in for a beer cuz they don't have any...
the staff seemed entirely disinterested in working or engaging the customers.
yes, there were tvs - half were tuned to infomercials.
most striking was the deafening silence -no music, no tv audio, no nothing.
i won't be going back.
like oh my god!
why do all the rental car companies use chevys?
i have unfortunately been a cox internet customer for more than a year.
avoid cox if you can.
cox nickel and dime customers for an extremely poor service.
and they even charge you $20 for self installation with your own equipment!!
customer service is nearly zero.
their reps lack proper training, are not informative and misguide customers.
the food is not fresh at all.
going near the fishmonger section is scary despite my love of sea food.
also doing business as bowdrie appliances.
she loves to correct and control.
acts like she is doing you a favor to work on your appliances.
got annoyed when i wouldn't give out the gate code.
insists on a 4 hour window of time.
refuses to accommodate a request like a call ahead.
interrupts and acts superior.
how do they stay in business?
hard and dry.
the place was filthy, service was terrible and average food was over priced.
i wont return.
i absolutely do not recommend this place to anyone!
used to live it here but new owners, no bueno.
portion size is half what it used to be.
service was ok
he charges $40 for travel and $5 per signature.
i don't know haha!
should have read the reviews first.
what can i say,i am not impressed.
the owner chris is the most unprofessional business owner i have ever dealt with.
not good customer service.
finally needed up leaving to go to a different location.
not one person the entire weekend smiled or said hello.
maybe it's a vegas thing, but me thinks not.
to top it off the valet has sticky fingers.
although the rooms look nice, they felt dirty.
but what a letdown!
the seafood paella was equally terribly done and terrible tasting.
by far the worst food i've had in a very long time!
i would not recommend this place at all...
worst meal ever.
worst meal and even worse service.
definitely won't be going back ever.
only giving a star because it requires me to put something!
this company is a total joke!
i would not recommend this company to anyone!
stay away from these stupid people!
tried to come in here with my friends to spend $$$.
apparently my friends' dresses weren't puritanical enough in las vegas?
mary is a total prude, avoid this place if you expect a vegas atmosphere...
molly's pizza just lost a longterm customer.
there was a mealy worm in my french fries.
when i called manager was not nice, challenging me...etc.
worst i've ever had.
worst experience of my life.
the girl working was so slow.
i was the only person who ordered a coffee to go.
i am literally disgusted and will never go back!
they over charged me what i would pay at any other salon...
will not be returning here and will not recommend anyone else does either
corporate got involved, and they were very generous and apologetic.
they are refunding us our money.
i do not believe this store reflects fred meyer as a whole.
the tucson location is great and they create excellent jewelry.
this is the worst thai food i have ever had.
do not trust these people!
jennifer ur horrible at ur job!!!
...and not answer ur phone?????
very unprofessional and i hope u get blacklisted!!!
this used be one of my favourite vn restaurants.
the spring rolls were tasteless and almost too tough to chew through.
and my #27 (vermicelli with assorted toppings) was cold.
i shall never return.
arrived at 9:35pm, and they told us the kitchen was closed.
most restaurants have to serve until their closing time (which was 10pm).
maybe it's just chinese places that stop serving?
i'm not sure.
they lost my business for good.
i know i should have called beforehand.
if i could give this restaurant zero stars i would.
it was that bad.
we had gone for my birthday  and it was our first time there.
the food was inedible.
and that is putting it kindly.
it was like taking $ 150 and burning it in front of me.
there was nobody at this place.
paid $9 for an awful california roll and some edamame .
i ate one piece and couldn't bring myself to eat another.
good thing i ordered edamame otherwise it would've been a complete waste.
never coming back.
the tempura was soggy, maybe one piece was crispy.
certainly felt like it had been sitting around.
the curry noodles were mediocre, at best.
you can get a better meal at tokyo bowl.
had ala carte last week for dinner, was good.
very bad customer service, at least be courteous.
pissed off with the treatment.
my previous review
came on friday night it was very busy and the service sucked.
our waitress threw the straws at us and it was just a bad experience.
definitely choose to spend your money somewhere else.
food poisoning right after having intestine with spicy sauce this wednesday.
this never happens to some other places close by.
i don't recommend this place.
if i could give zero stars i would.
rude and disrespectful.
please think again before calling this business.
sorry, but i believe sonny's bbq is the worst bbq that i've ever tasted.
the ribs, very dry...
chicken absolutely tasteless.
cornbread (if you can call it that) was so heavy..
more likely used as a weapon.
what a shame!!!
this place is the worst!
we ordered a thin crust pie and it came out soggy.
it was impossible to even hold it up with one hand.
the sauce is watery and overall the whole thing was just really disappointing.
if you're in town and craving pizza this is not the spot.
hop on the monorail and get off at harrahs/the linq station.
theres a pizza spot in the promenade that would be well worth the trek.
the service wasn't great, food was ok.
i basically paid $50 for a turkey club with fries and milkshake.
restaurants at the rio are definitely too pricey for the portion and quality.
never trust anything you eat at the rio!
it's off the strip and rundown for a reason.
never book a rom there!
came here for the "amazing" vegan nirvana pizza.
i can actually still form shapes with the dough, it's so completely raw.
burnt crust and raw middle.
waste of money.
will never be coming back.
nevermind that lets back up to a conversation he was having with another employee.
walked in today and asked for a table for three.
the place was packed because a ufc game was going on.
the waitress says there is going to be a wait.
she really didn't even sound like she wanted us there.
this place has the perfect storm of terribleness.
who knew you could find all of them in the same place!).
pretty sure i saw a kid, age 10-14, playing cornhole out front too.
1st off this place is not called robertos but don tortaco!
so here i am writing my review as i wait for my food.
got home and my carne asada plate had corn tortillas and not flour!
that might seem minor to some but i can't stand corn tortilla.
first and last time coming here!!!
..nice and red...but the inside...brown, unbelievable
terrible company bed bug infested!!!
i had to catch one and he still didnt looke just accepted it!
this is a dump!
only good for leaving trash!
someone thinks they are too big for their britches!
this is solon, ohio people, not nyc!!!
little confusing as what kind of establishment you're all promoting.
this used to be my favorite club.
never had an issue with the venue nor the staff.
for whatever reason, we weren't listed.
while i was waiting my turn the lady never changed her plastic gloves.
i will never eat from this place again.
definitely a health code violation !!!!
would give 0 stars if i could.
got into vehicle 216 with simon saif at the airport.
this is exactly why i use uber.
what a jerk
place is clean and organized.
i am seriously thinking of changing gyms.
do better at making customers happy instead of finding ways to inconvenience them.
second time here but the last.
first time combo burrito plate.
burrito was just ok, rice was very dry and refried beans with cheese good.
if i could give this place a big fat zero i would.
i am so bummed!
we moved around the corner and were eager to give this place a try...
similar to other reviews, horrible service, crappy drinks, and mediocre food.
we should have know.
the wings were honestly disgusting.
you get my point.....
they don't accept other locations coupons.
also not friend me and hard to get in and out of their driveway
order from home.
no craft beer and horrible service.
only time i have left a 1cent tip.
i was s server for years.
their delivery folk are the best!
had a truly awful, overpriced meal.
chicken tender on salad included literally a deep fried piece of pure gristle.
they don't even give u a number so everyone can wait in order!
for real !?
don't order your keg from them.
they will sell it to someone else.
we ordered ours over 2 weeks ago for pick up today.
we were told they sold it two days ago to someone else.
what is wrong with this place???
that's not how you do business.
not my favorite location of chipotle.
management needs to learn to train their employees to speak professionally with their customers.
ubique and adorable..."new stuff"....
however, i wasn't greeted or acknowledge, by the 2 women running the store.
they were more into sharing their stories about the last "vampire" facial they had...blehk..
oh well, their loss.
it's 3 o'clock now and i'm still in the room waiting .
my ride is about to leave back to work and i'll be stranded .
service is horrible .
love this location!
it's right on the corner of portage crossing next to aladdin's.
service is always fantastic and personable.
edited to update**kind of sad how awful this location has become.
i will be on the search for a new daily location.
the worst dental experience of my adult life.
